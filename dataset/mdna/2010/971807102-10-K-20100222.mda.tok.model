manage risk 
regularly invest our capital for future growth 
take a long term view 
in the pages that follow  we summarize our performance and discuss each of our businesses in more detail 
throughout this report  we use net loss income to mean net loss income attributable to wilmington trust corporation 
our comments in this report reflect our best estimates of the trends we know about  anticipate  and believe are relevant to future operations 
in the future  however  actual results may differ from our estimates 
executive summary there were many positive developments at our company in our capital position remained strong  we continued to attract new clients as well as more business from existing clients  and we kept a tight rein on expenses 
ccs had its best year ever  and core deposit balances at year end were billion  a record high 
these successes were not strong enough  however  to counter the recessionary pressures that affected all of our businesses  reduced revenue  and resulted in a net loss for the year of million 
after dividends and accretion on the preferred stock we issued to the us department of the treasury in conjunction with our participation in the capital purchase program cpp  the net loss available to common shareholders was million 
the chief factors in this loss were an increase in the provision for loan losses  which reduced net interest income 
this increase reflected higher levels of nonperforming loans and loan losses  as sluggish economic conditions continued to pressure commercial borrowers  especially in delaware 
the provision was million for  up from million for for more information about this  read the credit risk discussion and note  reserve for loan losses  in this report 
losses on securities that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired otti under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
losses on otti securities reduced net income by approximately million and earnings per diluted common share by approximately 
for more information about this  read the investment securities portfolio discussion and note  investment securities  in this report 
part ii item continued in addition  there were other contributing factors 
the low level of market interest rates compressed the net interest margin and reduced the fees we earn on money market mutual funds 
financial market volatility lowered the valuations of assets in client portfolios and depressed was revenue 
our federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance premium expense rose to million  up from million for economic conditions in the mid atlantic region remained challenging 
there were pockets of improvement  but they were uneven  and there were few indications that a broad recovery was underway 
loan demand dropped sharply  as the regional economy challenged borrowers 
in  our loan balances rose by nearly billion on an average balance basis  and by more than billion on a period end basis 
in comparison  the increase in loan balances  on average  was million 
on a period end basis  loan balances at year end were million lower than at year end our regulatory capital ratios continued to exceed the federal reserve s minimums to be considered a well capitalized institution 
given the economic environment  however  and the lack of earnings in  we took steps to further enhance our capital position 
we lowered assets by reducing our investment securities portfolio 
the slower pace of loan growth also affected asset levels 
in addition  we reduced our quarterly cash dividend twice in on january   our board of directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend from per common share to per common share 
on july   the board reduced the quarterly cash dividend to per common share 
these reductions stemmed from our desire to act with an abundance of caution during this period of economic uncertainty 
since it is difficult to predict when  or how quickly  an economic recovery might occur  we are being conservative in managing our capital in order to have flexibility in a dynamic environment and to hasten our exit from the cpp 
additional details about each of our three businesses and our performance are in the following sections of this report 
changes in financial condition our capital position remained strong in and all of our regulatory capital ratios were higher at year end than at year end  and all continued to exceed the amounts required by the federal reserve to be considered a well capitalized institution 
this was true both including and excluding the million in cpp funds we received in december discussing regulatory capital ratios without the cpp funds is a non gaap disclosure 
we believe this information is useful  and we include it here to provide a more complete picture of our capital position 
the decline in loan demand and the reduction in investment securities balances brought total assets at year end to billion  which was lower than at year end an increase in the reserve for loan losses also affected assets 
the reserve  which is recorded as a reduction in assets  was million at year end  up from million at year end loans continued to account for the majority of earning assets 
earning assets totaled billion at year end  down from billion at year end our earning assets consist of loans  investment securities  interest bearing deposits in other banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  and federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank stock 
our assets at december   included million in pre paid fdic deposit insurance premiums 
for more information about this  read the expense discussion in this report 
strong growth in core deposits in  coupled with the decline in investment securities balances  reduced our need for non core funding and changed the mix of liabilities on our balance sheet 
core deposits were billion at year end  up from year end on an average daily balance basis  core deposits provided of our funding in  up from in stockholders equity at year end was billion  a decrease of million from year end the main factors in this decrease were the net loss of million 
million in dividend payments on common stock and million in dividend payments and accretion on preferred stock issued under the cpp

investment securities portfolio we maintain an investment securities portfolio to generate cash flow  help manage interest rate risk  and provide collateral for deposits and other liabilities 
we do not acquire or hold investment securities for trading purposes 
there are no client funds in this portfolio 
our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of short term fixed income instruments  including us treasury securities  government agency bonds  mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds  obligations of state and political subdivisions primarily bonds issued by the state of delaware and municipalities in delaware  and other types of debt and equity securities 
our policy is to invest in securities that  at the time of purchase  have investment grade ratings of a or better from standard poor s or moody s investors service

we reduced the size of the portfolio in in order to improve our liquidity and because we had fewer deposits that required securities as collateral 
to achieve this reduction  we sold some securities  and we did not replace others as they matured or were prepaid 
most of these securities were mortgage backed and government agency securities 
while total investment securities balances decreased in  investments in short term us treasury securities increased 
most of this increase occurred in december  when we opted to invest some of the cash held at the corporation holding company level 
write downs on otti securities in also contributed to the portfolio shrinkage 
in  we recorded write downs of million and losses of million on otti securities 
in  we recorded write downs and losses of million on otti securities 
most of the write downs and losses we recorded in and were on pooled trust preferred securities trups 
a pooled trust preferred security is a security that aggregates groups  or pools  of trust preferred securities issued by banks  insurance companies  and other financial institutions into a single instrument 
many pooled trups declined in value in and  mainly because economic conditions rendered some of the underlying issuers in these pools incapable of meeting their associated cash flow obligations 
created illiquidity in the market for these securities 
part ii item continued at december   the amortized cost of the pooled trups portfolio was million  its carrying value was million and its estimated fair value was million 
all of our trups had investment grade credit ratings when we initially purchased them  but were downgraded subsequently as their valuations declined 
at december   of the pooled trups and two of the nine single issue trups in our portfolio had below investment grade credit ratings from either fitch ratings or moody s investors service

results of operations we reported a net loss of million for  compared with a net loss of million for these losses were a function of recessionary pressures that led to increases in securities losses and the provision for loan losses 
the net loss available to common shareholders was affected by adjustments for dividends and accretion on the shares of wilmington trust series a preferred stock issued to the us department of the treasury in conjunction with the cpp 
net loss income and earnings per share for the year ended december in millions  except share amounts net loss income dividends and accretion on preferred stock net loss income available to common shareholders net loss income available to common shareholders per fully diluted share the dividends and accretion on the preferred stock increased in because the preferred stock was outstanding for the full year  versus only a few weeks in we sold the preferred stock to the us treasury on december  
while the adjustment for dividends and accretion was higher  the net loss available to common shareholders was more favorable than for  because our reported net loss for was lower 
in  the net loss included a million impairment charge against the value of our investment in affiliate money manager roxbury capital management rcm 
wilmington trust corporation form k despite the recessionary pressures  there were many positive developments in for example we gained new clients and strengthened relationships with existing clients 
our focus on client relationships distinguished us amid difficult economic conditions and disruption in the financial services industry 
ccs achieved its best results ever 
ccs revenue and sales surpassed prior records in both and the retirement services acquisitions we completed in contributed to this growth  as did strong global corporate trust sales in a weak capital markets environment 
our diversified mix of businesses and revenue streams helped us withstand the effects of the recession 
noninterest income  most of which is generated by was and ccs  continued to increase as a percentage of our total revenue 
unfortunately  these positives were offset by changes in the economic landscape that reduced revenue 
the factors that had the most significant effect on our operating results in and included the extent  depth  and prolonged nature of the recession 
the downturn that began in and persisted throughout affected all three of our businesses negatively  but its most profound effect was on our regional banking business 
our net interest income decreased as new loan demand declined  and as an escalation in loan repayment problems led us to increase the provision and reserve for loan losses 
the provision was million for  compared with million for  and million for on an average balance basis  total loan balances increased less than in in comparison  strong demand generated record high loan growth in on average  loan balances for were higher than for changes in the market interest rate environment 
market interest rates reached historic lows at the end of and remained there throughout this caused declines in net interest income and compression in our net interest margin 
at  the margin for was basis points lower than for in addition to reducing net interest income  the interest rate environment reduced the management fees we earn on money market mutual funds 
in the second quarter  as yields on our money market mutual funds fell  we began to waive our management fees on these funds 
these waivers reduced revenue by approximately million 
volatility and disruption in the financial markets 
conditions in the financial markets negatively affected the valuations of assets in client portfolios and in our own investment securities portfolio  which affected our results in several ways 
most of our was revenue comes from fees that are based on the valuations of assets in client portfolios 
when those valuations decrease  there is a corresponding decrease in the associated fees 
compounding the lower asset valuations was the fact that volatility in the equity markets prompted many clients to invest a larger portion of their assets into fixed income instruments 
this shift reduced was revenue because  in general  the pricing on our fixed income and cash management services is lower than our pricing on equity investment management services 
the market volatility also affected valuations in retirement plan assets we manage or hold in custody  which muted growth in the ccs retirement services business 
in our investment securities portfolio  market conditions and valuation declines led us to determine that some of our investment securities were otti  which increased securities losses 
on an after tax basis  otti securities losses reduced net income by approximately million and earnings by approximately per common share 
we discuss these dynamics in greater detail in the following sections of this report 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest we earn on earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and other borrowings 
most of our net interest income is generated by loan and deposit activity in our regional banking business 
the was and ccs businesses also generate net interest income  because they have clients who use our banking services

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after the provision for loan losses part ii item continued the main factors in the and decreases in net interest income were the market interest rate environment  which compressed the net interest margin 
the reduction in investment securities balances 
the increase in the provision for loan losses  which is recorded as a reduction in net interest income 
higher levels of nonaccruing loans  which reduced the interest income we expected to receive in by million 
effect of nonaccruing loans on interest income for the year ended december in millions nonaccruing loans at december interest income that would have been recognized under original terms interest income actually received net interest margin the net interest margin measures the difference  or spread  between the yields we earn on earning assets and the rates we pay on interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin is affected by the magnitude of changes in market interest rates and the pace at which those changes occur 
in  our margin benefited from growth in core deposit balances  which lowered our funding costs because it reduced our need for national brokered cds and other non core funding 
in addition  we implemented interest rate minimums for new and renewing loans 
these positives  however  were unable to offset the effects of the near zero interest rate environment 
net interest margin for the year ended december net interest margin the primary pressures on the margin in and were the historically low level of market interest rates 
the target federal funds rate was stable at between june and august  a period of months 
then  in august  the federal open market committee fomc began to reduce rates 
by year end  the fomc had lowered the target federal funds rate to 
the fomc made seven more rate reductions in  ultimately setting the target rate at a range of to  a historic low 
the target rate remained at this level throughout this lowered our interest expense  but it also reduced our interest income 
the average yield on earning assets for fell to  a decrease of basis points from the average rate on the cost of funds decreased to  a decrease of basis points from consequently  our margin for declined basis points to 
our margin for did not reflect the full extent of the rate cuts  because three of the seven cuts the fomc made that year did not occur until the fourth quarter

the was and ccs businesses generate most of our noninterest income 
the regional banking business also generates non interest income in the form of service charges  loan fees  and other types of fees 
in addition  all of the revenue we receive from our investments in crm and rcm is noninterest income 
noninterest income also includes securities gains and losses

we completed one in april and one in october 
this expense growth was offset by revenue growth in ccs retirement services revenue 
higher federal deposit insurance corporation fdic premium expense 
our fdic insurance premium expense for was million  compared with million for and million for the increase reflected an industry wide increase in premiums  which the fdic instituted in january a revision in the methodology the fdic uses to calculate premiums 
a special assessment the fdic levied on all banks in the second quarter 
the growth in our deposit balances 
in november  the fdic issued a rule that required all insured depository institutions  with limited exceptions  to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of   and the fdic also adopted a uniform basis point increase in assessment rates that will take effect on january  in december  we paid million in prepaid risk based assessments  which included million related to the fourth quarter of that otherwise would have been payable in the first quarter of this amount is included in our deposit insurance expense for the remaining million in pre paid deposit insurance is included in other assets on our balance sheet as of december  staffing related expenses continued to represent our largest concentration of costs 
interest expense is our second largest expense item 
staffing related expenses were lower for than for  primarily because incentive and bonus expense was lower  as accrued amounts were adjusted to reflect actual and expected payments 
the number of staff members decreased 
most of this decrease resulted from attrition and the closure in march of our conduit services business 
we recorded an income tax benefit for that reflected reconciliations between our estimates of taxes due and amounts we actually paid

income taxes and tax rate for the year ended december dollars in millions pre tax loss income before noncontrolling interest income tax benefit expense effective tax rate income tax expense and the effective tax rate in changed from mainly because taxes we paid were lower than the estimated amounts we previously recorded  which reduced tax expense by approximately million 
changes in state rates provided a tax benefit of approximately million 
the expectation that more of a subsidiary s deferred state tax asset will be recognized in the future resulted in a valuation allowance reduction of approximately million 
approximately million of a deferred tax asset we wrote off in was restored  because of the decline in the uncertainty surrounding the deductibility of executive compensation as a result of our participation in the cpp 
approximately million of tax reserves was released  due to completion of tax audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations 
income tax expense and the effective tax rate in reflected an impairment charge for rcm  which generated a tax benefit of approximately million for the subsidiary that holds our investment in rcm 
the write off of approximately million of deferred tax assets related to executive compensation as a result of our participation in the cpp and the uncertainty surrounding the deductibility of that compensation 
part ii item continued operating results we reported a net loss for largely because of the otti securities losses we recorded during the year 
on an operating basis excluding losses on otti securities  we were profitable for the full year 
operating net income was million and operating earnings were per diluted common share 
except for the securities losses  the dynamics that affected operating results for the year were the same as the factors that affected reported results 
operating results for the year ended december in millions net loss income impairments applicable income tax benefit expense operating results operating per share results on a fully diluted basis per share loss income per share loss of impairments  after tax per share earnings applicable to operating results we believe our operating results demonstrate the core earnings potential inherent in our diversified business mix 
because we have the ccs and was businesses  we were able to absorb a million loan loss provision and still record an operating profit 
operating results do not conform with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but we believe that these non gaap measures provide a more relevant and comparative basis on which to measure ongoing business activities and evaluate our performance 
help investors and analysts develop more meaningful and accurate analyses of trends in our core business operations 
some limitations are inherent in presenting operating results 
while we believe these disclosures help investors understand the dynamics of the company  these disclosures may not offer relevant comparisons to the operating results of other companies 
other companies might use different measures and or calculate them differently 
we compensate for these limitations by providing a detailed reconciliation between gaap reported results and non gaap operating results 
the presentation of non gaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental information and not as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with gaap 
regional banking overview our regional banking business serves clients in the mid atlantic region 
we define this region as the state of delaware and the parts of pennsylvania  new jersey  and maryland that are within approximately miles of our wilmington headquarters 
we provide consumer banking services to  and gather most of our core deposits from  clients in delaware 
we have branch offices in delaware 
we make the public aware of our consumer banking products mainly through newspaper advertising and direct mail 
we provide commercial banking services to clients throughout the mid atlantic region  principally in areas adjacent to the i corridor between princeton  new jersey  and baltimore  maryland 
we target our commercial banking services to family owned or closely held businesses in this region with annual sales of up to million  and with whom we can develop long term banking and wealth management relationships 
in addition to our branch offices in delaware  we have five commercial banking offices in southeastern pennsylvania  two in new jersey  and two in maryland 
wilmington trust corporation form k the majority of our commercial loans are in amounts of million or less 
this reflects our focus on privately held and family owned business clients  and the loan amounts they tend to need 
in general  most of our commercial borrowers concentrate their banking relationships with us 
our commercial banking offices outside of delaware are primarily sales offices 
in these offices  commercial banking and was staff members work together in teams 
many of our commercial banking clients are also was clients 
we have no traditional bank branch offices outside of delaware 
because we offer commercial banking services in a four state region  but focus our consumer banking activities in just one most of our loans are commercial loans 
most of our core deposits are from clients in delaware 
our regional banking business benefits from a number of competitive advantages 
chief among these is our focus on long term client relationships  not transactions 
in addition  we are among a dwindling number of banks headquartered in the mid atlantic region  and we are one of only three delaware headquartered banks that offer services statewide 
we prefer to originate loans ourselves  rather than purchase loans from brokers or other banks 
in general  we do not pursue syndicated lending opportunities 
we consider average loan and deposit balances  rather than period end balances  to be the better indicator of trends in the regional banking business 
this is because average balances represent client activity over the longer term 
this is especially true of core deposit balances  which can be skewed by large short term deposits that corporate client services clients may make at the ends of reporting periods 
most of the income our regional banking business generates is net interest income 
regional banking also generates noninterest income in the form of loan and deposit service charges 
the mid atlantic economy our regional banking business is affected by economic conditions in the mid atlantic region 
the economy in this region is broadly diversified among the life sciences  financial services  pharmaceutical  government  health care  education  construction  manufacturing  retail  agriculture  military  and tourism industry sectors 
historically  this diversification has provided a degree of economic stability and helped the region withstand the effects of a downturn in any single sector 
the unemployment rate in both delaware and pennsylvania was in december  better than the us national average of  but economic conditions overall remained challenging  due to the protracted nature of the recession 
these conditions affected our loan balances and credit metrics in and for more information about this  read the rest of this regional banking discussion and the credit quality discussion in this report 
delaware s economy has benefited from population growth in recent years 
for the months ended july  the us census bureau ranked delaware as the th fastest growing state in  the th fastest growing in  and the th fastest growing in many residents have been attracted by delaware s real estate taxes  which are considerably lower than those of surrounding states  and lack of sales tax 
we expect the regional economy to benefit from the us military s base realignment and closure brac initiative 
part of this initiative will increase operations and add jobs at military bases in maryland 
one of these bases is aberdeen proving ground in harford county  maryland  which is midway between wilmington and baltimore 
harford county officials estimate brac will add  high paying jobs at the base and as many as  additional off base jobs over the next few years 
part ii item continued highlights in  the regional banking business experienced muted demand for new loans  strong growth in core deposit balances  and higher levels of nonperforming loans and loan charge offs

commercial mortgage loans the increase in commercial mortgage balances reflected financing opportunities with strong income producing properties in the mid atlantic region 
in addition  we saw increased demand for commercial mortgages as changes in the credit markets minimized the competitive advantages formerly held by specialty commercial mortgage lenders  and as some commercial mortgage lenders exited the business 
we typically do not offer the long term structures that historically were provided by traditional commercial mortgage lenders 
wilmington trust corporation form k at december  more than half of our commercial mortgage loans were for owner occupied properties 
approximately were for community shopping centers 
the rest were for a variety of other types of commercial and industrial properties 
approximately were for properties in delaware  with the majority in the northern part of the state

in general  commercial construction loans we made in were related to existing projects  not new projects 
one of the largest commercial construction loans we added in was for the refinancing of a successful strip shopping center in northern delaware 
most of the rest of the commercial construction loans we added in were for land acquisition and development  primarily for residential projects in delaware and southeastern pennsylvania

we also make residential mortgage loans  primarily to clients in delaware 
loans secured with investments are primarily loans to was clients  and they do not reflect trends in the regional banking business 
consumer lending most of the consumer loans we make are to clients in delaware  where we focus our consumer banking activities 
consumer loan balances were lower for than for on both an average balance and period end basis 
this was mainly due to a decline in indirect automobile loans 
indirect loans involve three parties merchants who extend credit to customers  borrowers who seek credit  and financial institutions like us that provide credit 
most of the indirect loans we make are for new and late model used cars 
we make these loans through automobile dealers in the mid atlantic region as an extension of the commercial banking relationships we have with them

our residential mortgage portfolio includes low income housing loans we originate or purchase as part of our compliance with the community reinvestment act cra 
we do not engage in subprime residential mortgage lending 
almost all of our residential mortgages are for properties in delaware 
most of the residential mortgages we originate are conventional  conforming first mortgage loans with fixed rates  typically with or year terms 
we use a third party provider to service our residential mortgage loans 
our residential mortgage balances do not correlate directly with our origination volumes 
this is because we sell most of the fixed rate residential mortgages we originate into the secondary market  instead of retaining them on our balance sheet 
this is one of our interest rate risk management strategies  which we describe in more detail in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  in this report

deposits we record two types of deposits core deposits  which are deposits from our clients 
most of our core deposits come from clients in delaware  where we focus our consumer banking activities 
changes in core deposit balances primarily reflect trends in the regional banking business 
non core deposits  which include national brokered cds and short term borrowings 
non core deposits are not associated with client activity  and changes in their balances do not reflect regional banking business trends 
we use non core deposits to augment core deposits to fund earning asset growth 
we discuss core deposits in this section 
for more information about our use of national brokered cds  read the capital resources discussion and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  in this report

noninterest bearing demand deposits savings deposits interest bearing demand deposits cds  local cds  total core deposits growth in interest bearing demand deposit  noninterest bearing demand deposit  and savings deposit balances significantly outpaced growth in cd balances 
we attributed this to client preference for savings instruments with flexible terms in an uncertain economic environment 
interest bearing demand deposits accounted for most of the growth in total core deposits 
regional banking and was clients accounted for most of this growth  which was spurred by client demand for the safety of insured funds amid economic uncertainty and financial market volatility

part ii item continued most of our core deposits continued to come from regional banking clients in delaware  but all three businesses contributed to the growth in core deposit balances 
we include balances of local cds in amounts of  or more local cds in core deposits because these cds reflect client deposits  not national  wholesale  or brokered deposits 
most local cds are from clients in the mid atlantic region  including commercial banking clients and local municipalities  which frequently use these cds to generate returns on their excess cash 
balances of these cds decreased in and  as clients opted for savings instruments with more flexible terms

corporate client services overview the corporate client services ccs business provides a variety of trustee  agency  investment management  and administrative services for investment bankers  corporate tax  finance  and legal executives  and other institutional clients who use capital markets financing structures 
seek to establish and maintain legal residency nexus for special purpose entities in preferred jurisdictions 
use independent trustees to hold retirement plan assets 
need investment and cash management services 
we do not own the assets or entities for which we serve as trustee or administrator  nor are any of these assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in addition in general  we do not make loans to ccs clients  and we have no credit exposure to capital markets transactions 
we do not issue  underwrite  set pricing  or establish valuations for the financing structures or entities we support 
we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements 
we do not offer high volume  back office processing services for capital markets transactions 
most of our ccs clients are multinational corporations and institutions  and we have ccs clients in countries 
in the united states  we have ccs offices in arizona  connecticut  delaware  michigan  minnesota  nevada  new jersey  new york  south carolina  and vermont 
in europe  we have ccs offices in the channel islands  dublin  frankfurt  london  luxembourg  and the netherlands 
in the caribbean  we have a ccs office in grand cayman 
we group our ccs services into three categories global corporate trust services 
this area of ccs provides a variety of services that support capital markets transactions and entity management activities 
the legal documents that govern each financing structure  entity  and trust determine which services we provide 
these services include indenture  successor  collateral  and liquidating trustee and administrative services for corporate debt issuance and debt restructuring  reorganizations  mergers  and bankruptcies 
owner trustee  indenture trustee  and administrative services for securitizations and other structured finance transactions  and for capital equipment and project financing transactions 
successor loan agency services 
services that fulfill legal residency requirements for special purpose entities  such as providing independent directors and corporate governance  regulatory reporting  tax and accounting services  captive insurance company management  office management  and other administrative services 
wilmington trust corporation form k retirement services 
we provide trust  custody  accounting  benefit payment  collective investment fund administration  and investment management services for retirement plans 
we do not provide record keeping services 
a typical qualified us retirement plan uses an investment manager  a record keeper  and a trustee 
when a plan sponsor uses a single provider to perform all three functions  the plan is considered bundled 
when a plan sponsor uses separate providers for each function  the plan is unbundled 
we specialize in serving unbundled plans  and we work with leading record keepers and third party administrators to market our services 
institutional investment and cash management services 
our institutional investment and cash management services help clients increase their returns on fixed income investments and residual cash 
commodity funds  community banks  and clients who use construction fund  escrow agent  and other services may place large sums of cash with us for periods that range from as little as hours to as long as several years 
our primary competitive advantage in this business is the fact that we are an independent  conflict free service provider 
we typically do not lend to ccs clients  so we typically have no lending conflicts of interest 
since we are not an investment bank  we have no securities underwriting conflicts of interest 
how we report ccs revenue we report ccs revenue in three categories global corporate trust services revenue 
fees for these services are based on the complexity and duration of the services we provide  not on asset valuations 
we perform most of these services under multiyear contracts 
in december  we combined the formerly separate capital markets and entity management revenue lines into a single category called global corporate trust services 
we have adjusted amounts presented in this report to reflect this change 
retirement services revenue 
a portion of this revenue is based on the market valuations of retirement plan assets and collective funds for which we are trustee 
the remainder is based on the level of service we provide 
investment and cash management services revenue 
this revenue is based on money market fund balances and the market valuations of investment grade fixed income instruments 
almost all ccs revenue is noninterest income 
ccs generates some net interest income from deposit taking and cash management services 
we do not attribute any portion of the provision for loan losses to ccs  because we typically do not lend to ccs clients 
for more information about this  read note  segment reporting  in this report 
highlights ccs set new sales and revenue records in revenue for was million higher than for most of this growth came from retirement services  which contributed million of the increase  and global corporate trust services  which contributed million 
the increase in retirement services revenue resulted from the two acquisitions we made in to increase our capacity and potential for growth in this business 
since we completed one of these acquisitions in april and the other in october  our revenue did not reflect a full months of revenue from these acquisitions

global corporate trust services retirement services investment cash management services total corporate client services revenue part ii item continued the growth in global corporate trust revenue far exceeded our expectations  especially considering the lack of activity in the capital markets overall 
this growth demonstrated the advantages of being an independent provider with no lending or investment banking conflicts of interest 
many clients prefer service providers that do not have these types of conflicts 
how effectively ccs has been able to respond quickly to changing market needs 
while the market for services that support asset backed securitizations and other traditional financing structures remained at a near standstill  demand rose for successor loan agency  bankruptcy  and other types of services 
how staff members we have added over the past months have generated more business 
for example  we hired a team of seasoned capital markets experts in minneapolis in this group has helped us garner additional successor loan agency  bankruptcy related  and distressed debt business 
in  we hired a team of new york based professionals to support global expansion of our project finance services 
how ccs is benefiting from industry consolidation 
in february  bank of america  na selected us to assume some of the corporate debt trustee services formerly performed by lasalle bank na  which bank of america acquired in this transfer did not affect bank of america s larger securitization trustee business  lasalle global trust services 
in july  we hired a team of former lasalle corporate trust professionals who specialize in trust administration for insurance products 
we are serving as successor trustee  serving on the creditors committee  and or providing other services for most of the largest us bankruptcies filed in  including lehman brothers  general motors  lyondellbasell industries  general growth properties  capmark financial group  citadel broadcasting corporation  and others 
we continued to win institutional and cash management mandates in fees tied to us investment grade fixed income securities accounted for approximately of institutional investment and cash management revenue for  up from approximately for ccs assets under management increased in  mainly because of the additional investment management mandates 
the growth in ccs assets under administration reflected additional retirement services business  increases in retirement plan asset valuations  and contributions from plan participants

wealth advisory services overview the wealth advisory services was business helps high net worth clients grow their wealth  protect it  and transfer it to their heirs 
we target our services to clients with liquid assets of million or more 
we have was clients throughout the united states and other countries  and our client relationships often span multiple generations 
we have was offices in california  connecticut  delaware  florida  georgia  maryland  massachusetts  new jersey  new york  and pennsylvania 
wilmington trust corporation form k we offer a comprehensive array of wealth management services  including complete asset management sm 
to our clients  managing risk is as important as increasing return 
our investment advisory firm  wilmington trust investment management  helps clients meet both objectives by focusing on portfolio construction  not stock picking  and by emphasizing diversification 
applying forward looking asset allocation 
performing strategic and tactical rebalancing 
employing a blend of active and passive funds 
we use an open architecture approach to implement our asset allocation strategies 
this means we use a mix of proprietary and third party investment managers

for other asset classes and styles  we use independent investment managers 
fiduciary services 
trust and estate attorneys and tax advisors throughout the united states regard us as a premier provider of fiduciary services  which include trust management  trust administration  philanthropic services  estate settlement  and a variety of financial  retirement  and succession planning services 
we specialize in helping clients employ the favorable trust laws in delaware  which is considered the leading trust jurisdiction in the united states 
many of the legal and tax advantages available for trusts domiciled in delaware are not available in other states 
family office services 
we help family office clients identify  review  consolidate  and execute financial and lifestyle management needs 
we specialize in the unique needs of these clients  including family office legal structures

compensation strategies for corporate executives 
the family office services we provide include planning and governance  cash flow management and budgeting  tax planning and compliance  real estate acquisition and disposition  risk assessment and insurance oversight  bill payment and payroll management  family security  and other services 
many  but not all  of our family office clients also use our asset management services 
each was client has a relationship manager who coordinates a team of specialists 
these specialists may include investment advisors  planning professionals  fiduciary advisors  tax professionals  and trust administrators  depending on each client s individual needs 
how we report was revenue we report was revenue in three categories trust and investment advisory revenue 
this category consists of fees for asset management  asset allocation  and trust management services 
these fees are based on the market valuations of assets we manage  direct  or hold in custody for clients 
these fees are affected by movements in financial markets such as the dow jones industrial average  the standard poor s s p  nasdaq  and others 
changes in trust and investment advisory revenue may or may not correlate directly with financial market movements  depending on the mix of assets in client accounts 
we use the s p as a benchmark for comparison because its composition mirrors  to a large extent  the mix of equities in our clients portfolios 
for more information about the mix of instruments in client portfolios  read the assets under management discussion in this report 
planning and other services revenue 
this category consists of fees from family office  financial planning  estate settlement  tax  and other services 
these fees are based on the level and complexity of the services we provide  regardless of the value of any associated assets 
in some cases  these fees are based on the client s annual income 
these fees can vary widely in amount  and portions may be nonrecurring 
it is not unusual for revenue from these services to fluctuate from one reporting period to another 
when family office clients use our asset management services  the associated fees are based on market valuations and recorded as trust and investment advisory revenue 
mutual fund revenue 
most of our mutual fund fees are tied to money market mutual funds and cash balances 
consequently  equity market movements typically have little  if any  effect on this category of revenue 
the majority of was revenue is noninterest income 
was also generates net interest income from private banking and custom lending services  and we attribute a portion of the provision for loan losses to was 
for more information about this  read note  segment reporting  in this report 
part ii item continued we believe that changes in revenue  rather than changes in managed asset levels  are the better indicator of trends in the was business 
for more information about this  read the assets under management discussion in this report 
highlights was business development was solid throughout  from new and existing clients  but these new business gains could not counter market pressures that reduced revenue 
total was revenue was lower for than for  with trust and investment advisory revenue and mutual fund revenue accounting for most of the decrease 
was revenue change change for the year ended december dollars in millions vs 
vs 
trust and investment advisory fees planning and other services fees mutual fund fees total wealth advisory services revenue two factors caused the decrease in trust and investment advisory revenue the decline of client asset valuations and a shift in client investment preferences 
volatility in the financial markets drove asset valuations lower throughout and most of as noted earlier  we base our fees for trust and investment advisory services on asset valuations 
when those valuations decrease  there is a corresponding decrease in the associated fees 
the decline in asset valuations caused many was clients to reexamine their risk tolerance and liquidity needs 
many of these clients reduced their exposure to equities  weighted their portfolios more heavily toward fixed income investments  and increased their cash positions 
the federal deposit insurance corporation s increase in deposit coverage further enhanced the appeal of cash 
even though equity markets improved during the fourth quarter  many clients opted to remain on the sidelines 
these dynamics reduced trust and investment advisory revenue because  in general  the pricing on our fixed income and cash management services is lower than our pricing on equity investment management services 
mutual fund revenue was affected negatively in by the low level of market interest rates 
as yields on our money market mutual funds fell  we began to waive our management fees on these funds 
these waivers reduced was revenue by approximately million 
the decline in revenue from planning and other services reflected the fluctuations in demand that are inherent in this business 
was added billion of client assets in most of this increase was in assets under administration  and more than half was associated with a family wealth client relationship

wilmington trust corporation form k the increase in the percentage of was sales from markets outside of the mid atlantic region illustrated the success we are having in the newer markets in which we have invested in recent years 
although we added clients in  the dollar amount of sales declined  due to lower market valuations and the preference for fixed income and cash investment services

for information about was profitability  read note  segment reporting  in this report 
assets under management and administration we report two types of client assets assets under management aum 
these are assets for which we make investment decisions on behalf of clients 
most of our aum are associated with was clients 
assets under administration aua 
these are assets we hold in custody  or for which we serve as fiduciary  on behalf of clients 
most of our aua are associated with ccs retirement services clients 
changes in our aum or aua levels do not necessarily reflect new or lost business  nor do they always correlate with financial market movements 
this is because most of the assets we manage or administer for clients are held in trusts 
trust asset levels can be decreased by fund distributions for tax payments  philanthropic obligations  discretionary spending  trust terminations  and other purposes 
asset levels also are affected by the duration of trust agreements  which can range from a few months to years or more 
we believe that changes in revenue  rather than changes in aum or aua levels  are better indicators of trends in the was and ccs businesses  because the pricing on many of our services is not based on asset valuations 
was and ccs revenue may include fees for direction trust services  but direction trust assets are not included in our aum amounts 
direction trusts  which are permitted in delaware  allow clients to have their assets and fiduciary matters managed separately and by different providers 
trust laws in many other states do not permit direction trusts 
monetary assets we manage or administer for ccs clients can fluctuate by hundreds of millions of dollars from one reporting period to the next  depending on the cash management needs of these clients

while equity market valuations increased  many clients continued to prefer fixed income investments 
affiliate money managers in addition to our own investment management activities  we have ownership positions in two money management firms cramer rosenthal mcglynn crm  a value style manager based in new york 
crm targets institutional clients 
roxbury capital management rcm  a growth style manager based in minneapolis  minnesota 
rcm targets institutional and high net worth clients 
crm and rcm are not part of our was business  and their managers and employees are not wilmington trust staff members 
we affiliated with crm and rcm in to gain expertise in stylized investment management and to help us establish offices in new york and southern california 
we subsequently adopted an investment consulting process that uses a variety of independent  third party money managers 
although we no longer rely as heavily on crm and rcm for investment management services  we value their contributions to our revenue 
wilmington trust corporation form k affiliate money manager revenue for the year ended december in millions total revenue from affiliate money managers net of expenses the revenue we record from crm and rcm is net of their expenses and based on our ownership position in each 
in contrast to aum at wilmington trust  changes in aum at crm and rcm reflect business flows as well as financial market movements 
for more information about our investments in crm and rcm  read note  affiliates and acquisitions  and note  segment reporting  in this report 
at crm  managed assets rose steadily throughout  due to business inflows and improvements in equity market valuations  especially during the second half of the year 
crm s managed assets at year end were higher than at year end revenue from crm for was higher than for the pace of growth in revenue did not match the pace of growth in aum  mainly because market conditions reduced the performance fees crm earns on its real estate hedge fund investments 
crm results as of and for the year ended december in millions assets under management revenue net of expenses rcm s newer small and mid cap products gained traction in and attracted new investments 
this new business  plus improved equity market valuations  resulted in managed asset levels that were higher at year end than at year end revenue from this growth was not strong enough to offset expenses  however  and we recorded a net loss from rcm for rcm relocated its headquarters from santa monica  california  to minnesota in  which is just one example of the steps rcm is taking to reduce expenses and improve profitability

capital resources we manage capital to meet or exceed appropriate standards of financial safety and soundness  comply with existing and impending regulatory requirements  and provide for future growth 
we review our capital position and make adjustments as needed to ensure we can achieve these objectives 
our wholly owned bank subsidiaries are the main users of our capital  and they are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
the ccs and was businesses are not as capital intensive 
neither ccs nor was is subject to regulatory capital requirements  although some of our trust agreements specify capital requirements 
the federal reserve has established minimum capital requirements that provide a context for measuring a bank s capital position and the varying degrees of risk associated with different on and off balance sheet items 
these requirements are expressed as ratios

part ii item continued our capital position remained strong in and  but the net losses we recorded for both years translated into decreases in average common stockholders equity and the average equity to average assets ratio

our capital ratios have exceeded those minimums every year since they were established in  and was no exception 
at december  our capital included million of wilmington trust series a preferred stock and common stock warrants  which we sold to the us department of the treasury under the capital purchase program cpp in december for more information about our participation in the cpp  read note  capital  in this report 
all of our regulatory capital ratios were higher than at december  all of our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the amounts required by the federal reserve to be considered a well capitalized institution  both including and excluding the million in cpp funds

we believe this information is useful  and we include it here to provide a more complete picture of our capital position 
regulatory capital ratios federal reserve federal reserve minimum to minimum to be adequately be well at at capitalized capitalized total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital our capital ratios improved in mainly because we reduced the amount of capital paid out for the quarterly cash dividend 
commercial and retail loan balances declined 
we decreased our investment securities portfolio balances 
tangible common equity one of the tools we use to measure the adequacy of our capital is the tangible common equity to assets tce ratio 
our tce ratio at december   was  up from at year end the tce ratio improved because the decline in assets was greater than the decline in equity 
wilmington trust corporation form k the tce ratio is a non gaap disclosure 
we believe it is a useful tool because it reflects the level of capital we have available to withstand unexpected market conditions 
in addition  it is a measure that credit rating agencies and industry analysts use to evaluate our financial condition and capital strength 
because the tce ratio is a non gaap disclosure  some limitations are inherent in its use 
it may not offer a relevant comparison to other companies 
in addition  other companies might calculate their tce ratios differently 
consequently  the tce ratio should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for stockholders equity  total assets  or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap

the changes we made to our common stock cash dividend in reduced our quarterly capital payout for cash dividends from approximately million per quarter to approximately  per quarter  as shown in the table below 
quarterly cash dividend approximate capital payout per common share approximately million per quarter per common share approximately million per quarter per common share approximately  per quarter based on common shares outstanding at december  part ii item continued we believe that paying a lower cash dividend will help us increase capital at a faster pace and hasten our exit from the cpp 
we also expect capital to increase as the economy stabilizes and credit pressures ease  which should enable us to reduce the provision for loan losses  increase net income  and add capital through retained earnings 
the us government has placed some dividend restrictions on banks that participate in the cpp

shelf registration from time to time  we may choose to issue equity or debt securities to raise capital for general corporate or other purposes 
a variety of factors  including financial market conditions  could influence the timing of any such issues 
in order to have the most flexibility to make these issues under securities registration requirements  we filed a shelf registration form s with the sec on november   and post effective amendments to that registration statement on september   and january  pursuant to rule of the securities act of  we have until november   in which to issue any such securities 
we have agreed with our regulators that we will not incur any debt  subject to certain exceptions  and that wilmington trust company will not incur any debt with a maturity of greater than one year  in each case without prior written approval from our regulators 
liquidity and funding as a bank holding company  we need funding and liquidity to support operating and investing activities  comply with regulatory requirements  and minimize the risk of having insufficient funds to conduct business 
we believe our liquidity position is strong because our capital ratios demonstrate that we are well capitalized 
we have access to diverse sources of funding  which mitigates our liquidity risk and gives us the ability to adjust the mix and amount of funding as we deem appropriate 
our liquidity management practices give us the flexibility to react to changes that might affect our liquidity adversely 
to manage the risk of having insufficient liquidity  we monitor our existing and projected liquidity requirements continually 
follow policies in the liquidity funding plan approved by our board of directors 
calculate a wholesale funding coverage ratio monthly using three  six  and month time horizons 
identify our exposure to volatile liabilities and calculate liquid asset coverage ratios 
monitor cash flows 
in addition  we maintain a contingency funding plan cfp 
the cfp articulates various internal and external scenarios that could create or exacerbate liquidity risk  outlines potential outcomes in each scenario  and specifies strategies to employ in response 
we use the guidelines in the cfp to stress test our liquidity position in a normal operating scenario  a moderately disruptive scenario  a severely disruptive scenario  and a crisis scenario 
response strategies in the cfp identify alternative funding sources and our borrowing capacities for each 
the plan allows for adjusting the borrowing capacities  depending on the stress scenario and the funding source 
our funding strategy is to use a blend of core and non core funding that consists primarily of core deposits  which are deposits made by clients 
national brokered cds  which we gather through various broker networks  and which typically consist of deposits from individuals  mutual funds  or financial institutions 
at december   most of the underlying deposits in our national brokered cds were from individual depositors

risk the normal course of business exposes us to a variety of operational  reputational  legal  and regulatory risks  which we monitor closely to safeguard our clients assets and our company s assets 
our primary risks are credit risk the risk that borrowers might be unable to repay their loans  which could increase loan losses  increase the provision for loan losses  and reduce net interest income 
interest rate risk the risk that fluctuations in market interest rates could decrease the profitability of loans or investment securities  compress the net interest margin  and reduce net interest income 
financial market risk the risk that volatility in the financial markets might reduce the market valuations of assets in client portfolios  which could decrease fee income 
our investment securities portfolio  which could require us to record securities losses 
economic risk the risk that economic conditions might affect our ability to conduct business 
all of these risks could affect our financial performance and condition adversely 
we believe our exposure to these risks is mitigated by our business mix  which provides geographic  product  and client diversification 
produces two balanced and diversified sources of revenue net interest income  primarily from our regional banking business 
noninterest income  primarily from our corporate client services and wealth advisory services businesses

the discussion of asset quality and credit risk below 
wilmington trust corporation form k asset quality asset quality is a measure of the risk associated with loans  investment securities  and other assets on our balance sheet 
asset quality affects cash flows  capital  income  expenses  and  ultimately  our profitability 
our principal assets are loans  securities we hold in our investment portfolio  and the goodwill we record in conjunction with acquisitions and our investments in the affiliate money managers 
at year end  net loans accounted for of our assets  investment securities accounted for of our assets  and other types of assets accounted for the remaining 
most of our asset risk remained tied to credit lending risk 
the two main factors that affected our asset quality in were higher levels of problem loans  which we discuss in more detail in the credit risk section below 
declines in the market values of some of the instruments in our investment securities portfolio 
for more information about this  read note  investment securities  in this report 
credit risk lending money is inherently risky 
when we make a loan  we make subjective judgments about the borrower s ability to meet the loan s terms and conditions 
no matter how financially sound a client or lending decision may seem  the borrower s ability to repay can be affected adversely by economic changes and other external factors 
in addition  we make objective and subjective valuation assessments on assets we finance 
in most cases  these assets secure loans we make 
over time  changes in market conditions can affect these valuations  either positively or negatively 
how we mitigate credit risk to mitigate credit risk  we employ rigorous loan underwriting standards and apply them consistently 
prefer to grow loan balances ourselves  using our own underwriting standards  instead of purchasing loans or acquiring other banks 
make the majority of our loans within regional banking s mid atlantic geographic footprint  in markets we know well 
focus on building long term relationships with clients  instead of merely increasing transaction volumes 
typically obtain collateral and personal guarantees from commercial borrowers 
monitor the loan portfolio to identify potential problems 
regularly review all past due loans  loans not being repaid according to contractual terms  and loans we doubt will be paid on a timely basis 
perform an internal risk rating analysis that classifies all loans outstanding into one of four categories of risk 
we apply these classifications consistently and we analyze migrations within the classifications quarterly 
this system has helped us develop adequate loan loss reserves for many years 
the four risk categories are pass loans with no current or potential problems 
watchlist accruing loans that are potentially problematic 
substandard accruing or nonaccruing loans with identified weaknesses and some probability of loss 
doubtful loss nonaccruing loans with a high probability of loss  or which we have charged off 
in addition  we divide credit risk related responsibilities among different groups of staff members  including lending  loan recovery  credit policy and administration  appraisal  and credit review staff members 
these groups have different reporting relationships the lending group is part of our regional banking business  and its reporting relationships follow the regional banking organizational structure 
the credit policy and administration group reports directly to our chairman and chief executive officer 
loan recovery and appraisal staff members are part of this group 
the credit review group functions independently  and reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors 
part ii item continued appraisal staff members determine whether revaluations should be performed by staff members or third party appraisers  unless the property secures a loan which has been determined to be impaired under asc  receivables  which requires that revaluations be performed by third party appraisers 
our appraisal staff members review all appraisals performed by third party professionals 
the credit review group provides a variety of analyses designed to help us understand the condition of the loan portfolio 
this group performs analyses of the portfolio by type of loan  geographic exposure  and individual lender 
annual reviews of a minimum percentage of the portfolio 
assessments of the accuracy of internal risk ratings within specific portfolio segments 
assessments of the adequacy of monitoring and administration for specific portfolio segments 
reviews of our largest credit exposures 
we believe our approach gives us a system of checks and balances that enhances our ability to evaluate credit risk 
how we identify potential problem loans to identify potential problem loans  we review payment performance on an ongoing basis 
analyze account overdrafts 
monitor compliance with established loan covenants or collateral formulas 
perform targeted reviews and analyses of loans by type  size  and borrower 
for consumer and residential mortgage loans  we identify problems primarily by reviewing payment performance 
we do not assign risk ratings to loans in these portfolios 
for commercial loans and loans secured with investments  the process is more complex  and it involves a high degree of management review and judgment 
every commercial loan and loan secured with investments receives an initial risk rating that is assigned by the client relationship manager 
it is the client relationship manager s responsibility to identify deterioration in the quality of a loan  as soon as such conditions are known or suspected  by changing the loan s assigned risk rating 
the independent credit review group examines and confirms these risk ratings to ensure that they accurately reflect the risk profile of the portfolio 
for each significant potential problem loan in the commercial and secured with investments portfolios  the client relationship manager prepares a written summary that contains information about the borrower s financial performance  payment history  and collateral position  as well as an action plan for managing the credit 
these summaries are reviewed and discussed by lending staff members in each of our regional banking markets at quarterly loan quality meetings 
depending on a credit s risk profile  regional banking managers may ask loan recovery staff members to consult on  or assume responsibility  for managing it 
when we downgrade a loan to a substandard rating  we require loan recovery staff members  at a minimum  to consult on it 
when a substandard loan s risk profile deteriorates  or when the risk rating is lower than substandard  we transfer the client relationship from the lending unit to our loan recovery unit 
exceptions to this policy must be approved by the manager of the division in which the loan resides and by the loan recovery group 
we conduct quarterly credit strategies meetings to review significant relationships with ratings that are substandard or lower  or other credits that demonstrate rapid and or severe deterioration and a high probability of income and or principal loss 
among the issues we analyze and review at these meetings are collection strategies  plans to improve performance  and levels of available collateral support 
members of senior management attend these meetings 
wilmington trust corporation form k how we manage problem loans when a loan becomes or more days past due  we consider that a sign of a possible problem  and we increase our monitoring of the loan in an effort to prevent more severe delinquency 
when a loan becomes or more days past due  or if it has been identified as a potential problem loan  we may take one or more of the following steps confirm the loan s assigned risk rating 
review our collateral position and valuations 
allocate an appropriate amount to the reserve for loan losses 
transfer all or part of the loan relationship to nonaccruing status 
renegotiate all or part of the loan s terms 
foreclose on real property or accept a deed to real property in lieu of foreclosure  and record the property s value as other real estate owned oreo 
charge off all or part of the loan 
when we transfer a loan to nonaccruing status  we allocate a specific  associated amount to the reserve for loan losses  in accordance with asc  which incorporated sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we base most of these allocations on the underlying value of the collateral supporting the loan 
we also may consider the net present value of the loan s future cash flows and or the observed market price of the loan 
we update our reserve allocations quarterly 
if necessary  we adjust the reserve by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses 
for more information about how we establish the reserve  read the loan loss reserve and loan loss provision section  note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  reserve for loan losses  in this report 
loan recovery and credit review staff members analyze all problem credits on a quarterly basis to determine collection potential and identify collateral deficiencies 
if a collateral shortfall exists  we typically revise the loan s structure by requiring additional principal payments  additional collateral  or additional support in the form of other guaranties  to the extent that the loan s documentation permits such remedies 
if there is a collateral or cash flow shortfall on an impaired loan  we record a specific reserve for loan losses in accordance with asc loan recovery and credit review staff members use the quarterly analyses of collection potential and collateral deficiencies as a basis for recommending whether a loan should be charged off partially or fully 
we record charge offs when both of the following conditions are present it is probable that we will not be able to collect the full amount of the loan s principal 
we can measure the amount of loss reliably 
if both of these conditions are not met  we maintain the estimated loss exposure as a specific allocation in the reserve for loan losses 
when we transfer a property to oreo through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  we analyze the property s value to determine if a charge off is necessary to bring the loan to the fair value of the property  less cost to sell  at the time we take possession 
how we determine collateral valuations for problem credits secured with real estate our lenders obtain updated valuations  regardless of loan size  any time they believe there has been an obvious and material deterioration in market conditions  project performance  or physical aspects of the property itself that could jeopardize our collateral position 
we assess the need for revaluation when the amount of the loan is  or more and one or more of the following conditions exists the client relationship manager recommends we renew or extend the loan 
the loan is downgraded to a risk rating of substandard or lower 
the loan has had a watchlist rating for months 
part ii item continued appraisal staff members collect and analyze data that we use to determine the reliability of appraisals 
these data include internal and external reports on trends in real estate valuation  appreciation and depreciation  absorption rates  lease rates  occupancy rates  capitalization rates  and information we obtain from appraisal reviews and conversations with third party appraisers and other market participants 
we assess real estate market changes on a quarterly basis in meetings led by staff members who maintain their member  appraisal institute mai credentials 
the mai is the highest professional designation a commercial property appraiser can achieve 
if the data we collect indicate it is probable that the value of a particular property type remained stable or appreciated over the time period under consideration  we do not require a new appraisal 
if the data indicate probable deterioration in value  we require a new appraisal 
appraisal staff members review the valuations of substandard loans secured with real estate annually 
if we determine that the most recent appraisal no longer represents the fair value for a property  we obtain a new appraisal or evaluation to substantiate the property s value 
key credit risk metrics the key measures we use to evaluate our exposure to credit risk are the internal risk rating classifications  levels of loans past due days or more  levels of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  the net charge off ratio  the reserve for loan losses  and the provision for loan losses 
we believe the most relevant measure of credit quality is the net charge off ratio  which expresses loan charge offs minus loan recoveries as a percentage of total loans outstanding 
we believe this ratio offers a better basis for analyzing our credit quality than nonaccruing loan amounts  because we do not automatically charge off nonaccruing loans after a certain amount of time elapses  unless the loan is collateral dependent as defined by asc if we believe it is likely that the loan can return to performing status  we prefer to work with the borrower to resolve payment problems 
charge off dollar amounts  because increases or decreases in net charge off dollar amounts may not correspond directly to increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances 
other measures of credit quality  because they do not convey the nature of our client relationships or our pursuit of repayment even after we classify loans as nonaccruing or charge them off 
historically  compared to many other banks  our nonperforming asset levels have been higher  but our net charge offs have been lower 
this is because we prefer to work with borrowers to resolve repayment problems 
this includes renegotiating loan terms and conditions  and exploring other repayment options 
many borrowers with nonperforming loans continue to operate their businesses  and we believe it is likely that many of these loans will return to performing status within a timeframe that is acceptable to us 
when necessary  we believe that moving properties to oreo is a positive step in the loan work out process  because we gain control of the situation 
legal expenses associated with collection efforts cease 
we gain the ability to facilitate disposition of these properties and recover our cash 
we can then redeploy that cash into loans or other earning assets 
in our commercial portfolio  charge offs are very unpredictable  because negotiations with borrowers can affect the timing and extent of charge offs  or avert them altogether 
associated legal proceedings can affect the timing and amount of charge offs or recoveries 
in our residential mortgage portfolio  charge offs are practically nonexistent  because we sell most of our newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages into the secondary market 
we do not make subprime  alt a  or any other so called exotic residential mortgage loans 
wilmington trust corporation form k even after we charge loans off  we continue to pursue repayment 
when we receive repayments on charged off loans  we record them as loan recoveries 
on a percentage basis  the composition of the loan portfolio remained well diversified

credit quality in and the economy in was slow to rebound from the sharp decline in activity that occurred late in some pockets of stability were evident as progressed  but conditions remained uneven 
in particular  the mid atlantic region  where our regional banking business is focused  generally has fared better than other parts of the united states  but it has not been immune to the effects of the economic downturn 
in  the protracted nature of this recession pressured borrowers and led to an increase in the number of troubled credits 
the effect of the economy s extended weakness was evident in our credit metrics 
compared to  the percentage of credits with pass ratings declined 
in addition  levels of nonperforming assets and net charge offs increased  while loans past due days or more declined modestly 
commercial construction loans accounted for approximately of the increase in troubled credits 
we believe the increase in troubled credits resulted primarily from economic pressures 
conversely  favorable economic conditions in and were the main reason for the comparatively low levels of net charge offs and the net charge off ratio for those years

restructured loans 
these are loans for which we and the borrower have renegotiated terms or conditions 
oreo  which consists of properties we acquire through foreclosure or when the borrower defaults 
we record these properties at their fair value  less cost to sell 
seven commercial loan relationships accounted for a majority of the increase in non performing loans 
all were real estate related  most were located in delaware  and they included a delaware developer of income producing retail properties 
a mid atlantic based retirement community developer

a single and multi family residential project in central delaware that we took possession of in the second quarter 
a single family residential project that we took possession of in the fourth quarter 
an investment property in maryland that we took possession of in the fourth quarter 
the other major components of oreo were an income producing hotel and retail property in ocean city  maryland  and a luxury home development in montgomery county  pennsylvania 
our foreclosures on both of these properties occurred in the second quarter of we also sold numerous properties in  which reduced oreo by more than million 
we expect oreo to continue to increase in  as our efforts to resolve problems with borrowers may involve foreclosures 
net charge offs the effect of the weak economy on our borrowers led to increases in net charge offs  the provision for loan losses  and the reserve for loans losses 
net charge offs rose to million  while the net charge off ratio increased to from in commercial construction loans accounted for most of the increase 
serious doubt loans serious doubt loans are loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms  or were fewer than days past due  at the time of classification  but which we think have the potential to become nonperforming loans in the future 
most of our serious doubt loans are commercial construction loans and commercial  financial  and agricultural loans 
a number of the commercial  financial  and agricultural loans are to providers of products and services to the construction industry 
many of the serious doubt loans at year end were moved to nonaccruing status in  which is why the amount of serious doubt loans was lower at year end serious doubt loans at december dollars in millions commercial  financial  and agricultural loans commercial real estate construction loans commercial mortgage loans consumer and other retail loans contingency allocation total serious doubt loans ratio of serious doubt loans to total loans outstanding loan loss reserve and loan loss provision the reserve and provision for loan losses increased in primarily because of deterioration in the quality of the commercial real estate construction portfolio

in assessing these risks  we make subjective judgments about the likelihood that loans will be repaid and unpaid amounts we might be able to recover 
we also consider loan growth  the results of the internal risk rating analysis  the levels of loan recoveries and repayments  the stability of the mid atlantic regional economy  market interest rates  regulatory guidelines  and other factors 
we believe our process provides the best estimate of required reserves at each reporting date 
the process we use to calculate the reserve has provided an appropriate reserve over an extended period of time  and we believe that our methodology is sound 
the reserve and provision for loan losses do not necessarily increase in conjunction with loan growth  because newly added loans do not automatically carry the same or a higher degree of risk than loans already in the portfolio 
determining the reserve is an inherently subjective process 
estimates we make  including estimates of the amounts and timing of payments we expect to receive on impaired loans  may be susceptible to significant change 
if actual circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used to determine the reserve  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary 
this could have a material effect on our financial performance and condition

commercial real estate industry exposure our exposure to the commercial real estate industry is concentrated within our regional banking footprint the mid atlantic region 
we make construction and commercial mortgage loans to clients whose businesses are headquartered in this region and whose projects are located in this region 
most of our construction loans are for single family homes in delaware and southeastern pennsylvania 
our commercial real estate borrowers are well established businesses that are family owned or closely held 
we do not lend to large  national homebuilders 
we do very little condominium construction or conversion financing 
in addition to the collateral provided by the project itself  we generally obtain personal guarantees from commercial real estate borrowers 
before extending credit  we conduct separate evaluations of the project s finances and the borrower s finances 
stress test the project s estimated cash flows in a variety of economic scenarios  including changes in absorption rates and financing costs 
the growth in our commercial real estate related loan balances in recent years has coincided with a period of tremendous expansion in our commercial lending activities in southeastern pennsylvania  new jersey  and maryland 
population growth in the region  primarily in southern delaware 
wilmington trust corporation form k commercial construction loan underwriting standards maximum term two years on unimproved land three years on land development target loan size million to million maximum loan to value ltv requirements on unimproved land on land development for lots the borrower plans to sell to a third party on land development for lots to be built out by the borrower on residential construction and income producing properties on special purpose income producing properties eg  self storage facilities  hotels  etc

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the normal course of business exposes us to a variety of operational  reputational  legal  and regulatory risks  which we monitor closely to safeguard our clients assets and our company s assets 
all of these risks could affect our financial performance and condition adversely 
our primary risks are credit risk  interest rate risk  financial market risk  and economic risk 
for more information about credit risk  read the asset quality and credit risk discussions in this report 
market interest rates present more risk to us than inflation 
as a financial institution  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
their values are more likely to be eroded by changes in market interest rates than by the effects of inflation on currency valuations 
interest rate risk changes in market interest rates  and the pace at which they occur  can affect the yields we earn on loans and investments and the rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
these changes can compress our net interest margin and reduce net interest income 
we have more floating rate assets than floating rate liabilities  and our interest rate risk position is asset sensitive 
in general  this means that in a rising market interest rate environment  our net interest income is more likely to increase 
in a declining market interest rate environment  our net interest income is more likely to decrease 
when market interest rates change  our floating rate assets reprice more quickly than our deposits  because the pricing adjusts on most of our floating rate loans within to days of a rate change 
the rates on noninterest bearing demand deposits do not adjust with market rate changes 
certificates of deposit have fixed rates and typically take more than six months to mature 
our interest rate risk management objective is to minimize reductions in net interest income that might result from changes in market interest rates 
to mitigate interest rate risk  we maintain a mix of assets and liabilities that gives us flexibility in a dynamic marketplace 
manage the relative proportion of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities so we can manage their repricing characteristics as closely as possible 
manage the size of our investment securities portfolio and the mix of instruments in it

sell most newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages into the secondary market 
by limiting the fixed rate residential mortgages in our loan portfolio  we eliminate much of the long term risk inherent in holding instruments with fixed rates and to year maturities

the mortgage backed instruments in our investment securities portfolio typically have shorter maturity and duration characteristics than a portfolio of individual mortgage loans 
use derivative instruments 
for more information about this  read the discussion of off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and note  derivative and hedging activities  in this report 
to achieve our interest rate risk management objective  we follow guidelines set by an asset liability management policy that is approved annually by our board of directors 
under the current policy  our objective is to limit any reduction in net interest income from changes in market interest rates to less than in any month period 
the primary tool we use to assess our exposure to interest rate risk is a computer modeling technique that simulates how gradual and sustained changes in market interest rates might affect net interest income 
we perform simulations quarterly that compare wilmington trust corporation form k a stable interest rate environment to multiple hypothetical interest rate scenarios 
as a rule  our model employs scenarios in which rates gradually move up or down basis points over a period of months 
we believe the primary measure of interest rate risk management is the net interest margin 
the margin was affected negatively in and due to low short term market interest rates

net interest margin for the year ended december net interest margin in and  balances of floating rate assets exceeded balances of floating rate liabilities  floating rate assets repriced more quickly than floating rate liabilities  and our interest rate risk position remained asset sensitive 
repricing characteristics at december in millions commercial loans repricing within to days non core deposits repricing in or fewer days as of december   our interest rate risk simulation model projected that  if short term rates were to increase gradually over a month period in a series of moves that totaled basis points  our net interest income would increase over the months beginning december  simulated effect of interest rate changes on net interest income for the months beginning december gradual increase of basis points gradual decrease of basis points we discontinued modeling the declining rate scenario in december  after the fomc included zero percent in its target rate range  since the declining rate scenario would have created negative interest rates in the model 
our discussion of the interest rate risk simulation model contains forward looking statements about the anticipated effects on net interest income that may result from hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
assumptions about loan and deposit growth  loan and core deposit rates  loan prepayments  asset backed securities  and collateralized mortgage obligations play a significant role in our interest rate simulations 
our assumptions about rates and the pace of changes in payments differ for assets and liabilities in rising as well as in declining rate environments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and the simulations cannot predict precisely how actual interest rate changes might affect our net interest income 
financial market risk we define financial market risk as the risk that declines in equity and debt market valuations could reduce the fees we receive for providing asset management  custody  and other services

among our businesses  regional banking has the most exposure to economic risk 
most of that risk is tied to economic conditions within the mid atlantic region  where our regional banking business is focused 
we believe this exposure is mitigated by the region s diversified economy  which provides a degree of economic stability and helps the region withstand the effects of downturns in any single sector 
we discuss the regional economy in more detail in the regional banking section of this report 
changes in economic conditions at the national and international level that eliminate or slow demand for our services could affect all of our businesses  loan and deposit balances  revenue  net income  and overall results
