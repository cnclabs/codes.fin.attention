item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectibility of trade accounts receivable and inventory valuation 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable fair value due to their short term nature 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of our finished goods inventory is made to order and many of our raw material parts are interchangeable between products 
management assesses the inventory on hand and if necessary writes down the obsolete or excess inventory to market 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery of product to our customer is evidenced through the shipping terms indicating when title and risk of loss is transferred 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined 
the delivery of the goods to our customer completes the earnings process 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see item note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table has been prepared as an aid in understanding the company s results of operations on a comparative basis for the fiscal years ended june   and amounts presented are percentages of the company s net sales 
for the years ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative facility consolidation and other charges operating income loss other expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were million compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
residential net sales were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
commercial net sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of from net sales of million for fiscal the company s operating income improved by million in fiscal year in comparison to the prior year 
the company benefited from strategies implemented and actions taken during fiscal year including consolidation of manufacturing operations and workforce reductions that brought production capacity and fixed overhead more in line with current product demand 
during the prior fiscal year  the company recorded pre tax charges of approximately million related to facility consolidation and employee separation costs 
company wide employment was reduced approximately through plant closures and workforce reductions and remains at these reduced levels 
these factors contributed significantly to gross margin improvements and selling  general and administrative expense reductions 
gross margin for fiscal year was compared to for the prior year period 
the gross margin improvements for the year were greatly impacted by the operational changes discussed above 
in addition  gross margin improved due to stability in material and product costs and lower ocean freight costs 
for the fiscal years ended and  selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales  respectively 
these percentage improvements are due to the operational changes discussed above  as well as  lower bad debt and advertising costs 
interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal year due to lower borrowings 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was 
the effective income tax benefit rate was for fiscal year due to losses or low level of earnings in various tax jurisdictions 
the above factors resulted in net income for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share in fiscal all earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
residential net sales were million compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
commercial net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of from net sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  we believe that our residential product category has performed reasonably well in relation to our competition 
however  residential furniture remains a deferrable purchase item and is adversely impacted by tighter consumer credit  higher unemployment and low levels of consumer confidence 
within commercial sales  the recreational vehicle industry was the hardest hit product category with the initial impact of high fuel costs compounded by credit tightening and lack of consumer confidence in the economy as a whole 
commercial office and hospitality sales held up well early in our fiscal year  but fell considerably as the us economy contracted and credit tightened 
gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for the year is primarily due to an approximate million adjustment to realizable value on inventory and to a lesser extent to under utilization of capacity on significantly lower sales volume 
these factors were partially offset by a lifo benefit increase of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in selling  general and administrative costs is primarily due to under absorption of fixed costs on the lower sales volume and the lag time in reducing advertising and other sales support costs to the lower volume 
the company recorded million in facility consolidation and employee separation costs during fiscal year these costs related to consolidating manufacturing operations and workforce reductions to bring production capacity in line with current and expected demand for the company s products 
interest expense decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  due to lower borrowings and interest rates 
although the company s full year tax rate is typically in the range  fiscal year ended june  reflects an effective income tax benefit rate of due to losses or low level of earnings in various tax jurisdictions 
the effective income tax expense rate was for the fiscal year ended june  the above factors resulted in net loss for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per share compared to net income of million or per share for the fiscal year ended june  all earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources working capital current assets less current liabilities at june  was million as compared to million at june  significant changes in working capital from june  to june  included increased cash of million and increased accounts receivable of million 
the increase in receivables is primarily related to higher shipment volume in the fourth quarter 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year reflecting net income of million  working capital changes of million and non cash charges of million 
the change in net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal year was comprised primarily of reductions in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million partially offset by reductions in accounts payable of million 
the company expects that due to the nature of our operations that there will be continuing fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and cash flows from operations due to the following i we purchase inventory from overseas suppliers with long lead times and depending on the timing of the delivery of those orders  inventory levels can be greatly impacted  and ii we ha ve various customers that purchase large quantities of inventory periodically and the timing of those purchases can significantly impact inventory levels  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term borrowings 
as discussed below the company believes it has adequate financing arrangements and access to capital to absorb these fluctuations in operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year net purchases of investments were million 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended depreciation expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal year net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year cash from operating activities was used to reduce borrowings by million and pay dividends of million 
management believes that the company has adequate cash and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements for fiscal year in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities as they arise  to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders  and to purchase productive capital assets that enhance safety and improve operations 
at june   the company has no long term debt obligations and therefore  no contractual interest payments are included in the table below 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at june  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in the future in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations contractual obligations associated with the company s deferred compensation plans were excluded from the table above as the company cannot predict when the events that trigger payment will occur 
total accumulated deferred compensation liabilities were million at june  at june  the company had no capital lease obligations  and no purchase obligations for raw materials or finished goods 
the purchase price on all open purchase orders was fixed and denominated in us dollars 
additionally  the company has excluded the tax contingency reserve from the above table  as the timing of payments  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated 
financing arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
outlook we enter the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet reflecting working capital in excess of million and no bank borrowings 
we had an increase in sales volume for the current quarter over the prior year quarter  and anticipate modest improvement in sales volume will continue in fiscal we believe that we have the necessary manufacturing capacity  importing capability and fixed cost controls in place to meet current and expected demand for our products 
however  we are experiencing selected cost increases on various manufacturing component materials and increases on ocean freight rates in comparison to prior year rates 
our residential product category has performed well in relation to our competition  and we anticipate continued improvement in the residential sales category 
however  residential furniture remains a highly deferrable item and can be adversely impacted by factors  such as  low levels of consumer confidence  a depressed market for housing  limited consumer credit and high unemployment 
demand for our commercial product shipments fell considerably as the us economy contracted and credit tightened 
while we believe that commercial product sales are at or near the bottom of the downward cycle and should level off  we do not anticipate significant improvements in commercial markets before the second half of fiscal year we remain committed to our core strategies  which include a wide range of quality product offerings and price points to the residential and commercial markets  combined with a conservative approach to business 
we will maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet through emphasis on cash flow and improving profitability 
we believe these core strategies will be in the best interest of our shareholders in the longer term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant f luctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   the company does not have any debt outstanding 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates which are important components of costs for the company and could have an adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products
