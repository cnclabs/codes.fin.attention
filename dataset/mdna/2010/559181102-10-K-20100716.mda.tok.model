item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and results appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
throughout this section  we make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of any statements that do not relate to historical or current facts or matters are forward looking statements 
you can often identify these and other forward looking statements by terms such as becoming  may  will  should  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology  or the use of future tense 
statements concerning current conditions may also be forward looking if they imply a continuation of current conditions 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to our belief that our current facilities are adequate to support our current and near term operations our expectations about future revenue and our belief that revenue fluctuations are a result of timing of customer purchases of service our expectation that our research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will remain at levels comparable to prior years as a percentage of revenue our expectation that we will attain a certain level of cash flow from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  acquired workforce and acquired developed technologies and patents our expectation that our sales cycle will lengthen our expectation that our backlog orders are firm our belief that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our anticipated operating and working capital requirements  capital investments and debt service our belief that our acquisitions will enable us to compete successfully in the eda industry and our expectation that we will be able to make acquisitions in the future our expectation that we will be able to continue to use earnout arrangements to consummate our acquisitions and our belief that these arrangements will not complicate integration efforts our expected costs to develop in process research and development from an acquired company into commercially viable products our stock price volatility although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  and we have based these expectations on our beliefs and assumptions  such expectations may prove to be incorrect 
our actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our forward looking statements 
these statements involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  
table of contents the risks discussed under the heading risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
we do not intend  and undertake no obligation  to update any of our forward looking statements after the date of this annual report on form k to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances 
change in fiscal year end prior to fiscal  we had a week fiscal year ending on the first sunday subsequent to march on january   our board of directors approved a change of fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on the first sunday subsequent to march to a fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to april except for any given year in which april is a sunday  in which case the fiscal year will end on april  starting with fiscal our fiscal years consist of four quarters of weeks each except for each fifth or sixth fiscal year  which includes one quarter with weeks 
our fiscal year began on may  and ended on may   resulting in a one month transition period that began on april  and ended on may  the separate audited financial statements required for the transition period were included on form k for the fiscal year ended may   which was filed with the sec on july  references in this form k to fiscal represent the weeks ended may   references to fiscal represent the weeks ended may  and references to fiscal represent the weeks ended april  we have not submitted financial information for the weeks ended april  in this form k because the information is not practical or cost effective to prepare 
we believe that the weeks of fiscal provide a meaningful comparison to the weeks of fiscal and fiscal presented in this form k 
we do not believe that there are any significant factors  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends if results for the weeks ended april  were presented in lieu of results for the weeks ended may  we did not experience an unusual amount of business activity or product shipment in the transition month and have reported the loss incurred in that month in our consolidated statements of operations in item of this form k 
accordingly  we have not included the results of the one month transition period that began on april  and ended on may  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

below is a summary of our operations for fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease of from the prior year 
licenses and bundled licenses and services sales for fiscal and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
in fiscal cash provided from operating  investing and financing activities  as shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows  was million  million and million  respectively  as compared to cash used in operating and investing activities of million and million and cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal basic and diluted net loss per share decreased from per share in fiscal to per share in fiscal our employee headcount decreased to as of may   down from as of may  most of the decrease in employees represents reductions to research and development and sales and marketing personnel 
global markets recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through fiscal continued concerns about the global financial and banking 
table of contents system  systemic impact of inflation or deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy generally 
these concerns  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have recently contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
in particular  the semiconductor industry continues to be materially adversely affected by the macroeconomic environment 
as a result of these market conditions  the availability and cost of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the financial markets has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and global markets and economies has adversely affected our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may continue to limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
recent acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal  we did not acquire any companies and did not make any material asset purchases 
during fiscal  we acquired companies and purchased technologies that enable us to expand into new markets 
we believe that these acquisitions will be a significant factor in our ability to compete successfully in the eda industry and we expect to make similar acquisitions in the future 
on february   we acquired sabio labs  inc  sabio a privately held developer of analog design solutions for mixed signal designers 
sabio s software enables designers to create robust analog designs  efficiently port complex circuits to new process technologies in foundries  and explore system design trade offs early in the design process 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was million  consisting of approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million and transaction costs of  as part of the initial consideration   shares of our common stock valued at million was associated with employee retention and is being earned and recorded as compensation expenses in accordance with such employees vesting schedules 
in addition  we agreed to pay up to million of contingent consideration in the form of cash or shares of magma common stock  at our discretion  to the former sabio stockholders upon achieving certain product integration and booking milestones 
during fiscal and fiscal  a total of million and million  respectively in gross contingent cash consideration and a total of million in gross contingent stock consideration in fiscal were earned by various acquired businesses upon their achievement of certain milestones under various prior asset purchase and business combination agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the most significant potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  unbilled accounts receivable  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash equivalent  short term and long term investments  strategic investments  asset purchases and business combinations  valuation of long lived assets and income taxes to be our most critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition asc  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to us 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for each element of a license arrangement and maintenance is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value does exist for the elements that have not been delivered  but does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which recognition of revenue for the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual license fee is recognized as revenue immediately 
our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
management has made significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectability is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue is recognized when customer installments are due and payable 
in order for an arrangement to be considered to have fixed or determinable fees  of the license  services and initial post contract support fee is to be paid within one year or less from the order date 
we have a history of collecting fees on such arrangements according to contractual terms 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond twelve months are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
collectability is probable 
in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment about the collectability of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectability is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial positions and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash receipts basis as each payment is collected 
licenses revenue and bundled licenses and services revenue we derive license revenue primarily from licenses of our design and implementation software and  to a lesser extent  from licenses of our analysis and verification products 
we license our products under time based and perpetual licenses whereby license revenue is recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for perpetual licenses and unbundled time based license arrangements  where maintenance is included for the first period of the license term  with maintenance thereafter renewable by the customer at the substantive rates stated in their agreements with us  the stated rate for maintenance renewal is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance in these arrangements 
for these arrangements  license revenue is recognized using the residual method in the period in which the license agreement is executed 
table of contents assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
where an arrangement involves extended payment terms  revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable 
for transactions that include bundled maintenance for the entire license term we have no vsoe of fair value of maintenance 
therefore  we recognize license revenue ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms that is  where payment for less than of the arrangement fee is due within one year of the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the amount due and payable or the ratable portion 
we classify the revenue recognized from these transactions separately as bundled licenses and services revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed 
our consulting and training services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product 
additional factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on our ability to recognize the software license fee 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
under asc  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  over the vesting period of the award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires the input of various highly subjective assumptions  including expected future stock price volatility  expected term of instruments and expected forfeiture rates 
we established the expected term for employee options and awards  as well as forfeiture rates  based on the historical settlement experience  while giving consideration to vesting schedules and to options that have estimated life cycles less than the contractual terms 
assumptions for option exercises and pre vesting terminations of options were stratified for employee groups with sufficiently distinct behavior patterns 
expected future stock price volatility was developed based on the average of our historical weekly stock price volatility and average implied volatility 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
unbilled accounts receivable unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of being invoiced to the customer 
in all cases  the revenue and unbilled receivables are for contracts that are non cancelable  in which there are no contingencies and where the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
we typically generate invoices days in advance of contractual due dates  and we invoice the entire amount of the unbilled accounts receivable within one year from the contract inception 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using the factors described above 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration in any one customer  industry or geographic region 
as of may  and as of may   none of our customers accounted for more than of total receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
if actual losses are significantly greater than the allowance we have established  our general and administrative expenses and reported net loss would increase 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our allowance  our general and administrative expenses would decrease and our reported net income would increase 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities we account for financial instruments in accordance with asc  financial instruments overall recognition asc 
asc permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  enables entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we adopted asc in the first quarter of fiscal our adoption of asc permits us to elect to carry certain financial instruments at fair value with corresponding changes in fair value reported in the results of operations 
the election to carry an instrument at fair value is made at the individual contract level and can be made only at origination or inception of the instrument  or upon the occurrence of an event that results in a new basis of accounting 
our election is on a prospective basis and is irrevocable 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we elected fair value accounting for the purchased put option recorded in connection with the settlement agreement signed with ubs financial services  inc ubs 
this election was made in order to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by accounting for the purchased put option and underlying auction rate securities ars under different methods 
total net gain on the ars of million was offset by loss on the put option million resulted in a net gain of million reported in valuation gain loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended may   respectively 
cash equivalent  short term investments and long term investments we account for our investments in accordance with asc  investments in debt and equity securities asc 
these investments are typically classified as trading  and the gains or losses are recorded in other income or expense on the statement of operations or available for sale  and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as of the balance sheet date  with gains or losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of may   investments in ars have been classified as trading  and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as of the balance sheet date  with gains or losses recorded as other income or expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we measure fair value in accordance with the provisions in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value and establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs  
table of contents such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as at may  consist of ars that are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education and the ubs purchased put option 
the ars investments were classified as long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as at may  historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate generally every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs that provided us with auction rate securities rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period from june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a purchased put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs could  at its discretion  sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and be required to pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
additionally  ubs offered a no net cost secured line of credit to us up to of the market value of the ars as determined by ubs that expired on june  due to our entering into this agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities as of may  on july   we exercised our put option and liquidated the million ars and repaid the outstanding million secured line of credit to ubs 
as of may  there was insufficient observable market information available to determine the fair value of our ars 
prior to november   we estimated level fair values for these securities based on the investment bank s valuations 
the investment bank valued student loan arss as floating rate notes with three pricing inputs the coupon  the current discount margin or spread  and the maturity 
the coupon was generally assumed to equal the maximum rate allowed under the terms of the instrument  the current discount margin was based on an assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing comparable risks  and the maturity was based on an assessment of the terms of the underlying instrument and the potential for restructuring the ars 
the primary unobservable input to the valuation was the maturity assumption  which was set at four years for the majority of ars instruments 
through january   the ars were valued at par value due to the frequent resets that historically occurred through the auction process 
as of may   we engaged a third party valuation service to model level fair value using an income approach and two scenarios one based on a year term and no put option  and a second based on a year term with a put option 
we reviewed the methodologies employed by the third party models 
this included a review of all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model assumptions 
the pricing assumptions for the ars included the coupon rate  the estimated time to liquidity  current market rates for publicly traded student loans of similar credit rating and an adjustment for lack of liquidity 
the student loans are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education  and have maturities ranging from to the coupon rate was assumed to equal the stated maximum auction rate being received  which is determined based on the applicable day us treasury rate plus premium according to provisions outlined in each security s agreement 
the estimated time to liquidity was years based on i expectations from industry brokers for liquidity in the market and ii the period over which ubs and other broker dealers that had issued ars have agreed to redeem certain ars at par value 

table of contents the purchased put option gives us the right to sell the ars to ubs for a price equal to par value during the period june  to july   providing liquidity for the ars sooner than the estimated years 
as we planned to exercise the purchased put option on or around june   the value of the purchased put option was determined based on i the ability to sell the securities thereby creating liquidity approximately year before the ars market is expected to become liquid and ii the avoidance of receiving below market coupon rate while the security is illiquid and auctions are failing 
the fair value of the purchased put option represents the difference between the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years and the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of year as the purchased put option allows for the acceleration of liquidity and the avoidance of a below market coupon rate over the two year time period 
based on the level valuation and the transfer of the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million in valuation gain loss  net in the second quarter of fiscal including the transfer of accumulated temporary losses of million from other comprehensive loss previously recorded as a component of stockholder equity 
for fiscal  the total loss on the ars  including the other than temporary loss of million  was reported in the valuation gain loss  net in the consolidated statement of operations  this loss was offset by gains related to the purchase put option of million 
for the year ended may   we recorded a gain on the ars of million offset by losses related to the purchased put option of million 
accounting for asset purchases and business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired assets and business combinations to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the value of intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  acquired workforce and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  which could result in changes in the purchase price allocation 
goodwill impairment asc  goodwill asc  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of the reporting units 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit see note  segment information  to our consolidated financial statements in item 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting units 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents asc provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the company reporting unit to its net book value 
to determine the fair value  we use a market approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding of our common stock 
if the fair value is greater than net book value  no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
we use the income method for the second step 
the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates  including the following for the reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and our assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
during fiscal  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test at december  using the market approach for the first step 
at december   we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the book value of the net assets of the reporting unit and therefore concluded there is no impairment of goodwill 
accordingly we did not proceed to the second step 
during fiscal  we conducted this test during the third quarter and concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal that showed the existence of impairment indicators  including a significant decline in our stock price and continued deterioration in the eda software products market and the related impact on our revenue forecasts 
consistent with our approach in our annual impairment testing  in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit  we considered both the market approach and income approach 
at december   using the step one market approach  we determined that the fair value of our reporting units was less than the book value of the net assets of the reporting unit and accordingly  we performed step two of the impairment test 
in step two of the impairment test  we determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
our step two analysis resulted in a reduction in fair value of goodwill  and therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal valuation of intangibles and long lived assets our intangible assets include acquired intangibles  excluding goodwill 
acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and technologies original lives assigned are one to six years 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment asc 
for assets to be held and used  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
based on our review  no impairment is indicated 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  there are 
table of contents many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  which could result in proposed assessments 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these tax matters will not be different from what was reflected in our historical income tax provisions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  as well as federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that the recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
as of may   we believe a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets is required 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
strategic investments in privately held companies our strategic equity investments consist of preferred stock and convertible notes that are convertible into preferred or common stock of several privately held companies 
the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic equity investments totaled million at may  our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and convertible notes and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute on their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain additional capital funding to continue operations 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
for equity investments where our ownership interest is between to  or where we can exercise significant influence on the investee s operating or financial decisions  we record our share of net equity income loss of the investee based on our proportionate ownership 
during the first quarter of fiscal we made an additional investment in zerosoft  inc of million  which increased our ownership in that company to as of may  we also invested million in helic inc during the first quarter of fiscal  bringing our ownership in helic to as of may  in addition  one of our executives is a member of the board of directors of helic  which permits us to exercise significant influence on helic s operating decisions 
we have recorded our share of net equity income loss of these investments based on our proportionate ownership in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  synopsys  inc purchased of the outstanding stock of zerosoft  inc  for million in cash and future contingent cash payments 
our ownership interest in zerosoft  inc at the time of the sale resulted in million in cash at closing and million in contingent proceeds 
the contingent proceeds consist of a holdback amount equal to of the initial consideration to be held in escrow and released for payment months from the date of the agreement to secure the indemnification obligations of the sellers  and earnout consideration based upon the achievement of certain annual product performance improvement milestones for the three years subsequent to the sale agreement 
the proceeds net of expenses of million offset against the net book value of the investment of million on the date of sale of the investment resulted in a net gain of million  which was recorded in the statement of operations in other income 
the holdback amount and earnout consideration are gain contingencies each representing incremental income and will be recognized when all contingencies are resolved per asc  contingencies 

table of contents we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the fair value analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  such as when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have experienced volatility over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairment charges related to these non marketable equity investments of million in fiscal we did not record impairment charges related to these non marketable equity investments in fiscal results of operations revenue overview revenue is comprised of licenses revenue  bundled licenses and services revenue  and services revenue 
licenses revenue consists of fees for time based or perpetual licenses of our software products 
bundled licenses and services revenue consists of fees for software licenses and post contract customer support pcs where we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of pcs 
services revenue consists of fees for services  such as customer training  consulting and pcs associated with licenses where we have established vsoe to account for services separately 
we recognize revenue based on the specific terms and conditions of the license contracts with our customer for our products and services as described in detail above under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates 
in our consolidated financial statements  we classify our license arrangements as either bundled or unbundled 
bundled license contracts include maintenance with the license fee and do not include optional maintenance periods 
unbundled license contracts have separate maintenance fees and include optional maintenance periods 
the company offers various contractual terms to its customers in designing license agreements to accommodate customer preferences  which are unrelated to product performance and service requirements  order volume  or pricing 
the contractual terms that result in the recognition of bundled licenses and services revenue are subject to customer preferences and have historically been inconsistently elected by customers 
moreover  revenue from existing long term contracts frequently shifts between revenue categories  with no change in the aggregate revenues recognized from such contracts 
in light of the foregoing  the company has concluded that changes in results of the bundled licenses and services revenue category generally do not indicate a material trend in the company s historical or future performance and therefore are not discussed below 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we classify our revenue as either licenses or services 
bundled licenses and services are divided into their component parts and included with either licenses or services for management analysis 
licenses revenue is divided into the following categories ratable due payable up front cash receipts 
table of contents services revenue is analyzed separately from the licenses revenue portion 
we use these classifications of revenue to provide greater insight into the reporting and monitoring of trends in the components of our revenue and to assist us in managing our business 
the characterization of an individual contract may change over time 
for example  a contract originally characterized as ratable may be redefined as cash receipts if that customer has difficulty in making payments in a timely fashion 
in cases where a contract has been re characterized for management reporting and analysis purposes  prior periods are not restated to reflect that change 
licenses revenue ratable 
for bundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the contract term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if less 
in our statements of operations the revenue for these bundled arrangements for both license and service is classified as bundled licenses and services 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we separate the licenses portion from the services portion of the revenue 
for unbundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the license term 
we generally refer to these licenses as ratable and we generally refer to all time based licenses recognized on a ratable basis as long term  independent of the actual length of term of the license 
due payable 
for unbundled time based licenses where the payment terms extend greater than one year from the arrangement effective date  we recognize license revenue on a due and payable basis 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we generally refer to this type of license as due payable 
up front 
for unbundled time based and perpetual licenses  we recognize license revenue upon shipment if the payment terms require the customer to pay of the license fee and the initial period of pcs within one year from the agreement date and payments are generally linear 
in all of these cases  the contracts are non cancelable  and the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we generally refer to this type of license as up front  where the license is either perpetual or time based 
cash receipts 
we recognize revenue from customers who have not met our predetermined credit criteria on a cash receipts basis to the extent that revenue has otherwise been earned 
we recognize license revenue as we receive cash payments from these customers 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license revenue as cash receipts 
our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the mix and volume of perpetual or short term licenses ordered during the quarter and the amount of long term ratable  due payable  and cash receipts license revenue recognized during the quarter 
in general  we refer to license revenue recognized from perpetual or time based licenses during the quarter as up front revenue  for management reporting and analysis purposes 
all other types of revenue are generally referred to as revenue from backlog 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain mix of short term licenses 
the precise mix of orders fluctuates substantially from period to period and affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve our target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we have more than expected long term licenses or may exceed them if we have more than expected short term or perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we also may not meet our revenue targets as described in the risk factors in item a of this form k 
services revenue services revenue is primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over the 
table of contents maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed

table of contents revenue revenue for fiscal was million  down from fiscal licenses revenue 
we analyzed the license purchasing trends of our key customers  those that make up or more of revenue 
license revenue decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the license revenue was due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor and systems industries  which caused customers to reduce spending 
although license revenue in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal  license revenue as percentage of total revenue remained the same due to the enhanced versions of several existing products gaining initial market acceptance 
licenses revenue decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal licenses revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in licenses revenue was primarily the result of a sharp downturn in the semiconductor and systems industries  a reduced number of design starts  a reduction of electronic design automation budgets and customers experiencing continued end market softness in demand and reduced visibility in forecasting their business  which caused customers to reduce spending 
ratable revenue decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in ratable revenue was to due to the overall decrease in the total revenue as compared to the fiscal  which was due to the continued downturn in the economic conditions 
although ratable revenue decreased by million from fiscal as compared to fiscal  ratable revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from to due to our intent to increase the portion of revenue based on backlog to or more of total revenue to reduce volatility and increase the predictability of our revenues  and thereby reduce up front revenues to or less of total revenue 
ratable revenue decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset as a result of our intent to increase the portion of revenue based on backlog to or more of total revenue to reduce volatility and increase the predictability of our revenues  and thereby reduce due payable and up front revenues to or less of total revenue  which resulted in ratable revenue increasing from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal due payable revenue increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in the due payable revenue was due to our intent to increase the portion of revenue based on backlog to or more revenue and thereby reduce up front revenues to or less of total revenue 
in addition  the increase in the due payable revenue is also due to customer preference 
ratable and due payable revenue  as a percent of total fiscal revenue  increased  this was a result of our efforts to increase the portion of revenue based on backlog to or more of total revenue to reduce volatility 
up front revenue decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  a decrease of 
up front revenue decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  a decrease of 
the decreases were attributable to our efforts to reduce up front revenue and increase ratable and due payable revenue 
cash receipts revenue decreased during fiscal by million compared to fiscal the decrease is due to fewer customers being classified as cash receipt customers in fiscal compared to fiscal cash receipts revenue increased during fiscal by million compared to fiscal additional customers had been classified as cash receipts customers 
this increase is the result of the impact of a deterioration of economic conditions in the industry and with respect to some of our customers 
services revenue decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was generally proportionate to the decrease in the total revenues during the periods 
service revenue as a percentage of total 
table of contents revenue remained the same in fiscal and fiscal and increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the fluctuations were a result of timing of customers purchase of services 
although customers delayed license purchases in response to the end market softness in the demand  customers did continue to purchase maintenance contracts and other services to support their ongoing activities 
domestic revenue decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal  and decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal international revenue decreased by and for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in domestic and international revenue was primarily the result of the global impact of a sharp downturn in the semiconductor and systems industries  a reduced number of design starts  a reduction of electronic design automation budgets and customers experiencing continued end market softness in demand and reduced visibility in forecasting their business 
the decreases in revenues were generally proportionate to the decreases in total revenues during the periods and were primarily due to decreased customer orders 
domestic and international revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained the same for fiscal year and fiscal year no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenue during the fiscal years  and cost of revenue cost of licenses revenue primarily consists of amortization of acquired developed technology and other intangible assets that are fixed in nature and variable expenses such as royalties  and allocated outside sales representative expenses 
cost of licenses revenue decreased by million or during fiscal  compared to fiscal amortization charges related to acquired developed technology and intangible assets decreased during by million compared to fiscal primarily due to the complete amortization of intangibles acquired on the mojave acquisition  which were fully amortized at the end of fiscal in addition  the decrease in the cost of license revenue was due to the decrease in third party distributor commissions by million  and decrease of million in costs related to expensed equipment

this information was not available to us in previous financial reporting periods and is considered new information for purposes of assessing the company s uncertain tax positions 
we considered this new information collectively with all other information available and concluded that it is more likely than not the license revenue sourced in south korea is not subject to withholding tax  and therefore  that the full amount of the tax position will ultimately be realized

short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as at may  consist of ars that are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education and the ubs purchased put option 
the ars investments were classified as long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as at may  historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate generally every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides us with auction rate securities rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a purchased put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs may  at its discretion  sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
additionally  ubs offered a no net cost secured line of credit to us up to of the market value of the ars as determined by ubs until june  due to our entering into this agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities 
on july   we exercised our put option and liquidated the million ars and repaid the outstanding million secured line of credit to ubs 
as of may  there was insufficient observable market information available to determine the fair value of our ars 
prior to november   we estimated level fair values for these securities based on the investment bank s valuations 
the investment bank valued student loan arss as floating rate notes with three pricing inputs the coupon  the current discount margin or spread  and the maturity 
the coupon was generally assumed to equal the maximum rate allowed under the terms of the instrument  the current discount margin was based on an assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing comparable risks  and the maturity was based on an assessment of the terms of the underlying instrument and the potential for restructuring the ars 
the primary unobservable input to the valuation was the maturity assumption which was set at four years for the majority of ars instruments 
through january   the ars were valued at par value due to the frequent resets that historically occurred through the auction process 

table of contents as of may   we engaged a third party valuation service to model level fair value using an income approach and two scenarios one based on a year term and no put option  and a second based on a year term with a put option 
we reviewed the methodologies employed by the third party models 
this included a review of all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model assumptions 
the pricing assumptions for the ars included the coupon rate  the estimated time to liquidity  current market rates for publicly traded student loans of similar credit rating and an adjustment for lack of liquidity 
the student loans are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education  and have maturities ranging from to the coupon rate was assumed to equal the stated maximum auction rate being received  which is determined based on the applicable day us treasury rate plus premium according to provisions outlined in each security s agreement 
the current estimated time to liquidity was years based on i expectations from industry brokers for liquidity in the market and ii the period over which ubs and other broker dealers that had issued ars have agreed to redeem certain ars at par value 
the purchased put option gives us the right to sell the ars to ubs for a price equal to par value during the period june  to july   providing liquidity for the ars sooner than the currently estimated years 
as we plan to exercise the purchased put option on or around june   the value of the purchased put option lies in i the ability to sell the securities thereby creating liquidity approximately year before the ars market is expected to become liquid and ii the avoidance of receiving below market coupon rate while the security is illiquid and auctions are failing 
the fair value of the purchased put option represents the difference between the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years and the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of year as the purchased put option allows for the acceleration of liquidity and the avoidance of a below market coupon rate over the two year time period 
based on the level valuation and the transfer of the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million in valuation gain loss  net in the second quarter of fiscal including the transfer of accumulated temporary losses of million from other comprehensive loss previously recorded as a component of stockholder equity 
for fiscal  the total loss on the ars  including the other than temporary loss of million  was reported in the valuation gain loss  net in the consolidated statement of operations  this loss was offset by gains related to the purchase put option of million 
for the year ended may   we recorded an unrealized gain on the ars of million offset by losses related to the purchased put option of million

the decrease in cash from customers was due to the lower revenues  while cost and expenses decreased due to the reduction in force and the closure of various facilities as part of our fiscal restructuring plan

in the first quarter of fiscal  we began implementing cost reduction measures that continued through the end of fiscal given the current adverse economic conditions generally  and in the semiconductor industry in particular  the credit market crisis and our own liquidity position  we have increased our focus on cash management and identifying and taking actions to sustain and enhance our liquidity position 
these actions include operational expense reduction initiatives and re timing or eliminating certain capital spending or research and development projects 
as a result of these efforts and other factors  we generated positive cash flow of million of cash from operations in fiscal we have been successful in refinancing our current debt as of may  our ability to fund our cash needs over the short and long term will also depend on our ability to continue to generate cash from operations  which is subject to general economic and financial market conditions  competition  maintaining our existing credit facility  and other factors 
we believe we have sufficient capital resources to fund our working capital requirements and operations  capital investments  and debt service during the next twelve months 
however any of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations

as a result of the exchange  approximately million principal amount of the notes remained outstanding as of may  on may   we repaid the million remaining outstanding balance of the notes

as of may   we were in compliance with all financial conditions included in the indentures for the notes and the notes 

table of contents in july  we repurchased million of aggregate principal amount of its notes  representing approximately of the previously outstanding aggregate principal amount of notes  in private transactions 
these purchases were funded from our working capital 
see note  subsequent events repurchases of common stock on february   we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
in march  we used approximately million to repurchase  shares of our common stock in the open market 
the repurchased shares are to be used for general corporate purposes 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during contractual obligations as of may   our principal contractual obligations consisted of million from fiscal through fiscal for office facilities  repayments of million of the notes due in may  million of the notes due in may and million in capital lease obligations for computer equipment and purchase obligations 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we do not anticipate an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments with cost reduction plans that were initiated in fiscal purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of may  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
in addition  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
our acquisition agreements related to certain business combination and asset purchase transactions obligate us to pay certain contingent cash consideration based on meeting certain financial or project milestones and continued employment of certain employees 
the total amount of contingent cash consideration that could be paid under our acquisition agreements  assuming all contingencies are met  was million as of may  subject to the uncertainties further described in capital resources above  these contingent consideration obligations are not expected to affect our estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at may   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
the operating lease obligations and purchase obligations were not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of may  payment due by period total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations convertible notes purchase obligations term debt total 
table of contents income taxes as of may  and may   we recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million  and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  are included in our long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are not able to estimate the amount or timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  however  we do not anticipate the settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of may   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
indemnification obligations we enter into standard license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent  copyright  or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
these indemnification obligations have perpetual terms 
our normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount of indemnification to the amount received from the customer 
on occasion  the maximum amount of indemnification we may be required to make may exceed our normal business practices 
we estimate the fair value of our indemnification obligations as insignificant  based on our historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for indemnification under these agreements as of may  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we retain directors and officers insurance that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover portions of amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of may  in connection with certain of our recent business acquisitions  we have also agreed to assume  or cause our subsidiaries to assume  the indemnification obligations of those companies to their respective officers and directors 
no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of may  warranties we warrant to our customers that our products will conform to the documentation provided 
to date  there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of may  we assess the need for a warranty accrual on a quarterly basis  and there can be no guarantee that a warranty accrual will not become necessary in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of may   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt  due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of our debt obligation 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments generally consist of government agencies  municipal obligations and money market funds with high quality financial institutions 
accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from license and service sales 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies  primarily related to a portion of revenue in japan and operating expenses in europe  japan and asia pacific 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of may   we had approximately million of cash and money market funds in foreign currencies 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate exposure in movements between the us dollar and japanese yen 
the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under asc we recognize the gain and loss on foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement loss and gain of the related foreign currency denominated exposures 
in fiscal and  net foreign exchange loss totaled million and gain totaled million  respectively  and was included in other expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations
