item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
arbitron inc generally measures radio station ratings weekly for markets measured by the portable people meter tm and four times a year for markets measured by diaries 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 

table of contents the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
known trends and uncertainties although the recent global recession has negatively impacted advertising revenues for a wide variety of media businesses  domestic radio revenue growth has been challenged for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of four factors unrelated to the recession the emergence of new media  such as various media content distributed via the internet  telecommunication companies and cable interconnects  which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising  advertisers lack of confidence in the ratings of radio stations due to dated ratings gathering methods  and a lack of inventory and pricing discipline by radio operators 
the company and the radio industry have begun several initiatives to address these issues 
the radio industry is working aggressively to increase the number of portable digital media devices that contain an fm tuner  including smartphones and music players 
in many countries  fm tuners are common features in portable digital media devices 
the radio industry is working with leading united states network providers  device manufacturers  regulators and legislators to ensure that fm tuners are included in most future portable digital media devices 
including fm as a feature on these devices has the potential to increase radio listening and improve perception of the radio industry while offering network providers the benefits of a proven emergency notification system  reduced network congestion from audio streaming services  and a host of new revenue generating applications 
the company has also aggressively worked to harness the power of broadband and mobile media distribution in the development of emerging business opportunities by becoming one of the ten largest streaming audio providers in the united states  developing highly interactive websites with content that engages our listeners  using sms texting and delivering real time traffic to navigation devices 
along with the rest of the radio industry  the majority of our stations have deployed hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional digital channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together in each radio market to ensure the most diverse consumer offering possible and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we are participating in a joint venture with other broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party will use to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigation devices 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 

table of contents arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm tm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service began in the new york  los angeles and chicago markets in october  in the st 
louis market in october  and is planned for introduction in the austin and indianapolis markets in the fall of in each market in which the service has launched  there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all stations in the market  increasing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars 
in addition  ratings for certain stations when measured by the ppm tm as opposed to the traditional diary methodology can be materially different 
the company continues to evaluate the impact ppm tm will have on our revenues in these markets 
as discussed below  our radio stations in los angeles and new york have trailed the performance of their respective markets 
management believes this relative underperformance is principally due to two factors our lack of scale in these markets and the introduction of ppm tm to these markets in october some of our competitors operate larger station clusters in new york and los angeles than we do  enabling them to use their market share to extract a greater percentage of available advertising revenue through discounting unit rates 
our stations in new york and los angeles principally target demographics that suffer a disproportionate decline in ratings when measured by the ppm tm as compared to the previously used diary methodology 
management expects the impact we have experienced from the adoption of the ppm tm to abate in our next fiscal year 
our los angeles and new york markets collectively account for approximately of our domestic radio revenues 
on april   emmis entered into an lma and a put and call agreement for kmvn fm in los angeles with a subsidiary of grupo radio centro  sab de c 
v grc  a mexican broadcasting company 
the lma for kmvn fm commenced on april  and will continue for up to seven years 
the lma requires million in annual payments plus reimbursement of certain expenses 
grc paid the first two years of lma payments in advance at closing 
at any time during the lma  grc has the right to purchase the station for million 
at the end of the term  emmis has the right to require grc to purchase the station for the same amount 
under the lma  emmis continues to own and operate the station  with grc providing emmis with broadcast programming 
in connection with the lma  the call letters of the station changed from kmvn fm to kxos fm 
the performance of emmis other los angeles radio station  kpwr fm  trailed the performance of the overall market 
for the twelve month period ended february   kpwr fm s gross revenues were down whereas the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co 
miller kaplan reported that the los angeles market total gross revenues were down versus the same period of the prior year 
our radio cluster in new york trailed the performance of the overall new york radio market during the twelve month period ended february  for the twelve month period ended february   our new york radio stations gross revenues were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that new york radio market total gross revenues were down versus the same period of the prior year 
while the general pace of business has improved over the past twelve months  the ongoing recovery remains unpredictable 
for example  our domestic radio division s revenues were up approximately in the month of march as compared to the same month from the prior year  but were down in the month of april as compared to the same month from the prior year 
as of may   our domestic radio division s revenues for the months of may and june as compared to the same month of the prior year are flat and up  respectively 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  the august amendment to emmis operating company s the company s principal operating subsidiary  hereinafter eoc credit agreement substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions prior to september we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
in particular  we have one radio station in new york city and two radio stations in chicago where we believe the sale value could exceed the prospects for cash flow generation as part of our portfolio 
although we remain optimistic about the growth potential of these stations  as the market for buying and selling radio stations improves  we may from time to time explore sales of one or more of these stations 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
revenue recognition broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements are aired 
publication revenue is recognized in the month of delivery of the publication 
both broadcasting revenue and publication revenue recognition is subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time the advertisement is aired for broadcasting revenue and upon delivery of the publication for publication revenue 
advertising revenues presented in the financial statements are reflected on a net basis  after the deduction of advertising agency fees  usually at a rate of of gross revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on management s judgment of the collectability of receivables 
when assessing the collectability of receivables  management considers  among other things  historical loss experience and existing economic conditions 
fcc licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   we have recorded approximately in goodwill and fcc licenses  which represents approximately of our total assets 
in the case of our us radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
we consider our fcc licenses to be indefinite lived intangibles 
our foreign broadcasting licenses expire during periods ranging from december to february we will need to submit applications to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
while there is a general expectancy of renewal of radio broadcast licenses in most countries and we expect to actively seek renewal of our foreign licenses  most of the countries in which we operate do not have the regulatory framework or history that we have with respect to license renewals in the united states 
this makes the risk of non renewal or of renewal on less favorable terms of foreign licenses greater than for united states licenses  as was recently demonstrated in hungary when our broadcasting license was not renewed in november under circumstances that even a hungarian court ruled violated the hungarian media law 
we treat our foreign broadcasting licenses as definite lived intangibles and amortize them over their respective license periods 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
when evaluating our radio broadcasting licenses for impairment  the testing is performed at the unit of accounting level as determined by accounting standards codification asc topic in our case  radio stations in a geographic market cluster are considered a single unit of accounting  provided that they are not being operated under a local marketing agreement by another broadcaster 
we complete our annual impairment tests on december of each year and perform additional interim impairment testing whenever triggering events suggest such testing is warranted 
valuation of indefinite lived broadcasting licenses fair value of our fcc licenses is estimated to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to determine the fair value of our fcc licenses  the company uses an income valuation method when it performs its impairment tests 
under this method  the company projects cash flows that would be generated by each of its units of accounting assuming the unit of accounting was commencing operations in its respective market at the beginning of the valuation period 
this cash flow stream is discounted to arrive at a value for the fcc license 
the company assumes the competitive situation that exists in each market remains unchanged  with the exception that its unit of accounting commenced operations at the beginning of the valuation period 
in doing so  the company extracts the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly values the fcc license 
major assumptions involved in this analysis include market revenue  market revenue growth rates  unit of accounting audience share  unit of accounting revenue share and discount rate 
each of these assumptions may change in the future based upon changes in general economic conditions  audience behavior  consummated transactions  and numerous other variables that may be beyond our control 

table of contents the projections incorporated into our annual license valuations take into consideration the prolonged economic recession and credit crisis  which has led to a further weakened  deteriorating and less profitable radio marketplace with reduced potential for growth and a higher cost of capital 
between its december  annual impairment assessment and its august  interim assessment  the company incorporated several more conservative estimates into its assumptions to reflect the deterioration in both the us economy and the radio marketplace 
specifically  long term revenue growth estimates generally decreased  from a range of to in the december  assessment to a range of to in the august  assessment 
similarly  as a large portion of radio s expenses are of a fixed nature  declining revenue projections negatively impact operating profit margin assumptions 
operating profit margins decreased from a range of to in the december  assessment to a range of to in the december  assessment 
assumptions incorporated into the annual impairment testing as of december  were similar to those used in our august  interim testing  although revenue growth rates were slightly higher as a result of the pace of the industry s recent revenue recovery 
below are some of the key assumptions used in our annual and interim impairment assessments 
the methodology used to value our fcc licenses has not changed in the three year period ended february  december  october  december  august  december  discount rate long term revenue growth rate years revenue growth rate all years mature market share operating profit margin valuation of goodwill asc topic requires the company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
the company conducts the two step impairment test on december of each fiscal year  unless indications of impairment exist during an interim period 
when assessing its goodwill for impairment  the company uses an enterprise valuation approach to determine the fair value of each of the company s reporting units radio stations grouped by market and magazines on an individual basis 
management determines enterprise value for each of its reporting units by multiplying the two year average station operating income generated by each reporting unit current year based on actual results and the next year based on budgeted results by an estimated market multiple 
the company uses a blended station operating income trading multiple of publicly traded radio operators as a benchmark for the multiple it applies to its radio reporting units 
there are no publicly traded publishing companies that are focused predominantly on city and regional magazines as is our publishing segment 
therefore  the market multiple used as a benchmark for our publishing reporting units is based on recently completed transactions within the city and regional magazine industry or analyst reports that include valuations of magazine divisions within publicly traded media conglomerates 
for the interim assessment performed as of august   the company applied a market multiple of times and times the reporting unit s operating performance for our radio and publishing reporting units  respectively 
for the annual assessment performed as of december   the company applied a market multiple of times and times the reporting unit s operating performance for our radio and publishing reporting units  respectively 
management believes this methodology for valuing radio and publishing properties is a common approach and believes that the multiples used in the valuation are reasonable given our peer comparisons and recent market transactions 
this enterprise valuation is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the reporting unit exhibits impairment  the company proceeds to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
for its step two testing  the enterprise value is allocated among the tangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets fcc licenses valued using a direct method valuation approach and unrecognized intangible assets  such as customer lists  with the residual amount representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
the methodology used to value our goodwill has not changed in the three year period ended february  sensitivity analysis based on the results of our december  annual impairment assessment  the fair value of our broadcasting licenses was approximately million which was in excess of the million carrying value by million  or 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of all of our units of accounting 
should our estimates or assumptions worsen  or should negative events or circumstances occur in the units that have limited fair value cushion  additional license impairments may be needed 

table of contents radio broadcasting licenses as of february  december  percentage by which fair unit of accounting carrying value fair value value exceeds carrying value new york cluster kxos fm los angeles austin cluster chicago cluster st 
louis cluster indianapolis cluster kpwr fm los angeles terre haute cluster total although our annual impairment testing on december  did not result in an impairment charge  if we were to assume a change in any of our three key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in local commercial share or an increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses on december   the resulting impairment charge would have been million  million and million  respectively 
also  if we were to assume a decrease in the two year average station operating income or a market multiple decrease of one  two of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our goodwill on december   the resulting impairment charge would have been million and million  respectively 
the prolonged economic downturn negatively impacted the radio broadcasting industry as advertising revenues continued to decline and expectations for growth over the next year also declined throughout most of calendar the projected revenue growth levels for the industry when we completed our interim impairment testing on august  were lower than we had originally forecasted when we completed our fiscal annual impairment test on december  this decline caused us to record further impairment to broadcasting licenses and goodwill as part of our august  impairment review 
as revenues decline  profitability levels are also negatively impacted as fixed costs represent a significant component of a radio station s operating expenses 
as a result  the fair value of our asset base is particularly sensitive to the impact of declining revenues 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the year in which the underlying transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts recorded for income tax purposes 
after determining the total amount of deferred tax assets  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and  respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation  employment liability  automotive liability and media liability claims 

table of contents valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company relies heavily upon historical data for its stock price when determining expected volatility  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments the transactions described below impact the comparability of operating results for the three years ended february  during the quarter ended may   emmis completed a series of transactions with its noncontrolling partners of two of our bulgarian radio networks that gave emmis ownership in those networks 
the purchase price of these transactions totaled million in cash  and a substantial portion was allocated to goodwill which was then determined to be substantially impaired 
emmis recorded an impairment loss of million related to bulgarian goodwill during the quarter ended may  on may   emmis sold the stock of its belgium radio operation to alfacam group nv  a belgian corporation  for euros 
emmis recognized a gain on the sale of its belgium radio operations of million  which included a gain of million related to the transfer of cumulative translation adjustments 
the gain on sale of the belgium radio operations is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
emmis desired to exit belgium as its financial performance in the market failed to meet expectations 
the sale allowed emmis to eliminate further operating losses 
on july   emmis completed the sale of its sole remaining television station  wvue tv in new orleans  la  to louisiana media company llc for million in cash 
the company recognized a loss on the sale of wvue tv of million  net of tax benefits of million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
in connection with the sale  the company paid discretionary bonuses to the employees of wvue tv totaling million  which is included in the calculation of the loss on sale 
the sale of wvue tv completes the sale of our television division which began on may   when emmis announced that it had engaged advisors to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives for its television assets 
on december   emmis completed its acquisition of of the shares of infopress company ood for million in cash 
infopress company ood operates inforadio  a national radio network broadcasting to bulgarian cities 
inforadio joins emmis majority owned bulgarian radio networks radio fm and radio fresh 
emmis believes the acquisition of inforadio further strengthens its footprint in bulgaria 
the operating results of inforadio from december  are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
on july   emmis completed its acquisition of orange coast kommunications  inc  publisher of orange coast  for million in cash including acquisition costs of million 
approximately million of the purchase price was withheld at the original closing  but was subsequently paid in april orange coast fits emmis niche of publishing quality city and regional magazines and serves the affluent area of orange county  ca

emmis recorded a gain on sale of million  net of tax  which is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
on march   emmis closed on its sale of kmtv tv in omaha  ne to journal communications  inc journal and received million in cash 
journal had been operating kmtv tv under a local programming and marketing agreement since december  
table of contents results of operations year ended february  compared to year ended february  net revenues for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net revenues radio publishing total net revenues radio net revenues decreased principally as a result of the precipitous decline of advertising spending in our domestic and international radio markets due to the global recession 
we typically monitor the performance of our domestic radio stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate based on reports for the periods prepared by the independent accounting firm miller kaplan 
miller kaplan reports are generally prepared on a gross revenue basis and exclude revenues from barter arrangements  and also exclude revenue emmis recognized related to the guaranteed minimum amount of national sales by our national representation firm as discussed below 
for the year ended february   revenues of our domestic radio stations were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that revenues of our domestic radio markets were down 
the relative underperformance of our domestic radio stations is principally due to our lack of scale in the new york and los angeles markets and the introduction of ppm tm to those markets in october market weakness and our stations weakness has led us to discount our rates charged to advertisers 
in fiscal  our average unit rate was down and our number of units sold was up 
the company s national representation firm guaranteed a minimum amount of national sales for the years ended february  and february  actual national sales  as defined by the representation agreement  were approximately million lower than the guaranteed minimum amount of national sales and the national representation firm has paid the shortfall to emmis 
as such  emmis recognized million of additional net revenues for the year ended february  emmis recognized million of additional net revenues related to the national representation firm s shortfall during the year ended february  our agreement with our national representation firm does not contain guarantees for any period after the year ended february  publishing net revenues decreased principally due to the global recession that diminished demand for advertising inventory at all of our city regional publications 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense radio publishing total station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense 
table of contents radio station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  decreased principally due to division wide cost reduction efforts consisting  among other things  of headcount and wage reductions 
these cost reduction efforts as well as lower sales related costs contributed to the reduction in station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense 
publishing operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  decreased principally due to division wide cost reduction efforts similar to our radio division 
most of our cost reduction efforts occurred at the beginning of fiscal  consequently  we do not anticipate similar year over year declines in station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  for the radio or publishing divisions in fiscal corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense corporate expenses decreased principally due to cost reduction efforts primarily consisting of headcount reductions and wage reductions  eliminating operating costs associated with the company s corporate aircraft  which was sold during the three months ended may   lower noncash compensation costs related to the discontinuance of the company s k matching program and lower black scholes valuations related to the company s march equity grants

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  emmis purchased the remaining ownership interests of its two majority owned radio networks in bulgaria 
emmis now owns of all three radio networks in bulgaria 
approximately million of the purchase price related to these acquisitions was allocated to goodwill  which was then determined to be substantially impaired 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we performed an interim impairment test of our intangible assets as indicators of impairment were present 
in connection with the interim review  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to our radio fcc licenses  million related to goodwill at our los angeles magazine publication  million related to definite lived intangibles at our orange coast magazine publication and million related to our bulgarian foreign broadcast licenses 
we performed our annual impairment testing as of december   but did not record any additional impairment charges 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands depreciation and amortization radio publishing corporate total depreciation and amortization the decrease in radio and publishing depreciation and amortization mostly relates to impairment charges related to our definite lived intangible assets at our bulgarian radio operation and our orange coast publication in connection with our interim impairment testing performed on august  corporate depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a significant portion of the corporate property and equipment became fully depreciated at the end of fiscal operating loss for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands operating loss radio publishing corporate total operating loss the decrease in operating loss is primarily due to lower year over year impairment losses

table of contents the august amendment to our credit agreement increased the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement by 
this increase is offset by lower outstanding debt during most of fiscal as a result of our dutch auction tenders  which are discussed below in gain on debt extinguishment 
gain on debt extinguishment for the years ended february  change as reported  amounts in thousands gain on debt extinguishment in april  emmis commenced a series of dutch auction tenders to purchase term loans of eoc under the credit agreement as amended 
the cumulative effect of all of the debt tenders resulted in the purchase of million in face amount of eoc s outstanding term loans for million in cash 
as a result of these purchases  emmis recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of million in the quarter ended may   which is net of transaction costs of million and a write off of deferred debt costs associated with the term loan reduction of million 
the credit agreement as amended permitted the company to pay up to million less amounts paid after february  under our tv proceeds quarterly bonus program to purchase eoc s outstanding term loans through tender offers and required a minimum offer of million per tender 
since the company paid million in debt tenders and paid million under the tv bonus program in march  we are not permitted to effect further tenders under the credit agreement 
in august  emmis further amended its credit agreement 
as part of the august amendment  maximum availability under the revolver was reduced from million to million

among other things  the second amendment suspends the applicability of the total leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants each as defined in the credit agreement for a period that will end no later than september  the suspension period  provides that during the suspension period  the borrower must maintain minimum consolidated ebitda as defined by the credit agreement for the trailing twelve month periods as follows period ending amount in s august  november  february  may  august  november  february  may  august  provides that during the suspension period  the borrower will not permit liquidity as defined in the credit agreement as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the borrower ending during the suspension period to be less than million  reduces the total revolving credit commitment as defined in the credit agreement from million to million  sets the applicable margin at per annum for base rate loans and at per annum for eurodollar rate loans  provides that during the suspension period  the borrower must make certain prepayments from funds attributable to debt or equity issuances  asset sales and extraordinary receipts  and must make quarterly payments of suspension period excess cash as defined in the credit agreement  provides that during the suspension period  the borrower may not make certain investments or effect material acquisitions  make certain restricted payments including but not limited to restricted payments to fund equity repurchases or dividends on emmis series a cumulative convertible preferred stock  or access the additional financing provisions of the credit agreement though borrower has access to the total revolving credit commitment of million  excludes from the definition of consolidated ebitda up to an additional million in severance and contract termination expenses incurred after the effective date of the second amendment  grants the lenders a security interest in certain previously excluded real estate and other assets  permits the repurchase of debt under the credit agreement at a discount using proceeds of certain equity issuances  and modifies certain financial definitions and other restrictions on ecc and the borrower 

table of contents the second amendment contains other terms and conditions customary for financing arrangements of this nature 
as discussed above  during the suspension period the company must maintain a minimum amount of trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and at least million in liquidity as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also contains certain other non financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants as of february  our liquidity as defined in the credit agreement as of february  was our minimum consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement requirement and actual amount as of february  was as follows as of february  actual trailing covenant twelve month requirement consolidated ebitda trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the company continually projects its anticipated cash needs  which include its operating needs  capital needs  principal and interest payments on its indebtedness and preferred stock dividends 
as of the filing of this form k  management believes the company can meet its liquidity needs through the end of fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents on hand  projected cash flows from operations and  to the extent necessary  through its borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  which was approximately million at february  based on these projections  management also believes the company will be in compliance with its debt covenants through the end of fiscal year however  continued global economic challenges  or other unforeseen circumstances  such as those described in item a risk factors  may negatively impact the company s operations beyond those assumed in its projections 
management considered the risks that the current economic conditions may have on its liquidity projections  as well as the company s ability to meet its debt covenant requirements 
if economic conditions deteriorate to an extent that we could not meet our liquidity needs or it appears that noncompliance with debt covenants is likely to result  the company would implement several remedial measures  which could include further operating cost and capital expenditure reductions  ceasing to operate certain unprofitable properties and the sale of assets 
if these measures are not successful in maintaining compliance with our debt covenants  the company would attempt to negotiate for relief through a further amendment with its lenders or waivers of covenant noncompliance  which could result in higher interest costs  additional fees and reduced borrowing limits 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining relief from its debt covenant requirements in these circumstances 
failure to comply with our debt covenants and a corresponding failure to negotiate a favorable amendment or waivers with the company s lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all the company s outstanding debt  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial position 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolver borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service requirements and the repayment of debt 
we also have used capital to fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 
in april  emmis commenced a series of dutch auction tenders to purchase term loans of eoc under the credit agreement as amended 
the cumulative effect of all of the debt tenders resulted in the purchase of million in face amount of eoc s outstanding term loans for million in cash 
the credit agreement as amended permitted the company to pay up to million less amounts paid after february  under our tv proceeds quarterly bonus program to purchase eoc s outstanding term loans through tender offers and required a minimum offer of million per tender 
since the company paid million in debt tenders and paid million under the tv bonus program in march  we are not permitted to effect further tenders under the credit agreement  other than as allowed for in the second amendment 

table of contents on march   ecc and its principal operating subsidiary  emmis operating company eoc  entered into the first amendment and consent to amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement the first amendment by and among ecc  emmis operating company and bank of america  na  as administrative agent for itself and other lenders  to the amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement  dated november  the credit agreement 
among other things  the first amendment i permits emmis to purchase a portion of the tranche b term loan as defined in the credit agreement at an amount less than par for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million  ii reduces the total revolving credit commitment as defined in the credit agreement from million to million  iii excludes from consolidated operating cash flow as defined in the credit agreement up to million in cash severance and contract termination expenses incurred for the period commencing march  and ending february   iv makes revolving credit loans as defined in the credit agreement subject to a pro forma incurrence test and v tightens the restrictions on the ability of emmis to perform certain activities  including restricting the amount that can be used to fund our tv proceeds quarterly bonus program  and of emmis operating company to conduct transactions with affiliates 
emmis previously announced that it had engaged blackstone advisory services lp to provide financial advisory services as the company explored a possible further amendment to the credit agreement or a possible restructuring of certain liabilities 
in may  emmis and blackstone advisory services lp terminated the financial advisory services agreement as emmis concluded that neither action was necessary at that time 
however  emmis may re engage blackstone or another financial advisory services firm from time to time as conditions warrant 
on august   emmis board of directors authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which emmis is authorized to purchase up to an aggregate value of million of its outstanding class a common stock within the parameters of sec rule b common stock repurchase transactions may occur from time to time at our discretion  either on the open market or in privately negotiated purchases  subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations 
on may   emmis board of directors revised the share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of both class a common stock and series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
during the year ended february   the company repurchased million shares for million average price of per share 
no common stock repurchases pursuant to this program were made during the years ended february  or at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
cash and cash equivalents held at various european banking institutions at february  and was million which includes approximately million of cash related to our slager discontinued operation which is classified as current assets discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and million  respectively 
our ability to access our share of these international cash balances net of noncontrolling interests is limited by country specific statutory requirements 
during the year ended february   working capital decreased million 
the decrease in net working capital primarily relates to the cash used to fund our dutch auction tenders during the period 
since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for a discussion of specific segment needs 
the company has entered into three separate three year interest rate exchange agreements  whereby the company pays a fixed rate of notional principal in exchange for a variable rate on the same amount of notional principal based on the three month libor 
the counterparties to these agreements are global financial institutions 
operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to a decrease in net revenues  net of station operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense  of million coupled with a decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations of million 
these decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in cash provided by working capital  which was up approximately million 
the increase in cash provided by working capital was largely driven by the receipt of million related to our national representation firm s performance guarantee and the collection of million for the first two years of lma fees for kmvn fm 
investing activities for the year ended february   cash provided by investing activities of million mostly relate to the company s sale of wvue tv for million in cash which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
approximately million of capital expenditures relate to the company s purchase of an airplane that it was previously leasing 

table of contents for the year ended february   cash used in investing activities of million consisting of million of capital expenditures and million paid to purchase the noncontrolling interests share of our bulgarian radio networks  both of which were partially offset by million of cash received from the sale of property and equipment million of which related to our airplane purchased in the prior year and sold in the current year 
in the years ended february  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to hd radio technology 
our capital expenditures for the year ended february  include the million purchase of our corporate jet  which was previously leased 
we exercised our early buyout option on the jet and immediately began marketing it for sale 
we closed on the sale of the corporate jet on april  and received million in cash 
we recognized a million impairment loss on the corporate jet as its carrying value  which included million of previously capitalized major maintenance costs  exceeded its fair value as of february  we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit agreement 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended february  primarily relate to the net long term debt repayments of million  payment of million of debt related fees and million used to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests million of which is related to slager and thus classified as discontinued operations 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended february  primarily relate to the million of net long term debt repayments  million used to pay preferred stock dividends and million used to pay cash distributions to noncontrolling interests million of which is related to slager and thus classified as discontinued operations 
as of february   emmis had million of borrowings under its senior credit facility million current and million long term and million of preferred stock outstanding 
all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility including our interest rate exchange agreements was approximately 
the debt service requirements of emmis over the next twelve month period excluding interest under our credit facility are expected to be million for repayment of term notes under our credit agreement 
although the credit agreement bears interest at variable rates  we have entered into three separate interest rate exchange agreements that effectively fix the rate we will pay on substantially all of the debt outstanding under our credit agreement 
interest that emmis will be required to pay related to the interest rate exchange agreements plus the applicable margin of under the credit agreement over the next twelve months is expected to be million 
our million notional amount interest rate exchange agreement matured on march  interest to be paid on credit agreement debt outstanding that is in excess of our interest rate exchange agreements is not presently determinable given that the credit agreement bears interest at variable rates 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october emmis has not declared a preferred stock dividend since october  as of february   cumulative preferred dividends in arrears total million 
failure to pay the dividend is not a default under the terms of the preferred stock 
however  since dividends have remain unpaid for more than six quarters  the holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect two persons to our board of directors 
no nominations for these director positions were submitted for the annual meeting of shareholders 
thus  the two director positions will remain vacant until the next meeting of shareholders  unless the annual meeting is delayed for such a time as to trigger the right of the holders of the preferred stock to submit new nominations in accordance with our bylaws 
the second amendment to our credit agreement prohibits the company from paying dividends on the preferred stock during the suspension period as defined in the credit agreement see liquidity and capital resources 
payment of future preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors 

table of contents at april   we had million available for additional borrowing under our credit facility  which is net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
availability under the credit facility depends upon our continued compliance with certain operating covenants and financial ratios 
emmis was in compliance with these covenants as of february  as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions  dispositions and swaps of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses  striving to maintain a portfolio that we believe leverages our strengths and holds promise for long term appreciation in value 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
as previously discussed  the second amendment to the credit agreement precludes us from making material acquisitions during the suspension period 
in addition  emmis currently has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our partner s entire interest in the austin radio partnership based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
the option  which does not expire  has not been exercised 
intangibles as of february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our domestic radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
our various foreign broadcasting licenses in slovakia and bulgaria expire in january and february we will need to submit applications to seek to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the fasb accounting standards codification as a single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the company s adoption of the codification during the quarter ended november  did not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  an accounting standard was approved  which sets forth the period  circumstances and disclosure after the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 
the company s adoption of the standard during the quarter ended august  and subsequent amendments to the standard issued in february did not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  an accounting standard was issued which requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods that were previously only required in annual financial statements 
the company s adoption of this accounting standard  which was effective for the company for the period ended august   did not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  an accounting standard was approved which provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
this accounting standard was adopted by the company on march  and had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  an accounting standard was approved which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting  and therefore need to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
this accounting standard was adopted by the company on march  and had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities were changed

table of contents in december  an accounting standard was approved which changed the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which are now characterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
this accounting standard  adopted by the company on march   required retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests  with all other requirements applied prospectively

in february  this accounting standard was again modified to allow an exception to the recognition and fair value measurement principles of contingencies in a business combination 
this exception requires that acquired contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
these modifications were effective for the company as of march  for all business combinations that close on or after march  as of february   the adoption of this standard has had no impact on the company 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since a significant portion of our senior bank debt is comprised of variable rate debt
