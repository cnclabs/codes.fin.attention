item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations and financial condition overview we are a global market leader in design  development  manufacture  sale and support of commercial jetliners  military aircraft  satellites  missile defense  human space flight and launch systems and services 
we are one of the two major manufacturers of seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the us while our principal operations are in the us  we rely extensively on a network of partners  key suppliers and subcontractors around the world 
our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses commercial airplanes and boeing defense  space security bds supplemented and supported by boeing capital corporation bcc 
taken together  these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace 
we focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality 
bds integrates its resources in defense  intelligence  communications  security and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs 
our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets  underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity 
our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset 
bcc delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure 
consolidated results of operations revenues dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing capital corporation other segment unallocated items and eliminations total revenues in increased by  million due to higher revenues in commercial airplanes and bds 
commercial airplanes revenues increased by  primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in deliveries in were lower as a result of a labor strike in the prior year 
increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues 
bds revenues increased by  million  primarily due to higher revenues in global services support gs s and boeing military airplanes bma  partially offset by decreases in network space systems n ss 
bcc revenues decreased by million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio 
other segment revenues decreased by million partly due to higher revenues in the prior year from the sale of four c aircraft held under operating lease 
lower unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by million primarily due to lower p a poseidon program p a intercompany revenues recognized by commercial airplanes in compared with 
table of contents the decrease in revenues of  million compared with  is primarily due to lower revenues at commercial airplanes 
commercial airplanes revenues decreased by  million  primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike  partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre strike deliveries and model mix 
we delivered fewer airplanes than expected during due to the strike 
this reduced revenue by approximately billion for the twelve months ended december  bds revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in gs s was offset by decreases in bma and n ss 
bcc revenues decreased by million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio 
other segment revenues increased by million primarily due to the sale of four c aircraft during  that were held under an operating lease 
unallocated items and eliminations changed by million  primarily due to the intercompany elimination of p a revenues recognized by commercial airplanes 
earnings from operations the following table summarizes our earnings loss from operations dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing capital corporation other segment unallocated items and eliminations total operating earnings in decreased by  million compared with commercial airplanes earnings decreased by  million primarily due to  million of costs related to the first three flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in august that these aircraft could not be sold 
the earnings decrease is also attributable to reach forward losses on the program which grew by  million in which is an increase of million over lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower earnings 
these decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in compared with bds earnings increased by million compared with primarily due to higher earnings in the bma segment partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment 
bcc operating earnings decreased million reflecting lower revenues  higher impairment expense and a provision for losses  partially offset by lower interest expense 
other segment losses decreased by million primarily due to recognition of pre tax expense of million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year 
unallocated items and eliminations in reduced earnings by million compared with  which is further explained in the table below 
operating earnings in decreased by  million compared with commercial airplanes earnings decreased by  million compared with the same period in  primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike  increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on and  and a charge taken on the program 
commercial airplanes research and development expense decreased by million to  million compared with the same period in  primarily due to lower spending on partially offset by higher spending on and lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
bds earnings decreased by million compared with primarily due to lower earnings in the bma segment resulting from charges taken on the airborne early warning and control aew c 
bcc operating 
table of contents earnings decreased million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense 
unallocated items and eliminations in improved by million compared with  which is further explained in the table below 
the most significant items included in unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  share based plans expense deferred compensation expense income other unallocated items and eliminations pension postretirement total the reduction in share based plans expense in is primarily due to the expiration of certain performance shares during and higher expense acceleration during  resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in deferred compensation expense increased by million in and decreased by million in the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions 
other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by million in primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations  elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment in the same periods of the prior year 
other unallocated items and expense in includes a charge related to satellite litigation of million  offset by lower performance based compensation in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and other unallocated items and eliminations 
dollars in millions pension other postretirement benefits years ended december  allocated to business segments other unallocated items and eliminations total 
table of contents other earnings items dollars in millions years ended december  earnings from operations other expense income  net interest and debt expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations other income decreased by million and million in and the decreases are primarily driven by a reduction in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances 
interest and debt expense increased by million compared with due to additional debt issued in for a discussion related to income taxes  see note backlog our backlog at december was as follows dollars in millions contractual backlog commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing military aircraft network space systems global services support total boeing defense  space security total contractual backlog unobligated backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and us government contract funding 
the decrease in contractual backlog during was due to deliveries in excess of orders  changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders 
the increase in backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our   and programs 
unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding have not been authorized 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is primarily due to decreases at bds of  million compared with partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the us army of the brigade combat team modernization bctm formerly the future combat systems fcs system development and demonstration contract relating to manned ground vehicles and associated systems and equipment 
approved funding of existing multi year contracts including the bctm  v  chinook  proprietary and ground based midcourse defense gmd programs also reduced unobligated backlog 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is primarily due to decreases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts including the f a  bctm and f programs 
these decreases were partially offset by multi year procurement contracts awarded on the v and chinook programs 

table of contents segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment and were extremely challenging for the world s airlines as key external business factors oil prices  economic growth  exchange rates  financing terms experienced high levels of volatility 
in the first half of  airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to barrel 
in autumn  the airlines focus shifted to the fallout of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below barrel for the first time since  and in passenger and cargo traffic experienced their worst ever declines 
this business environment curtailed the airline industry profit recovery that started in as a result  the global airline industry has now reported losses in seven out of the last ten years  and over airlines have entered bankruptcy since the beginning of in this challenging environment  airlines are adapting their operations to meet the realities of the markets in which they operate 
airlines reduced global passenger capacity by in through a combination of frequency and route cuts in unprofitable markets  lower daily airplane utilization flight hours per day and parking scrapping of older generation airplanes 
airlines are also replacing older less fuel efficient airplanes  reducing non fuel costs and finding new ways to partner through alliances or via mergers and acquisitions 
these conditions have caused customers to request cancellations  modifications  or rescheduling of their existing orders and advance payment schedules to meet revised fleet plans or address financing and cash flow issues 
whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings  cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted  the type of aircraft  how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled  modified  or rescheduled 
near term global airline industry indicators are improving although many uncertainties persist 
global economic recovery has begun 
although it is expected to vary significantly by region both in terms of speed and magnitude  world economic growth is forecast to grow moderately in following contraction in as a result  airline industry forecasts generally indicate global passenger traffic returning close to levels in with many emerging markets posting growth over air cargo traffic is forecast to grow above the long term trend rates in following two years of contraction which have taken traffic back to and levels 
due to these improving demand conditions  airlines are expected to see significantly smaller financial losses globally in beyond the near term market uncertainties  the long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks such as avian or hn flus  terrorism and increased global environmental regulations 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in 
table of contents europe and asia has enabled low cost airlines to continue gaining market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately of commercial airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with us airlines 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china and japan are likely to enter the to seat aircraft market over the next few years 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
a decline of the us dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in the second half of puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits 
competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings  a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through if the us dollar strengthens again  airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development  gain market share through pricing and or improve earnings 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues loss earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog 
table of contents revenues year over year changes in revenue are shown in the following table dollars in millions vs 
vs 
new airplane sales aircraft trading commercial aviation services business total the increase in revenue of  million in from is primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues 
prior year revenues were negatively impacted by the iam strike 
the decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions 
the decrease in revenue of  million in from is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries 
the iam strike resulted in airplane deliveries moving out of which reduced revenues by  million 
the strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of million  and higher pre strike deliveries  net of model mix changes  of million 
aircraft trading activity decreased by million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft 
revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions 
commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december  were as follows total cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries intercompany deliveries included five aircraft in  two aircraft and two aircraft in and one aircraft and one aircraft in earnings from operations earnings from operations for decreased by  million when compared to  primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of  million related to the three flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory as of july  additional production costs incurred between august and december of million related to those flight test airplanes were also included in research and development expense 
those amounts were partially offset by a million decrease in other research and development expense 
the decrease in earnings is also attributable to reach forward losses on the program which grew by  million in compared with losses of million in the reach forward losses were primarily due to increased production costs  reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the lower commercial aviation services 
table of contents revenues and margins reduced earnings by million 
higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the and schedule delays announced in and and infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike reduced earnings by million 
increased period and other costs reduced earnings by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of  million related to new airplane deliveries 
earnings from operations decreased by  million in when compared to  with operating margins decreasing percentage points to 
lower new airplane deliveries  partially offset by higher intercompany revenues  reduced earnings by  million 
a charge for a reach forward loss on the program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of derivatives reduced earnings by million 
infrastructure cost allocations related to the and schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike reduced earnings by million 
the and schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on deliveries  while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year 
increased period and other costs reduced earnings by million 
a reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix related earnings of million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs 
lower research and development costs improved earnings by million 
backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before boeing and the customer are required to perform 
backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain  such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors  shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements 
all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain 
firm orders exclude options 
a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
however  once orders are included in firm backlog  orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled  although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers 
the decrease in contractual backlog during was due to deliveries in excess of orders  changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders 
the increase in backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our   and programs 
accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts 
it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which does not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates 
this has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 

table of contents the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the table below provides details as of december program program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders the accounting quantity for the program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery  targeted for undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to december  cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during due to the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
production rates remained unchanged in program there was no change in the accounting quantity for the program during in  we recorded a charge of million to recognize a reach forward loss 
the charge was primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers 
during  additional charges of  million were recorded to recognize reach forward losses 
during the first quarter of  we recorded million of a reach forward loss due to a reduction in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and an increase in estimated costs due to our decisions to reduce twin aisle production rates which impact production rates beginning in during the third quarter of we increased the reach forward loss on the program by  million 
of this amount  million was caused by higher estimated production costs  including both additional internal production costs and higher supplier expenses  attributable to greater than expected re work and disruption in manufacturing due to late maturity of engineering designs as well as the limited availability of engineering resources 
the remaining million was primarily due to challenging cargo market conditions and our related decision to defer a planned increase in the production rate  which drove higher allocations of fixed costs and caused us to incur volume based penalties to suppliers 
first flight of the freighter is expected to occur during the first quarter of  with the flight test program expected to take place in first delivery of the freighter is expected in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of first delivery of the intercontinental passenger variant remains scheduled for the fourth quarter of the gap between the delivery of the last  which occurred in  and first deliveries of the will result in lower program revenues 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during in april  we announced a delay in previous plans to increase the production rate 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during delivery of the first freighter occurred in february in april  we announced that we will lower the production rate on our airplane program  affecting deliveries beginning in june this lower production rate will decrease revenues and earnings in and program we announced on june  the necessity to reinforce an area of structure at the side of body section of the airplane 
during the fourth quarter  we completed the modifications on the first two flight test airplanes and the full scale static test airplane 
first flight of the occurred on december  a second completed its first test flight on december  six aircraft in total will be involved in the flight test program  which is expected to result in certification of the in the fourth quarter of first delivery is also expected to occur in the fourth quarter of we continue to work toward our planned increases in production rates as well as the timely introduction of the derivative 
during  we concluded that the first three flight test aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft 
as a result  costs of  million previously recorded as program inventory as of july  were reclassified to research and development expense 
additional production costs incurred between august and december of million related to these flight test airplanes were also included in research and development expense 
we will continue to incur research and development costs on these flight test aircraft in we believe that the other three additional flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at december  if we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold we may incur additional charges 
on july   we acquired the business  assets and operations of vought aircraft industries  inc s vought business conducted at north charleston  south carolina 
the facility produces aft fuselage sections  including the fabrication  assembly and systems installation 
see note on december   we acquired alenia north america s ownership interest in global aeronautica 
as a result of the transaction  we are the sole owner of this entity 
located adjacent to boeing charleston  global aeronautica is an integrator of the mid fuselage sections 
on october  we announced the north charleston facility as the location for a second final assembly site for the dreamliner program 
a groundbreaking ceremony was held november  to mark the start of construction 
until the additional assembly line is fully operational  we will establish transitional surge capability at our everett  washington  location to facilitate the planned introduction of the  the first derivative model of the family 
when the additional line in north charleston is fully operational  the surge capability in everett will be phased out 
looking beyond first flight  we continue to monitor and address other areas of challenge associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain  completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration 
efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft 

table of contents we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes including delivery delays and supplier assertions 
a number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and or performance 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth 
the cumulative impacts of the flight test delays  production challenges  schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts create significant pressure on program revenue and cost estimates 
we continue to assess our mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to address these pressures 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
logo our research and development expense increased by  million in this was due to reclassification to research and development expense of  million of production costs related to the three flight test aircraft and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments  partially offset by a million decrease of other research and development expense 
our research and development expense decreased million in research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers 
the decrease in research and development spending for was primarily due to reduced product development activities partially offset by million of increased spending on the program and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
additional considerations the and programs highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes  particularly as both the and the begin the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development 
costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred 
costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting 
airplane programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity 
generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery 
each customer purchase 
table of contents agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery 
a price escalation formula based on pre defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs  utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners 
as technical or quality issues arise  such as issues experienced on the and programs  we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft 
additionally  price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future 
there are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach forward losses 
these include changes to the program accounting quantity  production costs and rates  capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity  learning curve  anticipated cost reductions  flight test and certification schedules  costs and schedule for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims  supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations 
while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  order cancellations or other financially significant exposure 
boeing defense  space security business environment and trends on january   we announced that integrated defense systems will begin operating under the name boeing defense  space security bds 
bds consists of three capabilities driven businesses boeing military aircraft bma  network space systems n ss and global services support gs s 
additionally  bds phantom works supports all three businesses via product development  rapid prototyping and customer engagement through experimentation and enterprise technology investment strategies 
defense environment overview the us continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense  natural disasters  stabilization efforts  counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations  or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means 
the us department of defense us dod faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important capabilities and transform the force to meet the changing national security as articulated in the quadrennial defense review 
all of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis and healthcare reform 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment 
government policies are impacting the defense environment including defense acquisition reform  more insourcing  concerns over industrial base  a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances 
although the us dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  we expect the total budget growth rate to level off over the next several years due to shifting priorities and budget pressures 
the fiscal year discretionary budget request of billion includes an overseas contingency operations oco budget of billion  with an additional billion requested 
the fiscal year discretionary budget of billion includes oco budget of billion 
procurement is expected to increase  while research and development accounts decrease  facing increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from operations and maintenance o m and personnel costs tied to us commitments overseas 
however  this trend is partially offset by 
table of contents equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development 
the near term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the to period for investment efforts 
though opportunities may exist following us troop draw downs in iraq  they are offset by recent increases in afghanistan 
we continue to see pressure to reduce oco requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars 
it is unlikely that the us dod will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives 
this imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the us dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs 
we expect the us dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition reform and emphasizing utilization of commercial off the shelf solutions and network enabled operations 
these strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  cyber security  and precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons  electronic warfare  as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
other nations continue to experience growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements  aging inventories  and changing threat environments 
greater us reliance on allies and coalition partners places additional pressure on nations to emphasize acquisition of material that is deployable  survivable  and interoperable with the international community 
european nations are struggling to meet defense investment needs as budget deficits create greater pressure on resources 
though regional financial concerns exist  middle eastern military markets remain robust with stable oil prices and persistent regional security concerns sustaining continued defense investment 
in asia  growth is slowing with nations pursuing select acquisitions to address growing regional threats 
the international market will continue to be affected by global economic challenges 
however  the continuing threat environment should keep demand stable in missile defense environment the proliferation of short and medium range ballistic missiles is considered the greatest current threat to security and is driving missile defense spending 
as a result  the near term focus for growth is in regional and tactical bmd systems 
civil space transportation and exploration environment the national aeronautics and space administration nasa budget is focused on technology development and demonstration programs  the international space station  and new initiatives associated with space exploration 
nasa is developing new approaches to space exploration with added emphasis on commercial spaceflight systems  space technology development and robotic missions 
nasa is also enhancing its focus on climate change and aeronautics research 
homeland security environment the continuing threat from terrorism is the key driver for the homeland security market 
key growth areas include aviation security  border security  maritime security and cyber security 
additionally  the us government is focused on increasing cooperation with state and local institutions 
commercial satellite environment the commercial satellite market is experiencing improvement in market demand  partly driven by strong us government demand for commercial satellite systems and services  but the overall sector continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing 
adjacent market environment we see growth opportunities across a number of adjacent markets with both us dod and other us government customers 
these markets  including services  unmanned systems  intelligence  cyber  and energy  represent key development areas which support the current engagements overseas as well as emerging national security issues 

table of contents services growth in services is anticipated both domestically and internationally  as customers have a wide variety of needs  including information services  platform related services  facility management  infrastructure services and logistics command and control 
unmanned systems the unmanned market continues to see growth in all classes of platforms due to the high demand from the us military in southwest asia 
we anticipate this growth increasing as unmanned systems continue to provide critical mission functions to the war fighter with affordability  persistence  and accuracy 
intelligence we see the intelligence market growing based on the demands of data collection  dissemination  and analysis driven by the conflicts in southwest asia 
growth in data fusion  data management  and information sharing is expected as the use of isr assets increase 
cyber the demand for defensive  offensive  and exploit operations in the emerging cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers 
cyber threats from both state and non state actors represent a critical national security issue 
the us government is taking significant steps to mitigate the cyber threat to the us dod and to us critical infrastructure 
energy we anticipate the energy market will emerge with growth potential 
as energy volatility becomes more substantial  the need for energy management  infrastructure security  and scenario modeling will increase accordingly 
the us dod  including individual service branches  is also actively engaged in developing energy policy guidance and comprehensive plans from which to execute programs 
bds realignment effective january   and certain programs were realigned among bds segments 
in addition  effective january   certain environmental remediation contracts formerly included in n ss were transferred to the other segment

bds total backlog decreased in  from  million to  million  partly due to a partial termination for convenience from the us army of the bctm formerly fcs system development and demonstration contract relating to manned ground vehicles and associated systems and equipment 
current year deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years also contributed to the backlog reduction 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include airborne laser  ea g  family of beyond line of sight terminals fab t  bctm formerly fcs  gmd  joint tactical radio system jtrs  p a and proprietary programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of these programs include aew c  international kc tanker  commercial and military satellites  vigilare and high frequency modernisation

operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges on the aew c and international kc tanker programs 
bma earnings decreased by million in primarily due to charges taken on the aew c program 
delivery mix and lower volume also contributed to the decrease in research and development the bma segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge  technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter s enduring needs 
research and development expense in increased by over primarily due to proprietary programs which was partially offset by lower international tanker development costs 
research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility  precision effects  situational awareness and survivability 
investments in prototyping allow us to offer low risk programs to our customers 
the products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products 
investments support vertical integration of our product line in 
table of contents areas like autonomous operation of unmanned vehicles  advanced sensors and electronic warfare 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness  interoperability  reliability and reducing the cost of ownership

total backlog increased by in compared with primarily due to an increase in the v  chinook and f program backlog

additional considerations items which could have a future impact on bma operations include the following aew c during  and  we recorded charges increasing the reach forward losses on the aew c programs in australia and turkey by million  million and million  respectively 
the charge primarily related to delivery schedule delays 
the charge  primarily related to our program in australia  was due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing 
the aew c development program  also known as wedgetail in australia  peace eagle in turkey and peace eye in the republic of korea  consists of aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which have never been installed on an airplane before 
wedgetail includes six aircraft and peace eagle and peace eye include four aircraft each 
during the fourth quarter of  two wedgetail aircraft were provided to australia for familiarization and training 
wedgetail final delivery and customer acceptance is scheduled to begin in late and extend through the second quarter of these are advanced and complex fixed price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
we believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed 
international kc tanker program during  and  we recorded charges increasing the reach forward losses in the international kc tanker programs by million  million and million  respectively 
the charge was partially offset at the consolidated level 
the international kc tanker program includes four aircraft for the italian air force and four aircraft for the japanese air self defense force 
the final delivery to japan was made in december the italian international kc program is ongoing  and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed

additional considerations items which could have a future impact on n ss operations include the following united launch alliance on december   we and lockheed martin corporation lockheed created a joint venture named united launch alliance llc ula combines the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of boeing delta and lockheed atlas rockets 
we initially contributed net assets of million at december  the book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ula s net assets 
this difference is expensed ratably in future years 
based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ula  this amortization is expected to be approximately million annually for the next years 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and lockheed each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ula of up to million to support its working capital requirements during the year period following december  we and lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain us government contracts to ula as of the closing date 
we and lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the us government 
we and lockheed have also each committed to provide ula with up to million of additional capital contributions in the event ula does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement 
see note we agreed to indemnify ula through december  against potential non recoverability and non allowability of  million of boeing delta inventories included in contributed assets plus  million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on march  since inception  ula has consumed  million of inventories that were contributed by us and has made payments of million to us under the inventory supply agreement 
as part of its integration  ula is continuing to assess the future of the delta ii program beyond what is currently on contract 
in the event ula is unable to sell additional delta ii inventory  earnings could be reduced by up to million 
we agreed to indemnify ula against potential losses that ula may incur in the event ula is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the us air force usaf for four satellite missions 
we believe ula is entitled to additional contract pricing 
in december  ula submitted a claim to the usaf to re price the contract value for two of the four satellite missions covered by the indemnification 
in march  the usaf issued a denial of that claim and in june  ula filed an appeal 
during  the usaf exercised its option for a third satellite mission 
ula intends to submit a claim to the usaf in to re price the contract value of the third mission 
if ula is unsuccessful obtaining additional pricing we may be responsible for some of the shortfall and may record up to million in pre tax losses associated with the four missions 
business environment and trends during  we received a partial termination for convenience from the us army of the bctm formerly fcs system development and demonstration contract relating to manned ground vehicles and associated systems and equipment 
we believe the final restructured bctm contract will negatively impact revenue and earnings in the n ss segment going forward

table of contents boeing capital corporation business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million  which was substantially collateralized by boeing produced commercial aircraft 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among us commercial airline customers 
the weak global economic environment and capital market disruptions affected the availability of credit for the airline industry 
while sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during  bcc provided limited financing to certain boeing customers 
to the extent capital market conditions continue to improve  we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for bcc to provide financing 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service

capital resources we have substantial borrowing capacity 
any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants 
we and bcc have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity 
throughout and at december   neither we nor bcc had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
currently  we have  million  million exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements  of which  million is a year credit facility expiring in november and  million is a day revolving credit facility expiring in november both the year and day credit facilities have a one year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates 
in  we renewed the day revolving credit facility  of which million is allocated to bcc 
we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in on march   we filed a public shelf registration with the us securities and exchange commission for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and common stock 
in the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities  our commercial aircraft financing commitments  unfavorable resolution of loss contingencies  or other business requirements  we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt 
we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short term and long term commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
at this point in time  our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment  and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  under our commercial paper program  in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions

the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the credit agreements  and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital as defined 
when considering debt covenants  we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   and the estimated timing thereof

estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
in addition  the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  
table of contents property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
income tax obligations as of december   our total liability for income taxes payable  including uncertain tax positions  was  million  of which million we expect to pay in the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining million

table of contents commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order  under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates 
based on historical experience  we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers  however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required 
see note contingent obligations we have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business  which include the following legal various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against us 
legal contingencies are discussed in note  including our contesting the default termination of the a aircraft  litigation arbitration involving bssi programs and employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees 
environmental remediation we are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of million at december  for additional information  see note income taxes we have recorded a net liability of  million at december  for uncertain tax positions 
for further discussion of these contingencies  see note off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note critical accounting policies contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 

table of contents due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
a number of our contracts are in a reach forward loss position 
changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured part costs  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs  excluding the program  for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
the program is in a reach forward loss position 
absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs  subsequent deliveries are 
table of contents recorded at zero margin 
reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity  whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately 
aircraft valuation allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings  collateral values and default rates 
if each customer s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were higher or lower at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease  the allowance would have increased by million or decreased by million 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for re lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  lease residual values equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   this would result in a future cumulative pre tax earnings impact of approximately million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which approximately million would be recognized in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
april is our annual testing date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the 
table of contents amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
as of december  and  we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible assets 
postretirement plans substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans 
we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements require several assumptions 
significant assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense  projected benefit obligations and shareholders equity 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate as of december  dollars in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans projected benefit obligation net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
table of contents pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
a decrease or increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million 
differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year s pension cost 
the asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period 
despite investment gains during  the significant losses incurred during will cause net periodic pension cost for to increase by approximately million due to amortization of actuarial losses 
absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions  net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years 
the assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year s expense  recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change as of december  dollars in millions change in medical trend rate increase bps change in medical trend rate decrease bps other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with that of bcc s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates 
as of december   the impact to bcc s pre tax earnings of a basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be insignificant for the year ended december  historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes 
based on the portfolio of other boeing fixed rate debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by million 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency forward and option contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
