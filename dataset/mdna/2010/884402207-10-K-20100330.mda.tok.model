table of contents part i item business 
overview we are a professional services firm that executes and implements process improvements and culture change management operations strategies to produce improved operational and financial performance for our clients globally 
we are a delaware corporation founded in and headquartered in irving  texas 
through our proprietary process value management  or pvm  methodology  our consultants refine processes throughout an organization to give our clients a competitive advantage that increases revenues  lowers costs  and generates cash 
with our more than years of change management experience  innovation  and knowledge leadership  we have demonstrated our ability to apply this methodology in hundreds of clients in both the private and the public sector 
process value management is our proprietary methodology to identify  prioritize  and quantify the amount and timing of cross functional business improvement opportunities 
the pvm approach and methodology is designed to help an organization increase overall effectiveness by focusing on performance drivers throughout the organization like speed cycle time  quality first pass yield  and productivity 
the pvm approach and methodology is widely applicable to almost all types of enterprises  including government entities  military organizations  for profit companies in many industries  and not for profit enterprises  to help drive sustainable improvements in operations and reduced costs 
for marketing purposes  in we were organized into four practices 
these practices  which focus our marketing efforts into client industry sectors  are aerospace and defense contractors  government including all branches of the us military  healthcare  and transportation and logistics 
in the future we may create additional practices as we see potential market opportunities  or we may combine or eliminate practices in response to market conditions 
our practice leaders and principals are responsible for sales and marketing to prospective clients 
through the years  we have developed a number of service offerings that employ the pvm approach and methodology to drive productivity improvements within multiple areas of our clients enterprises 
although we continue to provide solutions to client problems in many areas of need  over the past two years we have refined our offerings to focus our marketing more often on specific solutions in culture and change management  finance and administration  marketing and sales  operations  product and service innovation  and supply chain management 

table of contents culture and change management our clients often seek our services and guidance to manage cultural and other changes within their organizations 
our services in this area involve changing basic values  norms  and beliefs among stakeholders in order to improve organizational performance 
sometimes the changes that an organization needs to make in order to improve processes and drive better performance are hindered by cultural barriers that are hidden and embedded in the organization s culture 
our culture change consultants use a proprietary methodology to allow the organization to determine if a barrier is related to a certain subject matter  process  or cultural position 
once identified  we assist the organization by using the techniques of process value management to implement the changes and new behaviors required throughout the change management process and implementation plan 
finance and administration we provide services that enable our clients finance and administration functions to improve performance  deliver enterprise wide profit improvement  and increase shareholder value 
we assist companies to redefine the role of finance and administration and transform it from a backward looking  number crunching organization to one that is future oriented and focused on providing value through deeper analysis and insight 
we use process value management to focus our clients finance and administration functions more on integrating processes end to end within the organization and extended through its outside network of key partners  suppliers  and customers 
in many cases  these efforts enable our clients to turn fixed costs into variable costs and reduce overall costs through efficient global transaction processing  with integrated processes and systems 
marketing and sales we provide services designed to enable our clients marketing and sales functions not only to increase cash flow  but also to control associated selling  general and administrative costs  streamline processes  and improve performance across all sales  marketing and service activities 
we employ our proprietary process value management methodology to help our clients increase overall marketing and sales effectiveness 
the pvm approach and methodology focuses on marketing and sales performance drivers like speed cycle time  quality first pass yield  and productivity 
operations we provide services designed to improve our clients operational processes to transform raw materials  labor and capital into finished goods and services 
by employing our process value management methodology  we help our clients improve their operations management throughout their organization by focusing on supply chain strategy  processes and supporting systems 
product and service innovation we provide our clients with product and service innovation solutions to reduce the time in which new ideas get turned into revenue by reducing time to market activities and corresponding costs 
our methodologies focus on the drivers of overall time to market performance speed cycle time  quality  and productivity 
this approach is designed to enable our clients to develop and implement well defined and aligned processes and procedures that increase product and service innovation program efficiency 

table of contents supply chain management we provide solutions and services that improve our clients ability to manage their supply chain 
supply chain management is the process of planning  implementing  and controlling operations of the supply chain while satisfying customer requirements as efficiently as possible 
the process includes all internal functions  the logistics  distribution  sourcing  customer service  sales  manufacturing  and finance departments of an organization 
however  it also involves external suppliers that provide finished products  components  parts and assemblies  and their delivery 
we have industry experience in supply chain transformation across multiple enterprises  including automotive  white goods  consumer goods  retail  machine tools  aerospace and defense  and many others 
we believe our pragmatic  performance oriented approach enables us to identify key improvement opportunities and deliver tangible results quickly 
well defined and aligned processes and procedures increase supply chain program efficiency 
our solutions focus on processes to improve results  whether focused on a single activity or an entire enterprise 
contractual arrangements and revenue recognition we perform services and provide solutions for clients pursuant to contracts that typically have terms of two weeks to one year or longer 
we are compensated for our professional services and solutions in one or more of three ways fixed fees  task based fees  or incentive fees 
our fee type and structure for each client engagement depends on a number of variables  including the size of the client  the complexity and geographic dispersion of its business  the extent of the opportunity for us to improve the client s processes and other factors 
some of our contracts are cancellable with little notice 
we do not report bookings or backlog because we believe the uncertainties associated with cancelable contracts  particularly in our commercial business  may render such information misleading 
the majority of our revenue is derived from fixed fee and task based fee contracts 
fixed fee revenue is recognized on the proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
in order to calculate the completion ratio on a given project  time and effort to date are divided by the total estimated time and effort for the entire project 
this ratio is then multiplied by the total fixed fee to be earned on the project  resulting in the amount of revenue earned to date 
a few of our fixed fee contracts  primarily assessments  are recognized using the completed contract performance model as these contracts are generally one to six weeks in duration and conclude with a presentation or agreed upon deliverable to the clients management 
revenues attributable to fixed fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
task based fees are recognized as revenue when the relevant task is completed  usually on a monthly basis 
revenues attributable to task based fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
incentive fees are tied to improvements in a variety of client performance measures typically involving cycle time  asset utilization and productivity 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related client improvements are achieved and we obtain the client s acceptance 
our 
table of contents incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis for the payment of incentive fees 
in order to mitigate the risk of disputes arising over the achievement of performance improvements  which drive incentive fees  we obtain customer agreement to these achievements prior to recognizing revenue 
typically these contracts are for commercial customers and they provide for a base fee and an additional incentive fee earned according to a formula in the contract 
incentive fees are affected by our clients business performance and prevailing economic conditions 
revenues attributable to incentive fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of march   we had no contractual agreements that included incentive fees 
while incentive fees are not currently a significant portion of our revenue  earlier in our history they were more significant 
as we attempt to diversify our business in the future to include more commercial work  incentive fees could again become a more significant portion of our revenue 
reimbursement revenue represents our clients repayment of our mutually agreed upon travel expenses as incurred 
all billable travel expenses are submitted to and approved by the client 
revenues attributable to reimbursement were  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for some clients  the fixed fee or task based fee is inclusive of travel 
in these cases  the travel expense is included in cost of sales 
consulting contracts typically are awarded by both government entities and private organizations on the basis of sole source negotiations  that is  direct negotiation between the client and a single vendor such as thomas group  or on the basis of competitive bidding  generally in response to a request for proposal  or rfp 
whenever possible  we prefer to work under sole source contract arrangements 
competitive bids can require extensive time  effort and cost to submit a qualified bid  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in many competitive bid situations  we compete against far larger companies with far greater resources to devote to the proposal process 
in some cases  we team with another company that has capabilities complementary to ours in order to increase the competitiveness of our bid 
in some other cases  we use an intermediary who has the capability to respond more effectively in this process 
for several years we worked extensively on engagements with two divisions of the us navy  each governed by a separate contractual agreement 
one of these contracts expired march  and the other expired april  for the year ended december  these two contracts represented approximately of our revenue  and for the year ended december  they represented approximately of our revenue 
to date  we have not replaced much of the revenue that was previously generated through these expired government contracts 
we continue to work on smaller programs with the us navy as well as with the us army 
we are actively working to expand our business with the entire us military as well as other departments within the us government 
contracts related to these us government engagements often are executed within the united states government s budget cycle and may be fully funded for up to one year at a time 
they may be renewed annually for successive one year periods if the life of the engagement extends beyond one fiscal year 
for our engagements with the us government  we contract either directly with the government through our listing with the general services administration or we use an intermediary that acts as a prime contractor providing contracting and administrative services for the majority of our government programs 
financial information about segments and geographic areas we operate in one industry segment 
additional financial information about our segment and information related to the geographic areas in which we operate appears in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents we currently do business in europe through an unaffiliated agent  carpe diem consulting gmbh  which uses our proprietary methods to sell and deliver services to clients in europe 
the contracts for these assignments are entered into directly between us and the client 
we are responsible for the fulfillment of the contract  and we bill the client directly 
we pay carpe diem consulting for the man days worked on the engagements by their personnel at a negotiated rate and share incentive fees  if any  earned from these engagements 
we conduct this business through thomas group global llc  a wholly owned delaware limited liability company 
from time to time  we also do business in other areas of the world in addition to the us and europe 
for example  during and we also performed services in south america 
clients historically  most of our clients have been large  diversified commercial or government enterprises in north america  europe  south america and asia 
for several years prior to may  however  the majority of our revenue was derived from engagements with the us navy  both directly and through an intermediary 
as discussed above  in march and april our two largest engagements with the us navy ended 
during the remainder of and  we added new clients  both with the us government and with commercial entities  but these engagements were not sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from our prior contracts for the us navy 
for  we are focused on diversifying our client base by delivering our solutions in north america  both to the us government and to commercial entities 
we also expect to engage in some business in europe  and perhaps elsewhere  on an opportunistic basis 
while we believe our methodologies are applicable to any organization  we have developed a significant amount of subject matter expertise relevant to specific industries and governmental entities 
consequently  we can leverage our consultants prior executive experiences to obtain business and determine appropriate client project teams 
our goal is to diversify our business among our various practice areas government  aerospace and defense contractors  transportation and logistics  and healthcare 
we are actively pursuing new business in each of these areas 
for the year ended december   the four clients who accounted for more than of our revenue were carl zeiss vision international gmbh  amtrak  mantech us navy and boston scientific 
competition the consulting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
we compete with a large number of diverse service providers  including business operations consulting firms  such as huron consulting group  financial consulting firms  such as fti consulting  inc  management consulting firms  such as mckinsey company  booz company and booz allen hamilton  accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
in addition  since there are relatively low barriers to entry into the consulting services market  we expect new entrants into the operations management consulting field to result in continued and additional future competition 
we seek to compete by differentiating ourselves on the basis of our results driven culture  the experience of our consultants and a hands on approach to problem solving 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs  industry expertise  and name recognition than we have 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and solutions  either of which could harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors 

table of contents our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies are trade secrets not capable of being patented  and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or that our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to competition from others using methodologies that are substantially similar to our own 
employees at december   we had a total of employees  consisting of full time consultants  sales and marketing employees  administrative employees and consultants on furlough 
when on furlough  consultants continue to receive company benefits  but are not paid any salary unless they are called back to work 
they can be called back based on their individual qualifications to work on either short term sales efforts and marketing projects or client engagements 
we are highly selective in our hiring of consultants 
we recruit primarily experienced professionals with operational expertise 
we believe these highly sought after professionals choose to work for us because of the credentials  experience and reputation of our consultants  the opportunity to work on a diverse range of matters and our strong reputation 
we also develop and support our consultants in their career progression through training and development programs designed to match the skill sets of our consultants with the needs of our clients 
our compensation plan includes competitive base salary  incentives and benefits 
the compensation and corporate governance committee of our board of directors  at its discretion  determines the incentives and equity based compensation to be granted to our officers and employees 
our chief executive officer and senior management recommend performance compensation for our consultants  for our sales professionals and any other incentives granted to employees for approval by the compensation and corporate governance committee 
we have entered into nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will deter any of our employees from disclosing confidential information to third parties or from using such information to compete with us in the future 
our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
intellectual property we are dedicated to providing industry leading operations and process improvement solutions to our clients and fostering a culture of continuous learning for our consultants 
our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies have been developed at great expense  have required considerable effort on the part of skilled professionals and are considered trade secrets 
therefore  only in certain circumstances will we grant clients a limited license to make internal use of certain of our proprietary methodologies 
we maintain our trade secrets in strict confidence and include nondisclosure provisions as part of our standard engagement 
despite our efforts to protect proprietary trade secrets from unauthorized use or disclosure  such as use of nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees  our current or former employees or others may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our trade secrets 
since our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies and solutions are trade secrets not capable of being patented  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or that our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
we have secured federal registration for the service marks total cycle time and tct 
these registrations expire from august to may we also have secured federal service mark 
table of contents registration for several other marks important to our business 
we also have made filings in several european countries in an effort to secure protection of our marks in those countries 
we consider each of these service marks to be significant to our business 
the implementation of a successful process improvement program requires the proper selection  application  and management of process improvement tools 
in addition to our proprietary tools  we often use the following non proprietary tools when providing services to our clients hoshin kanri a step by step planning  implementation  and review process for the management of change in critical business processes kaizen an approach described by this japanese term which means small  incremental  continuous improvement  and the english translation of which is continuous or continual improvement lean an approach designed to result in a lean organization that delivers the exact product in the exact quantity with the exact quality that its customers need exactly when they need it metrics an approach that defines and employs a critical set of metrics that guide  measure  and prioritize activity to optimize impact on strategic objectives six sigma a set of tools that addresses problems of process variability and capability these tools are not unique to thomas group  however  the methodology used to select  deploy and measure the tools is as important to a program s success as are the tools themselves 
through our proprietary process value management methodology  our consultants seek to utilize the appropriate process improvement tools to predict the financial benefits that will be obtained through deployment of those tools in our client s organization

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves a very high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors when evaluating an investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we are currently unprofitable  and if we fail to generate new client relationships that result in significant sources of revenue  our business will suffer materially 
during march and april of  two of our multi year contracts with the us navy expired 
these contracts accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in our revenue for decreased significantly as compared to and  due in large part to these contract expirations 
in response to the loss of these contracts  we have implemented cost containment initiatives  reorganized our management structures  enhanced our product and service offerings and implemented enhanced business development processes 
to date  however  we have not been able to replace a significant portion of the revenue lost due to these contract expirations 
as a result of the loss of these contracts  our inability to develop new client relationships in sufficient volume  and our inability to reduce cost of sales and selling  general and administrative costs sufficiently to offset the decline in revenue  we were unprofitable in although we continue to reduce or contain costs  if we are unable to develop significant new client relationships and generate increased revenue from new consulting engagements to allow us to return to profitability in  our ability ultimately to recover will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing revenues and reducing or containing costs sufficiently to return to profitability 
our current cash resources might not be sufficient to meet our cash needs over time 
we continue to believe that our cash balances and expected tax refunds  together with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to provide funds that are adequate for our operating needs through march  however  if we are unable to generate positive cash flows sufficient to fund our needs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
during and  we experienced net losses 
we have developed a revised business plan for including an internal forecast of cash needs 
we believe that existing cash resources and cash generated from current operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash needs at least through march  if we are unable to achieve the revenue in our forecast  or if our costs are higher than we forecasted  then we may not have sufficient liquidity to allow us to recover in the future 
if we cannot consistently generate the required cash flows from operating activities  we will need to meet the additional operating shortfalls with existing cash on hand  or implement or seek alternative strategies 
there can be no assurance that existing cash will be sufficient  that we will have timely access to the capital or credit markets if needed  or that any of our other strategies can be implemented on satisfactory terms  on a timely basis  or at all to allow us sufficient time to return to profitability 

table of contents if we are unable to return to profitability during  we may receive a going concern opinion from our independent auditors at the end of this could materially and adversely affect our potential to sign contracts with new clients  further limiting our opportunity to return to profitability 
management believes that  as of december   we met the requirements of us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  for a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
management has prepared the financial statements included in this form k on that basis 
accordingly  the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects that may result from the outcome of various uncertainties described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
if we are unable to develop sufficient new business from existing and new clients to allow us to return to profitability  we may no longer meet this requirement as of the end of in that event  the report of our independent registered accounting firm with respect to our financial statements for the year ended december  may contain an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
such a statement may make it more difficult for us to sign new contracts with clients and to obtain necessary capital or credit  and may have other effects that further adversely impact our ability to return to profitability 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
beginning in the third quarter of  the us economy has experienced a significant downturn 
our results of operations generally are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve 
budgets for consulting services typically decrease during times of adverse economic conditions 
a decline in the level of business activity of our clients has negatively affected our ability to secure new client engagements  increased the likelihood of existing client engagement contract cancellations  and reduced our utilization rates  all of which has had a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue and on our operating results 
in addition  the current economic downturn has caused some clients to reduce or defer their expenditures for consulting services  making our recovery more difficult 
we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives to closely manage our expenses  however  current and future savings initiatives will not permit us to return to profitability without significant revenues from new contracts or new clients 
the current credit market conditions are unstable and unpredictable and they are impacting the economy in uncertain ways 
this situation may negatively impact our ability to generate the additional revenues required for us to return to profitability 
beginning in the fall of  credit markets in the us and worldwide became unstable and unpredictable and credit became difficult to obtain for many companies and organizations 
in response many companies and organizations reduced discretionary spending  including spending on consulting services 
although we believe our consulting services are a cost effective way for companies to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency  in periods of economic uncertainty prospective clients may not be willing to commit to projects that are typically three to months or longer in duration 
unless the current credit markets stabilize in the near future  the current instability and uncertainty may make it more difficult for us to sign new consulting contracts with new or former clients and may negatively impact our ability to return to profitability 

table of contents we are currently not in compliance with nasdaq rules for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market and are at risk of being delisted  which may decrease the liquidity of our common stock and subject us to the sec s penny stock rules 
on september   we received two nasdaq staff deficiency letters indicating that we no longer complied with i the minimum bid price requirements as set forth in listing rule a of the nasdaq stock market  which requires that listed securities maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share  and ii the minimum market value of publicly held shares as set forth in listing rule b c  which requires that the market value of publicly held shares be at least  after considering the alternatives  on december   we voluntarily submitted to the nasdaq stock market an application to transfer the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
our request was approved effective december  on march   we received notification from the nasdaq stock market that we had not regained compliance with the nasdaq listing rules requiring that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share 
failure to regain compliance may result in the delisting of the company s common stock from the nasdaq capital market 
on march   we filed a request for a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to appeal the nasdaq stock market s determination 
this action will automatically stay the delisting of our common stock until the listing qualification panel issues its decision 
under the nasdaq listing rules  the panel may  in its discretion  determine to continue our listing pursuant to an exception to the nasdaq listing rules for a maximum of calendar days from the date of the staff s notification  or through september   to allow us additional time to comply with the listing rules 
however  there can be no assurances that the panel will do so or that we ultimately will be able to comply with the listing rules 
the date for the hearing is april  if we are delisted from the nasdaq capital market  our common stock may be traded over the counter on the otc bulletin board or on the pink sheets 
these alternative markets  however  are generally considered to be less efficient than the nasdaq capital market 
many over the counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the nasdaq markets  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market  there may be a limited market for our stock  trading in our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further 
in addition  the trading of our common stock on over the counter markets will materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us or at all 
securities that trade over the counter are no longer eligible for margin loans  and a company trading over the counter cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or blue sky laws  which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances  including those pursuant to employee option plans  stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities 
if our securities are delisted and transferred to either the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets  there may also be other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees 
in addition  our common stock may become subject to penny stock rules 
the sec generally defines penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
we are not currently subject to the penny stock rules because our common stock qualifies for an exception to the sec s penny stock rules for companies that have an equity security that is quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
however  if we were delisted  our common stock would become subject to the penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common stock 
if our common stock were considered penny stock  the ability of broker dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the secondary market would be limited and  as a result  the market liquidity for our common 
table of contents stock would be adversely affected 
we cannot assure that trading in our securities will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future 
we are a small company with a thinly traded stock  and two of our stockholders control more than of our stock 
between early and mid january  we repurchased stock in the open market  which has further reduced the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis 
as a result  a stockholder s liquidity may be seriously limited 
we recently completed a rule b plan under which we repurchased shares of our common stock in market transactions between april and mid january these repurchases may have provided additional liquidity for our stockholders during that time period 
currently  we have no plans to resume stock repurchases under this plan or otherwise  so company repurchases will no longer be a potential source of additional liquidity for our stockholders 
our largest two stockholders who are also members of our board of directors collectively own over of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the average daily trading volume for shares of our common stock is limited  often less than  shares per day 
as a result  a stockholder may not be able to quickly or efficiently liquidate his her position in our common stock 
combined  these factors may result in limited stockholder liquidity 
our engagements may be terminated by our clients on short notice 
the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients without cause  with short notice typically days and without penalty 
when contracts are terminated unexpectedly  the costs associated with the lost revenue may not be reduced in a timely manner 
following an unexpected termination  we may not be able to rapidly deploy our consultants to other projects  which would result in under utilization of resources 
in addition  because much of our work is project based rather than recurring in nature  we may not be able to replace cancelled contracts and maintain our utilization rates with new business 
consequently  our revenue and results of operations in subsequent periods may suffer 
we derive a portion of our revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process 
if we are unable to win new awards consistently over any extended period  our business could be adversely affected 
a portion of our contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process 
the competitive bidding process increases competition and pricing pressure  and we may be required to decrease our profit margins on our professional services and solutions in order to win a contract over our competitors 
if we are unable to win new contract awards consistently over any extended period or if the proportion of our contracts obtained through a competitive bidding process increases further  our business will be adversely affected and cause our results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the client requires further services and solutions of the type provided by the contract  there may be a competitive re bidding process 
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
we derive our revenue from a limited number of engagements and our revenue could be adversely affected by the loss of a significant client or the cancellation of a significant engagement 
historically we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of engagements 
from year to year  revenue from one or more individual clients may exceed of our revenue for such period 
for the year ended december   four clients each represented more than of our revenue 
if contracts with major clients are not renewed upon termination or if any of our significant engagements is reduced in scope or cancelled  we would lose a significant amount of 
table of contents revenue 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year due to the specific engagement nature of our business 
a client accounting for a significant portion of our revenue in one year may not comprise a significant portion of our revenue in the following year due to completion of the project  early termination of the project or a reduction of the scope of our engagement in the following year 
thus  in order to maintain revenue or grow revenue  we generally have to sell new engagements to new clients 
during we had difficulty doing so  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so more productively in a portion of our revenue is derived from government client engagements and this exposes us to various risks inherent in government contracts and the government contracting process 
we perform work for various government entities and agencies 
as a result  our business is susceptible to special risks inherent in government contracts and the government contracting process  including the following government entities fund projects annually through congressionally appropriated monies pursuant to the government budgeting cycle beginning on october of each year 
while in some cases our government engagements may be planned and executed as multi year projects  the initial contract term is typically one year or less  running through the next september after the contract is signed  and may contain options to annually extend the term through the end of the project 
extensions are generally awarded each october through the end of the project in conjunction with the government budgeting cycle 
our government clients reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects with limited notice for lack of approved funding and at their convenience 
occasionally  congressional approval for appropriations extends beyond october in such a case  we typically obtain short term extensions to fund the project until congressional approval is obtained 
if the government budget is not approved by the beginning of a government budgeting cycle  work on existing projects may be halted or new engagements may be delayed until the budget is approved and signed 
in such cases  funding for these engagements may be further delayed due to a backlog of contracts to be issued by the various government contracting offices  resulting in further delays in revenue for us 
our government clients reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts 
such an audit may result in prospective adjustments to previously agreed rates for our work and affect our future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with related or other government entities 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than commercial contracts 
the number and terms of new government contracts signed can be affected significantly by political and economic factors  such as pending elections  changes in administrations  and revisions to government policies 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of its accuracy  may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
we may have difficulty finding suitable professionals to enable us to comply with such regulations due to the unique experience qualifications for our consultants for some engagements 

table of contents many of our government clients are affected by the timing and duration of military conflicts in which the united states is involved 
funds intended for future contract renewals could be re appropriated and may not be available for our services and solutions as a result of the fiscal needs of other areas of the military during times of conflict 
government personnel who make decisions with respect to the award of military and other government contracts move in and out of such decision making positions 
we must expend significant effort educating such decision makers about our business and capabilities  and developing and maintaining relationships with decision makers at appropriate levels within our client organizations 
if we fail to successfully identify  educate and maintain relationships with appropriate decision makers within our clients organizations  our ability to compete for new contracts  and therefore our business generally  may suffer 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entity involved  but also other related and unrelated government entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
failure to maintain strong relationships with our contracting intermediaries could result in less favorable contract terms and a decline in our revenue 
in prior years we have derived substantial revenue from government engagements in which we utilized a contracting intermediary 
although we also contract directly with the federal government through our listing with the general services administration  we evaluate  on a project by project basis  whether to use an intermediary to act as a prime contractor and provide contracting and administrative services 
we expect to continue to use intermediaries as prime contractors for certain contracts with the federal government or with other governmental or public entities when appropriate 
in such cases  we will enter into agreements with such intermediaries that define the terms of our arrangement such as payment terms and specific deliverables 
future terms with contracting intermediaries may be less favorable than the terms under which we currently operate 
financial difficulties of an intermediary could cause a delay in remission of government funds to us and force us to seek other intermediaries 
we enter into fixed  task based and incentive fee engagements with our clients and unexpected costs  delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions or performance improvements could make our contracts less profitable 
we charge for our professional services and solutions based on fixed fee arrangements  task based fees or incentive fees 
fixed fee contracts require us to price our contracts by estimating our expenditures in advance 
our ability to properly estimate the costs and timing for completing client projects is critical to the profitability of our fixed fee contracts 
task based contracts also require us to estimate our expenditures in advance  and an appropriate billing amount is assigned to each completed task or deliverable based on the estimated cost for each specific task 
incentive fees are based on client specific measures  such as the achievement of specified process improvements  cost reductions or designated goals 
we must estimate our costs to deliver such client specific measures and design the incentive calculation accordingly to achieve our desired profit margin 
our cost  pricing and margin estimates reflect our professional judgment regarding our costs and the efficiencies of our consultants and processes 
any increased or unexpected costs  delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions or performance improvements in connection with the performance of these engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  incentive fees are affected by the client s business performance and prevailing economic conditions  both of 
table of contents which are beyond our control  which may cause variability in revenue and profit margins earned on such contracts and may limit our ability to forecast our future revenue 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and fluctuations in operating results could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in future quarters  operating results may be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock may decline 
factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include the beginning and ending of significant contracts during a quarter  the number  size and scope of our ongoing engagements  variations in the amount of revenue attributable to incentive fees  our ability to recruit and retain qualified professionals  the extent to which our consultants can be reassigned efficiently from one engagement to another  fluctuations in demand for our professional services and solutions resulting from budget cuts  project delays  cyclical downturns or similar events  the occurrence and duration of conflicts involving the united states military  which could cause delays or changes in program operations related to our government clients  clients decisions to divert resources to other projects  collectability of receivables  and reductions in the prices of services and solutions offered by our competitors 
our gross margins and profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
our gross margin is largely a function of the fees we are able to charge for our services and solutions and the efficiency with which we are able to utilize our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to generate sufficient revenue or to maintain the pricing for our services and solutions or to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our consultants without corresponding cost reductions  our gross margins and profitability will be negatively impacted 
our ability to generate revenue and our pricing for our professional services and solutions is affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services and solutions  introduction of new services or solutions by us or our competitors  competition for a specific contract  pricing policies of our competitors  and market demand for our services and solutions and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of our client engagements  unanticipated changes in the duration or scope of client engagements  
table of contents our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and solutions and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each area of expertise  and our ability to manage attrition 
the consulting services industry is highly competitive and actions by competitors could render our services and solutions less competitive  causing revenue and profit margin to decline 
the consulting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
we compete with a large number of diverse service providers  including business operations consulting firms  financial consulting firms  management consulting firms  accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
in addition  since there are relatively low barriers to entry into the consulting services market  we expect new entrants into our operations management consulting field to result in continued and additional future competition 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs  industry specific expertise and name recognition than we do 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and solutions  either of which could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to compete depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the prices at which others offer competitive services  including aggressive price competition and discounting on individual engagements  the ability of our competitors to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  the extent  if any  to which our competitors develop proprietary tools that improve their ability to compete  the ability of our clients and potential clients to perform the services themselves  and the extent of our competitors responsiveness to client needs 
we may not be able to compete effectively on these or other factors 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our market position  and therefore our revenue and results of operations  could decline 
if we are unable to attract  hire  develop  train and retain experienced consultants and sales professionals  our competitive position and financial performance could suffer 
our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services and solutions and our success depends upon the efforts  abilities and project execution of our business consultants 
our consultants have highly specialized skills 
if key consultants leave and we are unable to replace them with suitable candidates  we could experience difficulty in managing the affected client engagements 
professionals with requisite credentials and experience qualified to be our consultants are in great demand and we face significant competition for these professionals from our competitors  academic institutions  government entities  research firms and other organizations  including our clients 
in addition  we rely on our sales professionals to develop business opportunities and client relationships 
we face significant competition for these sales professionals from our competitors 
competing employers for both consultants and sales professionals may be able to offer greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
typically  our consultants have close relationships with the clients they serve 
our agreements with our clients typically include non solicitation arrangements 
if a client hires one of our consultants in violation of the non solicitation provisions  we will consider any legal remedies we may have on a 
table of contents case by case basis 
however  we may decide preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with our clients  or other concerns  outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recovery 
therefore  we may determine not to pursue legal action 
furthermore  our employment agreements with our employees  including consultants and sales professionals  typically include non competition provisions 
however  many states  including texas  generally interpret non competition clauses narrowly 
therefore  if a consultant or salesperson leaves and goes into business in competition with us or joins a competitor  we may not have reasonably available legal recourse and our client relationships could suffer 
our inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain consultants or sales professionals could limit our ability to accept or complete engagements and adversely affect our competitive position and financial performance 
it may be difficult for us to differentiate the professional services and solutions we offer to our clients from those offered by our competitors 
many of our competitors offer consulting services that are similar to those provided by our consultants 
although we strive to differentiate our services and solutions by using experienced professionals to deliver improvements using our proprietary pvm approach and methodology  there can be no guarantee that potential clients will find such differentiation persuasive 
if we cannot effectively differentiate our services and solutions from those offered by our competitors  our sales efforts could be adversely affected  and therefore our revenue and our results of operations could decline 
we must continually enhance our services and solutions to meet the changing needs of our clients or face the possibility of losing future business to competitors 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing services and solutions and to introduce new services and solutions to meet the requirements of our clients in a rapidly developing and evolving market 
for example  certain clients may require a different methodology from what our consultants typically utilize 
in such cases  we may have to train our consultants to utilize different methodologies 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  professional staffs and expertise in certain methodologies than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in client requirements 
if we are unable to anticipate or respond adequately to our clients needs  our revenue could decline and our results of operations could suffer 
maintaining our reputation is critical to our future success 
we have invested significant time and resources in building our reputation and name recognition 
our ability to gain market acceptance of the thomas group brand and to secure new engagements depends heavily on our reputation and our ability to provide high quality  reliable and cost effective services and solutions 
some of our engagements come from former or existing clients or from referrals by former or existing clients 
consequently  if we fail to perform our services and solutions in a manner meeting our clients expectations  our reputation may be damaged and our ability to attract new business or new consultants  our competitive position and our results of operations could suffer 
if we are unable to grow  or if we fail to manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business successfully  our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected 
any failure on our part to grow or to manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business successfully could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect over time to grow our operations by expanding into other areas of the government and by strengthening our position in certain commercial sectors 
expanding our position in these areas will likely require extensive management attention and may increase our overall selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also may expand by hiring additional consultants  either individually or as members of existing groups  
table of contents or acquiring complementary businesses 
alternatively  from time to time  we may need to take labor force resizing actions to account for fluctuations in the level of our business 
these activities could result in the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company 
we also could encounter difficulties in integrating persons from other firms with diverse professional backgrounds  experiences and organizational cultures into our own organization 
expansion creates new and increased management and training responsibilities for our employees 
expansion also increases demands on our internal systems  procedures and controls and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
if we do not manage growth or fluctuations in the size of our business effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and damage our reputation 
our engagements typically address complex business challenges which require us to exercise professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
if a client questions the quality of our work  the client could bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities and  regardless of the merits or outcome  could be very costly and could distract our management and damage our reputation 
although our engagement agreements typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims  they may not protect us under some circumstances 
in addition  we carry professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims  but policy limits and breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of our legal defense 
for example  we provide services and solutions on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
liability in excess of our insurance limits would have to be borne directly by us and could seriously harm our profitability  financial position and reputation 
inability to protect intellectual property could harm our competitive position and financial performance 
we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which are important to our success 
our pvm approach and proprietary methodologies are trade secrets not capable of being patented  and there can be no assurance our competitors will not acquire or develop substantially similar methodologies or that our clients will not adopt our methodologies without our assistance 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary trade secrets from unauthorized use or disclosure  such as use of nondisclosure and non competition agreements with our current and former employees  our current or former employees or others may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our trade secrets 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary trade secrets may not prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect intellectual property rights as fully as in the united states 
the unauthorized use of our trade secrets or use of substantially similar methodologies and solutions by our competitors or others could harm our competitive position and financial performance 

table of contents if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  if we are unable to timely complete our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm concludes that we have a material weakness in internal control not identified by management when required to opine on our assessment of internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ending december   we may be subject to regulatory sanctions  a loss of public confidence  and other negative consequences 
also  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules require us to perform an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to publicly disclose the assessment in our annual report on form k 
these rules will also require that we obtain an attestation of management s assessment from our independent registered public accounting firm beginning with the year ended december  we dedicated significant management  financial and other resources in connection with our compliance with these rules in these efforts include a review of our existing internal control structure 
effective internal controls assist us in providing reliable financial reports and to effectively detect and prevent fraud 
however  we are now a much smaller company 
as we have reduced our general and administrative staff  it has become more difficult to achieve and maintain the existing internal control structure  and to afford the costs of doing so 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls for the year ending december   we may not be able to conclude  on an ongoing basis  that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act of if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls  or to obtain an attestation from our independent registered accounting firm at december  as presently required  we may experience a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
this could harm our ability to sign new contracts with clients and our ability to obtain financing for the business  and may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
operating internationally exposes us to special risks and factors that could negatively impact our business or operations and could result in increased expenses and declining profit margin 
we currently operate primarily in the united states and have smaller operations in europe and south america 
if our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense associated with establishing and maintaining our international operations  our results of operations could suffer 
international operations create special risks  including the following local legal and regulatory requirements  such as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs and foreign taxes  sanctions  data privacy laws and labor regulations  may impair our ability to operate efficiently or expatriate foreign profits  enforcing agreements with clients and collecting accounts receivable may be more difficult in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign intellectual property laws may make enforcement of our intellectual property rights in foreign countries more difficult  increased competition from local consultants may hamper our marketing and sales opportunities in certain locations  general economic and political conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our earnings from operations in those countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  may affect demand for our services and solutions and may adversely affect the profitability in united states dollars of services and solutions provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our services is made in the local currency  and 
table of contents more burdensome employee benefit requirements may impair our ability to maintain appropriate gross profit margins 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
we ceased paying dividends after the payment for the quarter ended december   which was paid in january the payment of future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictive covenants in our credit facility if any  future business prospects and any other matters that our board of directors deems relevant 
we currently have no plans to pay dividends in the future 
we may need additional capital in the future  and this capital may not be available to us 
the raising of additional capital may dilute existing stockholders ownership 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund operating losses  expand our operations  develop new services and solutions  respond to competitive pressures  or pursue strategic acquisitions 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute our existing stockholders ownership percentage 
based on our current forecast  we believe that existing cash resources and cash generated from current operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash needs at least through march  our inability to raise additional financing  if needed  could have adverse consequences to our existing stockholders and to us 
any future decreases in our operating income  cash flow  or stockholders equity may further impair our future ability to raise additional funds to finance operations 
any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  our directors and significant stockholders gen

overview we are a professional services firm that executes and implements process improvements and culture change management operations strategies to produce improved operational and financial performance for our clients globally 
we are a delaware corporation founded in and headquartered in irving  texas 
through our proprietary process value management  or pvm  methodology  our consultants refine processes throughout an organization to give our clients a competitive advantage that increases revenues  lowers costs  and generates cash 
with our more than years of change management experience  innovation  and knowledge leadership  we have demonstrated our ability to apply this methodology in a wide variety of organizations 
process value management is our proprietary methodology to identify  prioritize  and quantify the amount and timing of cross functional business improvement opportunities 
the pvm approach and methodology is designed to help an organization increase overall effectiveness by focusing on performance drivers throughout the organization like speed cycle time  quality first pass yield  and productivity 
the pvm approach and methodology is widely applicable to almost all types of enterprises  including government entities  military organizations  for profit companies  and not for profit enterprises  to help drive sustainable improvements in operations and reduced costs 
for marketing purposes  in we were organized into four practices 
these practices  which focus our marketing efforts into client industry sectors  are aerospace and defense contractors  government including all branches of the us military  healthcare  transportation and logistics in the future we may create additional practices as we see potential market opportunities in other areas  or we may combine or eliminate practices when necessary to meet market conditions 
our practice leaders and principals are responsible for sales and marketing to prospective clients 
we perform services and provide solutions for clients pursuant to contracts that generally have terms of 
table of contents two weeks to one year  although some contracts may be for a longer term 
we are compensated for our professional services and solutions in one or more of three ways fixed fees  task based fees  or incentive fees 
our fee type and structure for each client engagement depends on a number of variables  including the size of the client  the complexity and geographic dispersion of its business  the extent of the opportunity for us to improve the client s processes and other factors 
some of our contracts are cancellable with little notice 
we do not report backlog because we believe the uncertainties associated with cancelable contracts  particularly in our commercial business  may render such information misleading 
the majority of our revenue is derived from fixed fee and task based fee contracts 
fixed fee revenue is recognized on the proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
in order to calculate the completion ratio on a given project  time and effort to date are divided by the total estimated time and effort for the entire project 
this ratio is then multiplied by the total fixed fee to be earned on the project  resulting in the amount of revenue earned to date 
a few of our fixed fee contracts  primarily assessments  are recognized using the completed contract performance model as these contracts are generally one to six weeks in duration and conclude with a presentation or agreed upon deliverable to the clients management 
revenues attributable to fixed fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
task based fees are recognized as revenue when the relevant task  as defined in the contract  is completed  usually on a monthly basis 
revenues attributable to task based fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
incentive fees  in some cases  may be earned based on improvements in a variety of client performance measures typically involving cycle time  asset utilization and productivity 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related client improvements are achieved and we obtain the client s acceptance 
our incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis for the payment of incentive fees 
in order to mitigate the risk of disputes arising over the achievement of performance improvements  which drive incentive fees  we obtain customer agreement to these achievements prior to recognizing revenue 
typically these contracts are for commercial customers and they provide for a base fee and an additional incentive fee earned according to a formula in the contract 
incentive fees are affected by our clients business performance and prevailing economic conditions 
revenues attributable to incentive fees were  and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   we had no contractual agreements that provided for incentive fees in addition to fixed fees 
while incentive fees are not currently a significant portion of our revenue  earlier in our history they have been more significant 
as we attempt to diversify our business in the future to include more commercial work  incentive fees could again become a more significant portion of our revenue 
reimbursement revenue represents our clients repayment of our mutually agreed upon travel expenses as incurred 
all billable travel expenses are submitted to and approved by the client 
revenues attributable to reimbursement were  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for some clients  the fixed fee or task based fee is inclusive of travel 
in these cases  the travel expense is included in cost of sales 

table of contents cost of sales represents the direct costs involved in providing services and solutions to our clients 
the components include  but are not limited to  direct labor and benefit costs  support costs such as telecommunications and computer costs  travel costs and other costs incurred in providing services and solutions to our clients 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of all labor and other goods and services necessary for our selling and marketing efforts  human resource support  accounting and finance services  legal and other professional services  facilities and equipment  information technology and telecommunications support and services  and other corporate functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization on the fixed assets used to support these functions 
on february   our board of directors suspended the payment of future quarterly dividends 
payment of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictive covenants in our credit facility  future business prospects and any other matters that our board of directors deems relevant 
we paid dividends of per share on january   april   july  and october  on december   our board of directors declared a dividend of payable to shareholders of record as of december  this dividend was paid on january  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when realizable and earned generally as services and solutions are provided over the life of a contract 
fixed fee revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model which approximates the percentage completion method  based on direct labor hours expended and  when applicable  the completed performance model 
task based  or deliverable based  fees are recognized when the relevant task or deliverable is completed 
incentive fee revenue is recognized in the period in which the related improvements are achieved 
our incentive fee agreements with our clients define in advance the performance improvement standards that will form the basis of our incentive fees earned 
we do not recognize incentive fee revenue until the client has agreed that performance improvements have in fact been achieved 
unbilled receivables although fixed fee revenue recognition generally coincides with billings  as an accommodation to our clients  we may structure fee billings to increase in the latter stages of a program 
in such instances  amounts collectible for services and solutions provided  but not yet billed  are represented in unbilled receivables 

table of contents deferred revenue we occasionally receive advance payments of a portion of our fees 
advance payments are classified as deferred revenue upon receipt and recorded as revenue when earned 
deferred taxes income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method required by asc  income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences resulting from timing differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
these timing differences are associated with differences between the financial and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
under asc  a statutory change in tax rates will be recognized immediately in deferred taxes and income 
net deferred taxes are recorded both as a current deferred income tax asset and as other long term liabilities based upon the classification of the related timing difference 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered when determining the need for a valuation allowance 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in accordance with asc  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
in addition to timing differences arising from operating assets and liabilities  we also record deferred tax assets for the tax benefits of net operating losses and foreign tax credits 
for united states federal tax purposes  at december   we had net operating loss carryovers of approximately million 
under the limitations of section of the internal revenue code  discussed below  million was used to offset united states taxable income in in  million expired under section  but million in united states net operating loss was generated  resulting in a balance of million at december  in  we used million of the net operating loss to offset united states taxable income and used million of the net operating loss carryforward limited under section  resulting in a net operating loss carryforward balance of million at december  in each of fiscal years and  we used million of the net operating loss carryforward balance  resulting in a million balance at december   and a million balance at december  and december  as of december   we had a million net operating loss carryforward balance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during we determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate on only approximately  of the net operating loss carryforward  due to annual limitations under section therefore  we removed million of the valuation allowance 
as of december   we reduced the valuation allowance by  as a result of another revaluation of this account  resulting in a  balance at year end 
as of december   the valuation allowance is  our assessment included a review of the critical assumptions affecting the ultimate realizability of this deferred tax asset 
for we will be able to claim a refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years 
generally  in order for us to be able to utilize the tax deductions that give rise to the balance of this deferred tax asset  we will need to generate adequate profits in the future 
as a result  and particularly in light of our net losses in recent periods  it is management s view that the most critical assumption affecting the realizability of this deferred tax asset is the assumption that we will be able to return to sustained profitability 
in order to achieve such profitability  we will need to generate additional revenue from new clients and to continue the recent success of reducing costs and operating 
table of contents with a lower cost structure 
we believe that our year history of success in delivering high quality services to our clients  our recent efforts to diversify our product and service offerings to appeal to a broader range of potential customers  and our recent success at reducing and managing costs are all positive factors in assessing the likelihood of our future profitability 
although it is impossible to predict with certainty when or if we will return to profitability  management is committed to this outcome and believes that we will be able ultimately to achieve this goal 
therefore  we have concluded as of this point in time that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize this deferred tax asset 
if future analyses of the positive and negative evidence indicate that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized  a partial or full valuation allowance may be required  which could have a negative effect on net income in the period that it becomes more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we also follow the guidance under asc  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
under asc  tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
asc also requires additional disclosures about unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions and a reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized benefit 
in addition  asc requires interest to be recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions 
an income tax penalty is recognized as expense when the tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid the imposition of a penalty 
as of december   we did not have any liabilities or associated interest under asc we adopted the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  as a result of the implementation of asc  we recognized a  increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheets at january  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was subsequently reversed upon settlement with the irs during a routine audit 
we see no significant changes to the facts and circumstances underlying our reserves and allowances 
we recognize deductible interest accrued related to tax penalties as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and we recognize non deductible accrued interest and penalties as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
non deductible penalties and interest were   and  for the years  and  respectively 
we are currently subject to the statutes of limitations for federal and state income taxes in the states in which we perform our services 
the last year that is now closed for audit for federal income taxes is our federal income tax return for the year ended december  was audited by the internal revenue services in there were no changes to the taxes due as a result of this audit 
accumulated other comprehensive loss translation of the financial statements of our operations in europe and asia resulted in accumulated translation adjustments of approximately  at december  that was required to be carried on the balance sheet as a separate component of stockholders equity 
during  we liquidated our subsidiaries in switzerland resulting in a reclassification of a  accumulated other comprehensive loss to the income statement 
during  we liquidated our hong kong subsidiary 
table of contents resulting in a  accumulated other comprehensive gain to the income statement 
as of december   we had no accumulated other comprehensive gain on the balance sheet 
performance share awards our performance share awards are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of asc  stock compensation 
in accordance with asc  compensation expense is recognized over the applicable period of service for performance share awards that are deemed by management to be reasonably achievable 
government contracts for the last several years we have worked extensively on engagements with two divisions of the us navy  each governed by a separate contractual agreement 
one of these contracts expired march  and the other expired april  for the year ended december  these two contracts represented approximately of our revenue  and for the year ended december  they represented approximately of our revenue 
to date  we have not fully replaced the revenue that was previously generated through these expired government contracts 
we continue to work on smaller programs with the us navy as well as the us army 
we are actively working to expand our business with the entire us military as well as other departments within the us government
