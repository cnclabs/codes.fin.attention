while the current economic downturn has not meaningfully impacted the company s ability to collect receivables  the company continues to do business with certain foreign governments which have recently experienced credit rating downgrades and may become unable to pay for the company s products or services 
credit ratings the company s credit ratings at december  were as follows 
standard poor s fitch moody s ratings senior debt a a a short term debt a f p outlook positive stable stable there were no changes to the company s credit ratings in if baxter s credit ratings or outlooks were to be downgraded  the company s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted 
however  any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company s ability to draw on its credit facilities  and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company s outstanding debt  unless  with respect to certain debt instruments  preceded by a change in control of the company 
net investment hedges in  the company terminated its remaining net investment hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment hedges 
the company historically hedged the net assets of certain of its foreign operations using a combination of foreign currency denominated debt and cross currency swaps 
in  the company reevaluated its net investment hedge strategy and elected to reduce the use of these instruments as a risk management tool 
as part of the change in strategy the company executed offsetting  or mirror  cross currency swaps relating to over half of the existing portfolio that effectively fixed the net amount that the company would ultimately pay to settle the cross currency swap agreements subject to this strategy 
the net after tax losses related to net investment hedge instruments recorded in other comprehensive income were million and million in and  respectively 
when the cross currency swaps are settled  the cash flows are reported within the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
when the mirror swaps are settled  the cash flows are reported in the operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
of the million of net settlement payments in  million of cash outflows were included in the financing section and million of cash inflows were included in the operating section 
of the million of settlement payments in  million of cash outflows were included in the financing section and million of cash outflows were included in the operating section 
contractual obligations as of december   the company had contractual obligations excluding accounts payable  accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and contingent liabilities payable or maturing in the following periods 
less than one to three to more than in millions total one year three years five years five years short term debt long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities interest on short and long term debt and capital lease obligations operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits contractual obligations interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate and cross currency swap agreements 
certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events 
the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december  refer to notes and for further discussion regarding the company s debt instruments and related cross currency and interest rate agreements outstanding at december  the primary components of other long term liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet are liabilities relating to pension and other postemployment benefit plans  cross currency swaps  foreign currency hedges  litigation and certain income tax related liabilities 
the company projected the timing of the future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates where applicable and estimates of the timing of payments for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates 
the actual timing of payments could differ from the estimates 
the company contributed million  million and million to its defined benefit pension plans in  and  respectively 
most of the company s plans are funded 
the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns  changes in laws and regulations  and other variables 
therefore  the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows 
refer to the discussion below regarding the pension protection act of the pension plan balance included in other long term liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled billion at december  includes the company s significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations 
for cancelable agreements  includes any penalty due upon cancellation 
these commitments do not exceed the company s projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
examples include firm commitments for raw material purchases  utility agreements and service contracts 
due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions  the long term liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of million at december  has been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements baxter periodically enters into off balance sheet arrangements where economical and consistent with the company s business strategy 
certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business  and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with gaap such as contingent joint development and commercialization arrangement payments 
also  upon resolution of uncertainties  the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities for certain matters such as contractual indemnifications 
the following is a summary of significant off balance sheet arrangements and contingencies 
receivable securitizations where economical  the company has entered into agreements with various financial institutions in which the entire interest in and ownership of the receivable is sold  principally consisting of trade receivables originated in japan 
the company had also entered into agreements in which undivided interests in certain pools of receivables were sold  principally consisting of hardware lease receivables originated in the united states and trade receivables originated in europe 
refer to note for a description of these arrangements 
the japanese securitization arrangement includes limited recourse provisions  which are not material to the consolidated financial statements 
joint development and commercialization arrangements in the normal course of business  baxter enters into joint development and commercialization arrangements with third parties  sometimes with companies in which the company has invested 
the arrangements vary but generally provide that baxter will receive certain rights to manufacture  market or distribute a specified technology or product under development in exchange for up front payments and contingent payments relating to the achievement of specified pre clinical  clinical  regulatory approval or sales milestones 
at december   the unfunded milestone payments under these arrangements totaled million 
this total excludes any contingent royalties 
based on the company s projections  any contingent payments made in the future will be more than offset over time by the estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired for those payments 
the majority of the contingent payments relate to arrangements in the bioscience segment 
refer to note for further information 
indemnifications during the normal course of business  baxter makes indemnities  commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be required to make payments related to specific transactions 
indemnifications include i intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use  sale or license of products and services  ii indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises  iii indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct  and iv indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts 
in addition  under baxter s amended and restated certificate of incorporation  and consistent with delaware general corporation law  the company has agreed to indemnify its directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the occurrence of prescribed events 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the company could be obligated to make 
to help address some these risks  the company maintains various insurance coverages 
based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements  the company does not believe that any significant payments related to its indemnifications will result  and therefore the company has not recorded any associated liabilities 
legal contingencies refer to note for a discussion of the company s legal contingencies 
upon resolution of any of these uncertainties  the company may incur charges in excess of presently established liabilities 
while the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty  and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for that period  the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
while the company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters  litigation is inherently uncertain  excessive verdicts do occur  and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 
funding of pension and other postemployment benefit plans the company s funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements  plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans  tax deductibility  the cash flows generated by the company and other factors 
volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding requirements 
the company is not legally obligated to fund its principal plans in the united states and puerto rico in the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions 
the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of at least million in  which includes a million discretionary cash contribution made to its pension plan in the united states in january the company expects to have net cash outflows relating to its other postemployment benefit opeb plan of approximately million in the table below details the funded status percentage of the company s pension plans as of december   including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of the company s funding policy outlined above 
the table excludes the million discretionary cash contribution made to the pension plan in the united states in january refer to note for further information 
united states and puerto rico international as of december  in millions qualified plans nonqualified plan funded plans unfunded plans total fair value of plan assets  n a n a  projected benefit obligation funded status percentage n a n a the pension protection act of ppa was signed into law on august  it is likely that the ppa will accelerate minimum funding requirements in the future 
insurance coverage the company discontinued its practice of buying product liability insurance coverage effective may  the unavailability of insurance coverage with meaningful limits at a reasonable cost reflects current trends in product liability insurance for healthcare manufacturing companies generally 
the company continues to evaluate available coverage levels and costs as market conditions change 
the company s net income and cash flows may be adversely affected in the future as a result of losses sustained 
financial instrument market risk the company operates on a global basis  and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and shareholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
refer to note for further information regarding the company s financial instruments and hedging strategies 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities  forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro  japanese yen  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  brazilian real and colombian peso 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
in addition  the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange 
gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 
financial market and currency volatility may reduce the benefits of the company s natural hedges and limit the company s ability to cost effectively hedge these exposures 
the company uses options  forwards and cross currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities 
the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december  is months 
the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 
the company historically hedged certain of its net investments in international affiliates  using a combination of debt denominated in foreign currencies and cross currency swap agreements 
as further discussed in note  in  the company terminated all of its remaining net investment hedges 
currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and requires such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government 
on january   the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of relative to the us dollar 
the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential  such as food and medicine  was changed to  while the rate for payments for non essential goods was changed to the company expects that the majority of its products imported into venezuela will be classified as essential goods and qualify for the rate 
the rate was used for the translation of the company s venezuelan subsidiary at december   because this is the rate at which dividends are expected to be remitted if and when such dividends are approved by the venezuelan government 
as of january   venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result  the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in venezuela will be the us dollar 
the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary is not expected to have a material impact on the financial results of the company 
as of december   the company s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar 
in  net sales in venezuela represented less than of baxter s total net sales 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near term movements in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option  forward and cross currency swap contracts outstanding at december   while not predictive in nature  indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuated unfavorably by against all currencies  on a net of tax basis  the net liability balance of million with respect to those contracts  which principally related to a hedge of us dollar denominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary  would increase by million 
a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  on a net of tax basis  the net asset balance of million would decrease by million  resulting in a net liability position 
the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option  forward and cross currency swap contracts outstanding at december  by replacing the actual exchange rates at december  with exchange rates that are unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency 
all other factors are held constant 
these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 
interest rate and other risks the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that the company believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
the company also periodically uses forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately of the company s weighted average interest rate during affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives  would have an immaterial effect on the company s  and earnings and on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 
as discussed in note  the fair values of the company s long term litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information 
a movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 
with respect to the company s investments in affiliates  the company believes any reasonably possible near term losses in earnings  cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company s consolidated financial position 
changes in accounting standards business combinations on january   the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of significant respects 
the key changes include the expansion of transactions that qualify as business combinations  the capitalization of ipr d as an indefinite lived asset  the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value  the expensing of acquisition costs  the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the acquired company  the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date  the recognition of post acquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax expense or benefit  and the expansion of disclosure requirements 
this standard was applicable for acquisitions made by the company on or after january   including the april consolidation of sigma and the august acquisition of certain assets of edwards crrt 
refer to note for further information regarding sigma and edwards crrt 
noncontrolling interests on january   the company adopted a new accounting standard which changes the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests historically referred to as minority interests 
the standard requires that noncontrolling interests be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity  but separate from baxter shareholders equity  and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to baxter and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated statements of income 
any losses in excess of the noncontrolling interest s equity interest continue to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest 
purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions 
upon a loss of control the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  is measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
in partial acquisitions  when control is obtained  of the assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are recognized at fair value as if the entire target company had been acquired 
the new standard was applied prospectively as of january   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which have been applied retrospectively for prior periods presented 
prior to the adoption of the new standard  the noncontrolling interests share of net income was included in other expense  net in the consolidated statements of income and the noncontrolling interests equity was included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the accounting related provisions of the new accounting standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two updates to the accounting standards codification related to revenue recognition 
the first update eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have been delivered 
the update also no longer allows use of the residual method when allocating consideration to deliverables 
instead  arrangement consideration is to be allocated to deliverables using the relative selling price method  applying a selling price hierarchy 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price should be used if it exists 
otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price should be used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  the company s best estimate of selling price should be used 
the second update eliminates tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance when the tangible products contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality 
both updates require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with prospective application for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospective application permitted 
early adoption is permitted 
the same transition method and period of adoption must be used for both updates 
the company adopted these updates in  prospectively applying them to arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  the early adoption of these updates did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and did not result in a change in its previously reported quarterly consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant  difficult or complex judgments by the company  often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results that differ from the company s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements  there have been no significant changes in the company s application of its critical accounting policies during the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances the company s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned 
specifically  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the shipping terms for the majority of the company s revenue arrangements are fob destination 
the recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant post delivery obligations  such as training  installation or other services 
the company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers 
in these cases  total arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
then the allocated consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above 
selling prices are determined by applying a selling price hierarchy 
selling prices are determined using vsoe  if it exists 
otherwise  selling prices are determined using tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  the company uses its best estimate of selling prices 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  chargebacks to wholesalers  and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded  and are reflected as a reduction of sales 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and  if necessary  revised  with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 
the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the reserve  the company considers historical credit losses  the past due status of receivables  payment history and other customer specific information  and any other relevant factors or considerations 
because of the nature of the company s customer base and the company s credit and collection policies and procedures  write offs of accounts receivable have historically not been significant generally less than of gross receivables 
the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable  which is at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information 
estimates of future costs under the company s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future 
the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves  but believes presently established reserves are adequate 
pension and opeb plans the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees 
these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee s compensation expense 
the valuation of the funded status and net benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions are reviewed annually  and revised if appropriate 
the significant assumptions include the following interest rates used to discount pension and opeb plan liabilities  the long term rate of return on pension plan assets  rates of increases in employee compensation used in estimating liabilities  anticipated future healthcare costs used in estimating the opeb plan liability  and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover used in estimating liabilities 
selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date 
the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believes its assumptions are appropriate 
the company s key assumptions are listed in note the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees  because these plans are the most significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
discount rate assumption for the us and puerto rico plans  at the measurement date december   the company used a discount rate of and to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan  respectively 
this discount rate will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for the company used a broad population of approximately aa rated corporate bonds as of december  to determine the discount rate assumption 
all bonds were denominated in us dollars  with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over moody s aa rated  non callable or callable with make whole provisions bonds by eliminating the top th percentile and bottom th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities 
this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve  to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans 
the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 
for plans in canada  japan  the united kingdom and the eurozone  the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans 
for the company s other international plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost  the company performs a sensitivity analysis 
holding all other assumptions constant  for each basis point ie  one half of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate  global pre tax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
return on plan assets assumption in measuring net periodic cost for  the company used a long term expected rate of return of for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees 
this assumption will also be used to measure net pension cost for this assumption is not applicable to the company s opeb plan because it is not funded 
the company establishes the long term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns  both company specific and relating to the broad market based on the company s asset allocation  as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations 
the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company s actual and targeted asset allocation 
in calculating net pension cost  the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 
to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost  the company performs a sensitivity analysis 
holding all other assumptions constant  for each basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption  global pre tax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
other assumptions the company used the retirement plan mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico 
for all other pension plans  the company utilized country and region specific mortality tables to calculate the plans benefit obligations 
the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover  considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 
the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience  market trends  and anticipated future company actions 
refer to note for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 
legal contingencies the company is involved in product liability  patent  commercial  regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business 
refer to note for further information 
the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters 
the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved 
the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring 
at december  total legal liabilities were million and total insurance receivables were million 
the company s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results 
with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries  after completing the assessment and accounting for the company s legal contingencies  the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected 
in performing the assessment  the company reviews available information  including historical company specific and market collection experience for similar claims  current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim  the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies  and other relevant information 
while the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty  and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for that period  the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters  litigation is inherently uncertain  excessive verdicts do occur  and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 
inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market value 
market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs and market value for work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable value 
the company reviews inventories on hand at least quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory  as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value 
the regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand  anticipated release of new products into the market either by the company or its competitors  historical experience and product expiration 
uncertain timing of product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to inventory valuation 
additional inventory provisions may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believes its estimates are appropriate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the company believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap  based on the technical support for the positions  the company s past audit experience with similar situations  and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities on january   the company adopted the new accounting standard for financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and on january   the company adopted the new accounting standard for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
for assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets  the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held  without consideration of transaction costs 
the majority of the derivatives entered into by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments 
the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and black scholes models 
the key inputs  which are observable  depend on the type of derivative  and include contractual terms  counterparty credit risk  interest rate yield curves  foreign exchange rates and volatility 
refer to the financial instrument market risk section above for disclosures regarding sensitivity analyses performed by the company and note for further information regarding the company s financial instruments 
in addition  the company s pension plan assets and contingent payments associated with business combinations are valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
the valuation of pension assets  which are recorded net of the plan s liabilities  depends on the type of security the plan holds 
principally  the securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets or pricing matrices or models that incorporate observable market data inputs 
refer to the pension and opeb plans section above and note for further information on the company s pension plans 
contingent payments are valued using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects management s expectations about probability of payment 
refer to note for further information on the company s contingent payments relating to acquisitions 
valuation of intangible assets  including ipr d the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value 
valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis  incorporating the stage of completion 
the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  the assessment of the asset s life cycle  and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset  including consideration of technical  legal  regulatory  economic and other factors 
each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
acquired ipr d is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
beginning in  as discussed further above  the company adopted a new accounting standard for accounting for business combinations 
under the new accounting standard  acquired ipr d included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset and is no longer expensed at the time of the acquisition 
development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred 
upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product  the indefinite lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
if the r d project is abandoned  the indefinite lived asset is charged to expense 
ipr d acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately 
for such transactions  payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset  and are classified as intangible assets 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with r d projects  there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses  nor that the r d project will result in a successful commercial product 
impairment of assets goodwill is subject to impairment reviews annually  and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
refer to note for further information 
the company s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign currency exchange rates  the selection of an appropriate discount rate  asset groupings  and other assumptions and estimates 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company s business plans and a market participant s views of the company and similar companies 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets  and potentially result in different impacts to the company s results of operations 
actual results may differ from the company s estimates 
stock based compensation plans stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires judgment 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment 
the company s stock compensation costs principally relate to awards of stock options  and the significant assumptions include long term projections regarding stock price volatility  employee exercise  post vesting termination  and pre vesting forfeiture behaviors  interest rates and dividend yields 
the company uses the black scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of baxter s stock and the implied volatility from traded options on baxter s stock 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected life of the option 
the forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre vesting employee forfeiture patterns 
in finalizing its assumptions  the company also reviews comparable companies assumptions  as available in published surveys and in publicly available financial filings 
the pre vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed each period based on historical experience and current projections for the future 
the use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense 
the fair value of an option is particularly impacted by the expected volatility and expected life assumptions 
to understand the impact of changes in these assumptions on the fair value of an option  the company performs sensitivity analyses 
holding all other variables constant  if the expected volatility assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in was increased by basis points ie  one percent  the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately  from to 
holding all other variables constant including the expected volatility assumption  if the expected life assumption used in valuing the stock options granted in was increased by one year  the fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common stock would increase by approximately  from to 
the company began granting performance share units psus in psus are earned by comparing the company s growth in shareholder value relative to a performance peer group over a three year period 
based on the company s relative performance  the recipient of a psu may earn a total award ranging from to of the initial grant 
the fair value of a psu is estimated by the company at the grant date using a monte carlo model 
a monte carlo model uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award 
the three primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the risk free rate  volatility of returns and correlation of returns 
the determination of the risk free rate is similar to that described above relating to the valuation of stock options 
the expected volatility and correlation assumptions are based on historical information 
the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believes the company s assumptions are appropriate  based upon the requirements of accounting standards for stock compensation and the company s historical and expected future experience 
hedging activities as further discussed in note and in the financial instrument market risk section above  the company uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risks 
as baxter operates on a global basis  there is a risk to earnings associated with foreign exchange relating to the company s recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
compliance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities and the company s hedging policies require the company to make judgments regarding the probability of anticipated hedged transactions 
in making these estimates and assessments of probability  the company analyzes historical trends and expected future cash flows and plans 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company s business plans 
if the company were to make different assessments of probability or make the assessments during a different fiscal period  the company s results of operations for a given period would be different 
new accounting standards transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard relating to the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and clarifies existing gaap as it relates to determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
the standard limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset 
the standard also requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
it is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november   with early adoption prohibited 
the new standard will be applied prospectively  except for the disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the new standard  which is effective for the company as of january   is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued a new standard that changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies

the standard requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
the standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises with a variable interest in a vie 
it is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november   with early adoption prohibited 
the new standard  which is effective for the company as of january   is not expected to have material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
