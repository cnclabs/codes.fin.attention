inhibitex  mscramm  and aurexis are registered trademarks of inhibitex  inc overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent or treat serious infections 
our research and development efforts are currently focused on small molecule antiviral compounds  and in particular  orally available therapies to treat herpes zoster  also referred to as shingles  and chronic infections caused by hcv 
currently available antiviral therapies have a number of therapeutic limitations that include inadequate potency  significant adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules  inconvenient methods of administration  and diminishing efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistant viruses 
we believe that our antiviral drug candidates have the potential to address a number of these limitations as well as unmet clinical needs in their respective intended indications 
in addition to our antiviral programs  we have also licensed the rights to certain intellectual property from our mscramm protein platform to pfizer for the development of active vaccines to prevent staphylococcal infections 
we believe there are significant business advantages in focusing on the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases  and in particular viral infections  which include the following infectious disease research and development programs  and in particular those focusing on antivirals  generally have shorter development cycle times when compared to other therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders  
table of contents historical data suggest that anti infective development programs that enter clinical development generally have a higher clinical success rate  on average  as compared to various other development program areas such as oncology  cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders  the clinical and regulatory pathway for many anti infective indications are well established and understood  many antiviral targets have been validated in previous preclinical studies or clinical trials of other compounds  thus providing the ability to benchmark or otherwise compare the safety and efficacy of new compounds at relatively early stages of development  and the emergence of drug resistant strains creates a continuing need for new drugs to treat certain infectious diseases  thus creating new markets and growing business opportunities 
we have not received regulatory approval to sell or market any of our current or past product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive any commercial revenues from any of our existing or future product candidates 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in may background infectious diseases are caused by pathogens present in the environment  such as viruses and bacteria  which enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes and overwhelm its natural defenses 
some infections are systemic  meaning they can affect the entire body  while others are localized in one location  organ or system within the body 
the severity of infectious diseases varies depending on the nature of the infectious agent  as well as the degree to which the body s immune system or available therapies can prevent or fight the infection 
the market for anti infective drugs can be divided into three general categories antiviral  antibacterial and antifungal 
the widespread use of anti infective drugs has led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases 
however  for many infectious diseases  current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes  significant drug related adverse or toxic side effects  complex dosing schedules and inconvenient methods of administration  such as injection or infusion 
these factors often lead to patients discontinuing treatment or failing to fully comply with treatment dosing schedules 
as a result  physicians are often required to modify therapy regimens throughout the course of treatment to avoid treatment failures 
moreover  a patient s failure to comply fully with a treatment dosing schedule can both accelerate and exacerbate drug resistance 
the ability of both viruses and bacteria to adapt rapidly to existing or new treatments through genetic mutations allows new strains to develop that are highly resistant to currently available drugs 
in recent years  the increasing prevalence of drug resistant strains has created ongoing treatment challenges with respect to many infectious diseases  including hiv aids and staphylococcus aureus s 
aureus infections 
viruses viruses are microscopic infectious agents consisting of an outer layer of protein surrounding a core of genetic material comprised of dna or rna 
viruses generally must invade living host cells in order to replicate and spread 
in many cases  the body s immune system can effectively combat an infection caused by a virus 
however  with certain viral infections  the body s immune system is unable to fully destroy the responsible virus  which results in persistent viral replication and the subsequent infection of healthy cells by the virus 
this ultimately leads to the deterioration or destruction of the infected cells  resulting in disease 
infections caused by viruses can be acute or chronic 
acute infection associated with viruses such as influenza or varicella zoster virus vzv  generally lasts for a relatively short period of time  and in most cases will ultimately self resolve in most immunocompetent individuals 
chronic infections  such as those caused by hcv  don t typically self resolve and can cause disease for months or years if left untreated 
viruses can also be characterized as either latent or active 
a latent virus  such as vzv  can remain in the body for long periods of time after the initial infection and generally will only cause disease when the body s immune system 
table of contents weakens  fails or is suppressed 
an active virus can cause a persistent infection or disease over an extended period of time  such as infections caused by hcv 
vaccines have been used for many years to prevent active viral infections from occurring 
antiviral drugs designed to treat or suppress rather than prevent viral diseases are generally small molecule  chemical compounds 
antiviral drugs are increasingly being developed to inhibit the replication of specific viruses  while some are active against a family of viruses 
viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs are increasingly a major challenge in the treatment of viral infections 
the ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication allows drug resistant strains to emerge when patients are using drugs that do not quickly and completely inhibit viral replication 
resistance occurs because viruses will continually make millions of copies of themselves every day  some of which will contain mutations in their genetic material 
mutations that confer a replication advantage in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to viral strains that are resistant or partially resistant to that drug 
these mutated viruses  while initially low in number  will eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient 
once this occurs  the treatment benefit of that antiviral drug often diminishes  resulting in treatment failure and the need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs  or classes of drugs 
in general  viruses that cause chronic infections  such as hcv  are more likely to develop drug resistance due to the long term and persistent exposure of the virus to the antiviral therapy 
bacteria unlike viruses  bacteria do not generally need to invade a living host cell in order to grow and replicate 
bacteria are unicellular  self propagating microorganisms that multiply through growth in bacterial cell size and the subsequent division of the cell 
bacteria can be broadly classified into two categories based upon the composition of their cell walls gram positive or gram negative 
many antibacterial drugs that are effective against gram positive bacteria are less effective or totally ineffective against gram negative bacteria  and vice versa 
antibacterial drugs that are active against a large number of both classes of bacteria are often referred to as broad spectrum antibacterials 
antibiotics  which are small molecule compounds  comprise the vast majority of currently marketed antibacterial drugs 
antibiotics have proved to be highly successful in controlling the morbidity and mortality that accompany many bacterial infections 
however  due to the widespread use and overuse of antibiotics over time  and the ability of bacteria to quickly develop drug resistance  many antibiotics now have diminished or limited efficacy 
the inability to effectively treat serious infections caused by drug resistant bacteria with antibiotics has led to increased mortality rates  prolonged hospitalizations and increased health care costs  and has become a public health issue of significant concern 
accordingly  in recent years  a number of novel approaches to prevent and treat bacterial infections  including new classes of antibiotics  vaccines and the use of antibodies  have emerged in development 
vaccines vaccines represent a approach in broadening the available clinical tools against the global health problem of hospital acquired  or nosocomial bacterial infections 
s 
aureus is the most frequent pathogen to cause nosocomial infections and affects a wide range of different patient groups 
infections are associated with a longer hospital stay  worse clinical outcome and high treatment costs 
mainly due to antibiotic overuse  many resistant strains of s 
aureus have emerged 
the most concerning of those is methicillin resistant s 
aureus mrsa  the incidence of which has increased rapidly in both the hospital and more recently  the community setting 
the high incidence of s 
aureus infections and the increasing occurrence of drug resistant strains are the key drivers for vaccine development 
the increasing incidence and the decreasing efficacy of available antibiotics against s 
aureus suggest that a vaccine to prevent such infections would be highly useful 
particularly in the hospital setting  vaccination of patients could potentially prevent a large number of s 
aureus infections  but the emergence of certain mrsa strains such as usa in the community setting indicates that vaccination would also be particularly useful for high risk community groups including athletes or prison inmates 
due to the increasing selective pressure on s 
aureus  new resistance mutations can be 
table of contents expected to emerge against available drugs 
to be able to control s 
aureus infections  it will therefore be crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches  and an effective vaccine could prove highly useful in both hospital and community settings to limit further spread of the pathogen and to reduce costs to healthcare systems 
our pipeline the following table summarizes key information regarding our anti infective product candidates drug stage of marketing candidate indication development status rights antivirals fv treatment of herpes zoster shingles clinical phase ii trial in progress inhibitex inx hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitor treatment of chronic hepatitis c infection preclinical expect ind filing and initiation of a phase i trial in first half of inhibitex antibacterials staphylococcal vaccines active vaccine to prevent s

aureus bloodstream infections clinical completed phase iia  seeking to out license inhibitex fv for shingles fv is an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug of cf that we are developing for the treatment of herpes zoster  or shingles  which is an infection caused by the reactivation of vzv 
published preclinical studies demonstrate that fv is significantly more potent against vzv than acyclovir  valacyclovir  and famciclovir  the fda approved drugs used for the treatment of shingles 
preclinical studies further demonstrate that fv has a much more rapid onset of antiviral activity  and can fully inhibit the replication of vzv more rapidly than these drugs at significantly lower concentration levels 
we believe these characteristics provide the potential for fv to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including acute pain  phn and lesions 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data from our phase i clinical trial suggests that fv has the potential to be dosed orally once a day at significantly lower levels than valacyclovir  acyclovir  and famciclovir 
we initiated a phase ii clinical trial for fv in the phase ii trial is a well controlled  double blind study comparing two arms of fv to an active control valacyclovir 
the trial protocol calls for the enrollment and randomization of approximately patients  aged years and older to one of three treatment arms mg fv administered once daily  mg fv administered once daily  and  mg valacyclovir administered three times per day 
in addition to further evaluating its safety  the main objectives of the trial are to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of fv in reducing the severity and duration of shingles related pain  the incidence of phn  and the time to lesion healing 
we anticipate having top line data available from this trial in the fourth quarter of market opportunity for the treatment of shingles vzv  a dna virus and a member of the herpes virus group  is the virus that causes both chickenpox and herpes zoster  or shingles 
chickenpox  the initial infection caused by vzv in an individual  generally occurs during childhood 
after the chickenpox infection subsides  vzv remains latent in the individual s dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia  but can re emerge later in life 
therefore  individuals who have had chickenpox are at risk for shingles 

table of contents although shingles can occur in any individual with a prior vzv infection  its incidence varies with its key risk factors  which are advanced age and immune status 
a study in suggested that based on age and sex adjusted estimates of the incidence of shingles extrapolated to the general population of the united states us that there are nearly million cases annually 
shingles incidence rates in the european union and japan  when extrapolated to the size of the current population suggest that there are approximately and million annual shingles cases  respectively 
shingles is largely a disease of the aged or aging  with over of all cases occurring in individuals over the age of  and approximately occurring in individuals over the age of due to the aging of the population in many industrialized countries  as well as the increasing use of immunosuppressive agents in transplant patients and the increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients from cancer therapy  the incidence of shingles is expected to increase 
it is estimated that approximately of all persons in the us will suffer from shingles at some point during their lifetime 
the symptoms associated with shingles generally include localized lesions  rash and pain 
in certain cases the patient may notice localized prodomal pain prior to the appearance of any lesions  however  the first symptom of shingles is generally lesions that will continue to form for a week or more 
while such lesions generally follow the path of nerves that emanate from the spinal cord around the torso  the infection is also commonly found on the face  neck  and in certain cases  systemically 
within several weeks  the lesions in the infected areas will typically begin to crust over and heal  and these dermatological symptoms generally will resolve within a month 
in rare instances  lesions may never appear  but pain will be present 
fewer than of patients experience significant systemic symptoms from shingles  such as fever  headache  malaise  or fatigue 
the pain associated with an episode of shingles is attributed to damage caused to the nerve fibers by the replication of vzv and the subsequent inflammation associated with the infection 
pain symptoms are commonly described as a burning sensation  with bouts of stabbing and shooting pain  often set off by contact with the infected area 
the majority of shingles patients experience acute pain for several weeks in connection with their active infection 
for some patients  shingles related pain does not resolve when the rash and lesions heal but  rather  continues for months  or possibly years 
persistent shingles related pain that lasts more than several months is referred to as phn  and it is the most common complication of shingles 
approximately of all shingles patients experience phn  although the incidence of phn is more prevalent in patients over years of age 
previous studies have established that additional risk factors for phn include greater acute pain intensity  severity of the dermatological symptoms or lesions  and the presence and greater severity of a painful prodrome preceding the lesions or rash 
valacyclovir  acyclovir and famciclovir are oral antivirals currently indicated and approved by the fda  and regulatory agencies in many other countries  to treat shingles 
these drugs are referred to as pan herpetic drugs  as they are used to treat infections caused by various herpes viruses  including herpes simplex and  and vzv 
ims data indicates that the majority of the approximately billion in annual sales these drugs generate in the us in was for use in treating infections caused by herpes simplex and  and not vzv 
unlike those drugs  fv only demonstrates antiviral activity against vzv  and not the other herpes viruses 
based upon an analysis by ims health  inc ims data  we estimate that approximately of all retail prescriptions for valacyclovir  acyclovir and famciclovir are for the treatment of herpes zoster  and that the size of the market for oral antivirals to treat shingles is in excess of million per year in the us limitations of current therapies data from various clinical trials demonstrate that a seven day administration of valacyclovir  acyclovir  or famciclovir  beginning less than hours after the first appearance of a shingles related rash or lesion  can lessen the duration of the dermatological symptoms associated with shingles  and the average duration of shingles related pain 
however  these currently approved antiviral drugs  when used to treat shingles  have a number of limitations  including the following no approved label for the reduction of acute pain and phn 
currently  there are no oral antiviral therapies indicated for the reduction or prevention of shingles related acute pain or phn 
there is also no cure for phn per se  rather  treatment of phn is accomplished through pain management 
the most commonly prescribed medications are opioids  antidepressants  anticonvulsants  or a topical lidocaine or 
table of contents capsaicin patch 
previously published clinical data demonstrate that antiviral therapy can reduce the duration of shingles related pain and phn  and we believe a more potent  faster acting anti vzv compound  such as fv  has the potential to more rapidly inhibit the replication of vzv  thus reducing shingles related nerve damage and therefore further reducing acute pain and phn 
we believe an antiviral therapy that can further reduce the severity and or duration of acute pain and the prevalence of phn may have a significant competitive advantage relative to the currently available antiviral shingles therapies 
inconvenient dosing 
due to their suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties and potency against vzv  current pan herpetic oral antiviral therapies require shingles patients to take three to five oral doses each day for seven to ten days 
specifically  current dosing regimens for the treatment of shingles are as follows valacyclovir  mg  three times per day  famciclovir mg  three times per day  and acyclovir mg  five times per day 
given the fact that many shingles patients are elderly  are taking other medications  and may have difficulty ingesting large tablets or caplets  such dosing regimens are inconvenient and can result in non compliance  resulting in less than optimal treatment outcomes 
we believe that an effective antiviral therapy that can be administered via convenient  once a day oral administration may have a competitive advantage relative to current shingles therapies 
current antiviral drugs must be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function 
although current pan herpetic oral antiviral therapies are generally safe and well tolerated in shingles patients  dosing of valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir must be adjusted for certain patients with insufficient renal kidney function to avoid potential adverse events 
clinical data from our phase i trials of fv in healthy volunteers indicated that fv was generally well tolerated and does not appear to be primarily excreted through the kidneys 
while its safety profile will be further studied in the ongoing phase ii trial and any future clinical trials we may conduct  we believe the dosing of fv will not need to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function 
we believe that an oral antiviral therapy that has a similar or better safety profile to valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir  and is not required to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function  may have a competitive advantage over currently approved shingles therapies 
we believe there is a significant unmet need for a more potent  faster acting  once a day oral antiviral agent  such as fv  which has the potential to reduce the incidence  severity  and duration of shingles related symptoms  including rash  lesions  acute pain and phn 
due to its demonstrated potency and ability to rapidly penetrate cells in vitro  we also believe that the amount of fv necessary to fully inhibit the viral replication of vzv may be significantly lower than that of the current antiviral therapies  resulting in smaller doses and potentially fewer side effects 
we also believe that the pharmacokinetic properties of fv  as observed in preclinical studies and our phase i trials  may provide for less frequent oral dosing than valacyclovir  acyclovir and famciclovir 
fv clinical trials phase ii 
in may  we initiated a well controlled  double blind study phase ii clinical trial comparing two doses of fv to an active control valacyclovir 
the trial protocol calls for the enrollment and randomization of approximately patients  aged years and older with shingles associated pain  who will be equally randomized to one of three treatment arms mg fv administered once daily  mg fv administered once daily  and  mg valacyclovir administered three times per day 
in addition to further evaluating its safety  the primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of fv in reducing the severity and duration of shingles related acute pain  the incidence of phn  the time to lesion healing  and the use of concomitant pain medications 
there are planned safety assessments by an independent data safety and monitoring board dsmb when each quartile of patients has been enrolled and has completed days of follow up  as well as an interim efficacy analysis on the primary endpoint when the second quartile of patients has completed days of follow up 
in january  we indicated that the dsmb had reviewed safety data from the first quartile of subjects and recommended to continue the trial as planned 
we expect the second quartile dsmb review and interim efficacy analysis to occur shortly 
further  we anticipate completing enrollment in and having top line data available from this trial in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents phase i 
in february  we completed a blinded  placebo controlled multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of five oral doses of fv   and mg administered once daily and mg administered twice daily  each for seven days in healthy subjects aged to each dose cohort consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
the results of the trial demonstrated that there were no serious adverse events and fv appeared to be generally well tolerated at all dose levels 
further  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses studied maintained mean plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded its ec 
for at least hours  supporting the evaluation of once a day dosing of fv in future clinical trials 
the ec 
represents the concentration of drug that is required for inhibition of viral replication in vitro 
in january  we also completed a blinded  placebo controlled phase i trial to evaluate single and multiple doses of fv in healthy subjects years of age and older 
one dose cohort consisted of twelve healthy subjects  ten of whom received a single administration of mg of fv and two of whom received placebo  and the second cohort also consisted of twelve healthy subjects  ten of whom received mg of fv administered twice daily for seven consecutive days and two of whom received placebo 
the results of this trial demonstrated no significant safety differences between these subjects and those from the multiple ascending dose trial 
in august  we completed a phase i single ascending dose clinical trial of fv the blinded  placebo controlled trial evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of four doses of fv in six cohorts of healthy volunteers    and mg  as well as a two mg food effect groups 
each cohort consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
there were no serious adverse events observed and the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated in the trial 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses evaluated in the trial maintained plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded its ec 
for at least hours 
in december  we completed a blinded  placebo controlled single ascending dose phase i clinical trial of fv  which was conducted under an exploratory ind 
the trial was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of three oral doses of fv  and mg in healthy volunteers to years of age 
each of the three dose cohorts consisted of six subjects that received fv and two that received placebo 
the results of the trial demonstrated that there were no serious adverse events observed and that the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated 
in addition  pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all three doses achieved plasma levels of cf  the active form of fv  which exceeded the ec  with the mg dose maintaining such levels for approximately eight hours 
hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors modified nucleoside inhibitors nucleoside analogues is a class of small molecule compounds that have a proven record of success as antiviral agents 
these natural small chemical compounds function as the building blocks of human and viral genetic material  commonly referred to as deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna 
modified nucleoside inhibitors are small molecules that effectively target viral polymerases  the enzymes that replicate viral genetic information 
mimicking the role of natural or unmodified nucleosides  nucleoside inhibitors are incorporated by viral polymerases into replicating viral genomes 
this event leads to chain termination  preventing the virus from reproducing its genetic material 
modified nucleosides need to be phosphorylated to their corresponding triphosphates by the host cell kinases 
in many cases  however  nucleoside analogues are poor substrates for the kinases and the pharmacologically active triphosphate species cannot be considered as possible drug candidates due to their high instability and poor cellular permeation 
in many cases  the limiting step in this process is represented by the conversion to the corresponding monophosphate 
our collaborators at cardiff university in wales  united kingdom cardiff have developed the aryloxy phosphoramidate protide approach  which allows the delivery of the monophosphorylated nucleoside analogue nucleotide into the cell  bypassing the first phosphorylation step 
cardiff has previously reported the successful application of this protide approach to methyl purines adenosine and guanosine 
through our ongoing research and collaboration with cardiff  we have synthesized an extensive array of protide derivatives of c methyl guanosine nucleotide analogues that target the rna dependent rna polymerase nsb of

in the first half of we selected inx as our lead compound and initiated ind enabling studies 
we have completed the requisite good laboratory practices glp preclinical studies needed to support the filing of an ind for inx with the fda

nm  b ec 
nm  and a ec 
nm  cell based replicon assays 
in addition  inx exhibited a high degree of synergy in combination with ribavirin in the hcv genotype b replicon assay 
in vitro data from primary human hepatocytes indicated that inx is rapidly and efficiently converted to the active triphosphate with a half life of approximately hours 
furthermore  oral dosing studies in multiple animal species indicate that inx is effectively extracted by the liver through first pass metabolism and converted to levels of active triphosphate predicted to exceed those required to exhibit antiviral activity 
the pharmacokinetics in these studies support evaluating inx under once a day dosing in future clinical trials 
market opportunity for the treatment of hcv hcv is a virus that is a common cause of viral hepatitis  an inflammation of the liver 
hcv infection is contracted by contact with blood or other body fluids of an individual infected with hcv 
hcv disease progression occurs over a period of to years  during which patients generally do not exhibit any symptoms of the disease 
hcv is a leading cause of chronic liver disease  including cirrhosis  organ failure and cancer  and the leading cause of death from liver disease in the us hcv is often found among hemodialysis patients  hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions before hcv is now transmitted primarily through the sharing of needles used for injection drug use and by pregnant women infecting their children in utero 
the world health organization estimates that approximately million people worldwide are infected with hcv as of of these individuals  it is estimated that approximately million are chronically infected with an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer 
hcv is responsible for more than half of all liver cancer cases and two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world 
the center for disease control cdc estimates that approximately million people in the us are chronically infected with hcv as of  yet projects that only about  of these patients are currently under treatment 
because symptoms of this chronic disease do not typically appear until its later stages  carriers often do not realize they are infected  and therefore do not seek treatment 
current therapies to treat hcv infections generated worldwide sales of approximately billion in  and sales of these products and new approved products are forecast to increase to more than billion by and billion by there are several genotypes and subtypes of hcv 
at least six major genotypes of hcv have been identified  each with multiple subtypes 
genotypes are designated with numbers genotypes and subtypes with letters 
hcv genotypes    and are found worldwide  but their prevalence varies among geographic regions 
genotype and its subtypes a and b are the most common genotype globally  accounting for approximately of infections 
patients with genotype or represent approximately of the worldwide chronically infected hcv population and the remaining is comprised of genotypes through limitations of current therapies for the treatment of hcv infection the current standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c infection is a combination of once weekly pegylated interferon alpha and twice daily oral administration of ribavirin for up to weeks  depending on the hcv genotype 
interferon alpha is administrated by injection and results in abnormally high levels of this cytokine circulating systemically throughout the body 
therapy with interferon alpha causes a number of side effects in many patients  including depression  a drop in blood cell count and flu like symptoms 
these symptoms may be experienced during the entire week course of therapy that is standard for treatment of patients infected with hcv genotype  who are the most difficult patient group to treat 
these side effects may make patients feel worse than the foregoing treatment  which reduces their motivation to initiate or continue therapy 
many patients take additional drugs to treat these side effects  further increasing the cost and the risk of additional side effects 
as a result  poor compliance with the current standard of care may decrease the patient response rate 
in addition to these side effects  current therapies do not cure the disease or provide sustained elimination of the virus  called sustained virologic response svr  for a large proportion of chronically infected patients 

table of contents for example  approximately percent of the genotype patients  which represent the largest portion of hcv patients in the us  europe and japan  do not achieve a svr six months after the end of the treatment with the current standard of care 
due to the lack of alternative treatments  patients without a svr response have no other treatment option but to undergo a second week course of interferon alpha based therapy with a different brand of interferon alpha  the outcome of which is generally sub optimal 
in order to improve the treatment outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis c and reduce or eliminate the side effects and toxicities associated with the current standard of care  there are a number of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies pursuing the development of various classes of antiviral compounds that can directly inhibit the replication of hcv by specifically targeting different proteins and enzymes of the virus 
accordingly  direct acting antiviral  or daa  therapy is now emerging as a potential complement  or possibly an alternative  to the current standard of care 
several classes of daa compounds are currently in clinical development  including protease inhibitors  which are the most clinically advanced class  nucleoside and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors  and other emerging novel antivirals that inhibit different molecular targets of hcv 
to date  data from a number of clinical trials evaluating various direct acting antivirals in combination with standard of care demonstrate superior svr rates as compared to standard of care alone 
notwithstanding the improved treatment outcomes reflected by these trials combining a single daa with standard of care  it is believed that two or more classes of direct acting antivirals will ultimately be used in combination with the current standard of care  or possibly as its replacement  in order to optimize the potential of direct antiviral therapy 
this would be akin to what has evolved in the treatment of hiv aids 
there are currently two approaches to inhibiting the activity of the hcv polymerase 
in general  polymerase inhibitors can be assigned to two broad categories on the basis of their chemical structure and mechanism of action nucleoside analogue inhibitors and non nucleoside analogue inhibitors 
nucleoside analogues are generally converted to nucleotide analogues by host cell kinases 
nucleoside analogues target the active site of the polymerase and they can either compete with natural nucleoside triphosphate ntp substrates or and act as chain terminators  or cause of a mutational error catastrophe by being incorporated into the elongating nascent rna molecule 
the second category of compounds is the non nucleoside analogue inhibitors  which typically bind to allosteric surface cavities of the hcv polymerase 
the activity of non nucleoside compounds depends on their ability to bind relatively tightly to specific amino acid sequences and often involves multiple molecular interactions 
if any of these interactions are missing due to a change in the polymerase sequence  then binding cannot occur properly 
the probability of this happening tends to be higher with non nucleoside than with nucleoside nucleotide analogues 
we are focused on developing the use of protide nucleotide analogues that mimic nucleotides normally recognized by the enzyme as it builds a new copy of the viral genome 
similar to current hiv aids therapy  where nucleosides have become a cornerstone of combination therapy  we believe nsb nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors will play a similar role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c infections 
certain potential advantages that nucleoside nucleotide analogues have over protease inhibitors  as well as non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors  are as follows nucleoside nucleotide polymerase analogues have the highest genetic barrier to resistance due to their ability to bind in the active site of the hcv polymerase and mutations in the active site significantly reduce the fitness of the virus 
nucleoside nucleotide polymerase analogues exhibit antiviral activity against all the various genotypes of hcv 
protease and non nucleoside inhibitors have typically shown variable potency against hcv genotypes a and b  and reduced or no activity against genotypes a  a or this genotype specificity suggests that protease and non nucleoside inhibitors would need to be combined with a nucleoside analogue to provide therapeutic coverage across the breadth of hcv genotypes found globally 
nucleoside nucleotide polymerase analogues do not require boosting with ritonavir 
several of the protease inhibitors currently in development require boosting with ritonavir to enhance their pharmacokinetics 
the addition of ritonavir to the treatment regimen for hcv may require extensive drug drug interactions studies prior to licensure 

table of contents the fda has not yet approved any direct acting antivirals for the treatment of infections caused by hcv  but a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing nucleoside nucleotide and non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitors 
to our knowledge  the most advanced nucleoside nucleotide and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors are currently in phase ii clinical trials 
staphylococcal vaccine in  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with wyeth since acquired by pfizer  inc pfizer in for the development of active vaccines against staphylococcus from our mscramm protein platform 
in consideration for this license  we received an upfront payment and the right to receive future milestone payments  financial support of certain research and development activities  and royalty payments on product sales 
pfizer is responsible for all clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of the vaccine 
in january  we announced that pfizer had initiated recruitment for a randomized  double blind phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and immunogenicity of three ascending dose levels of a antigen s 
aureus vaccine saag in healthy adults 
upon the initiation of this trial we received a milestone payment of million and are eligible to receive future regulatory milestone payment  as well as royalties on any future net sales 
market opportunity for staphylococcal vaccine the centers for disease control and prevention cdc as of estimates that each year  approximately million infections and  associated deaths occur in us hospitals  making nosocomial infections one of the leading overall causes of death 
nosocomial infections constitute a significant economical burden  as they cause a large range of additional costs to health services  patients and society 
these include material and personnel costs as well as costs related to lost productivity  disability or caring activities 
most of these costs are directly related to the prolonged hospital stay that becomes inevitable for many patients suffering from a nosocomial infection 
the number of extra days a patient has to spend in the hospital varies depending on the type of infection he or she is suffering from  and can extend from days to weeks 
in  the cdc estimated the prolonged stay at days for a urinary tract infection  days for an infection at the site of a surgery procedure  days for a bloodstream infection  and days for pneumonia 
further  the cdc estimated the total additional costs of hospital associated infections at nearly billion per year  ranging from for a urinary tract infection to  or more for prolonged bloodstream infections 
s 
aureus is the most frequent pathogen in nosocomial infections  associated with many different types of infection and a worse clinical outcome in a wide range of patients 
the emergence of the hard to treat mrsa  in both the hospital and more recently  the community setting  and the additional costs of treatment have provided a strong rationale to investigate preventive strategies against s 
aureus infection 
from a practical point of view  vaccination appears to be highly feasible for several key target groups such as patients undergoing planned surgeries  the approximately  patients receiving end stage renal disease therapy in the us as of  patients receiving chronic long term care  and the elderly 
staphylococcal vaccine clinical trials phase i 
in january  we announced that pfizer had initiated recruitment for a randomized  double blind phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and immunogenicity of three ascending dose levels of a antigen s 
aureus vaccine saag in healthy adults 
the saag vaccine contains an antigen originating from our mscramm protein platform 
the primary outcome measures of the trial are an assessment of safety and tolerability as determined by local reactions  systemic events  and adverse events 
the secondary outcome measures include an assessment of immunogenicity one month post vaccination and the effect of the saag vaccine on the number of s 
aureus bacteria that naturally occur on the skin and within the nose 

table of contents aurexis aurexis is a humanized monoclonal antibody we have evaluated as a first line therapy  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of serious  life threatening s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
aurexis targets clumping factor a  clfa a protein found on the surface of virtually all strains of s 
aureus  including mrsa 
we have completed an exploratory patient phase ii trial of aurexis in patients with confirmed s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
the results suggested that a single dose of aurexis  administered intravenously  was generally safe and well tolerated in these patients 
aurexis has been granted fast track designation by the fda for the adjunctive treatment of s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
due to our strategic focus on developing oral antivirals  and more specifically advancing the development of fv  inx and other compounds in our hcv polymerase program  we currently do not intend to allocate any additional resources to advance the clinical development of aurexis 
we continue to seek licensing  co development collaborations  or other business arrangements that can provide financial resources and other synergistic capabilities to support its further development 
market opportunity for the treatment of s 
aureus infections as of  it was estimated that approximately  invasive mrsa infections occurred in the united states in and these infections were associated with death in almost  cases 
the economic burden of mrsa infections is substantial 
mrsa hospitalizations cost nearly double that for non mrsa stays  for mrsa stays compared with  for non mrsa stays 
the average length of stay in the hospital for a patient with mrsa infection was more than double that for non mrsa stays days versus days 
these data support the need for the development of newer therapies with novel mechanisms of action designed to either prevent or mitigate the progression of sab 
there are at least four categories of benefits that may be realized by adjunctive aurexis therapy first  reduced mortality and morbidity complications associated with mrsa and methicillin sensitive s 
aureus bacteremia  second  reduced length of stay in the icu  thereby reducing the costs associated with the overall hospital stay  third  reduced antibiotics utilization consistent with cdc and nih guidelines  thereby reducing the pressure on the development of antibiotic resistance  and fourth  reduced rates of relapse of infection 
moreover  the ability to be used prophylactically in high risk patients gives aurexis a unique advantage over antibiotics where their prophylactic use is discouraged 
aurexis clinical trials phase ii 
in may  we reported the results from a patient phase ii clinical trial of aurexis  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bacteremia in hospitalized patients 
patients were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy in combination with either aurexis  at mg kg  or placebo 
both aurexis and the placebo were administered intravenously as a single dose 
in this trial  standard of care antibiotic therapy was selected by the individual investigators 
subjects were followed for days or until early termination from the trial 
the primary objectives of the phase ii trial were to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics  and biological activity of a single dose of aurexis 
in the trial  aurexis appeared to be generally well tolerated 
further  favorable trends were observed in the composite primary endpoint of mortality  relapse rate and infection related complications  and a number of secondary endpoints and ad hoc analyses  including the progression in the severity of sepsis  the number of days in the intensive care unit  and the resolution of complications associated with s 
aureus bacteremia 
the phase ii trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate statistically significant differences among the treatment arms in measures of efficacy 
accordingly  these preliminary findings were not statistically significant 
hiv integrase inhibitors in september  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license from the university of georgia research foundation  ugarf for intellectual property covering a series of hiv integrase inhibitors 
in august 
table of contents  we announced that we had assigned our hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitor preclinical program a higher priority than our hiv preclinical program and had realigned our internal resources in order to maximize the potential of accelerating our hcv program 
in july  we terminated the license agreement  and all intellectual property covering hiv integrase inhibitors reverted back to ugarf 
the conclusion of this agreement did not have a material effect on our financial position or operations 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that develops differentiated products that can prevent and treat serious infections 
in order to achieve this strategic goal  we intend to employ the following strategies focus our resources on the development of our antiviral product candidates 
in the near tern  we plan to focus our resources on further developing our most advanced antiviral compounds  fv for the treatment of shingles and inx for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  through the completion of their respective proof of concept clinical trials 
more specifically  we plan to complete a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial of fv in shingles patients in the fourth quarter of  and file an ind and initiate a phase i clinical trial for inx in the first half of  with the goal of completing a phase ib trial of inx in hcv infected patients in conduct preclinical studies on potential back up and follow on hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors that possess different chemical structures and properties than inx we have a number of potential back up and follow on hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors that we are evaluating in various stages of research and preclinical development 
continue to support our existing mscramm programs  including our mscramm based license and collaboration agreement with pfizer for the development of staphylococcal vaccines as needed 
pfizer recently initiated a phase i trial of a staphylococcal vaccine  which includes intellectual property covered under our license agreement with them 
pfizer is responsible for all preclinical  clinical and commercial activities relating to the program  while we maintain intellectual property covered under the license and provide additional research support as needed 
further  we currently do not plan to allocate any additional developmental resources to our mscramm protein and antibody platform  including aurexis 
however  we do intend to continue to maintain the intellectual property and to pursue licensing  co development collaborations or other business arrangements that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development and commercialization of our mscramm protein and antibody platform 
accelerate and sustain growth through collaborations 
we intend to establish strategic licenses and collaborations  partnerships or alliances with leading pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies with greater financial  clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization capabilities that we believe can accelerate the development and or commercialization of our antiviral product candidates after we have independently established their clinical proof of concept 
research and development our research and development expense in and was million and million  respectively 
we plan to focus our resources primarily on the clinical development of our most advanced antiviral compounds  namely fv  which we are developing for the treatment of shingles  and inx  our nucleotide polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
sales and marketing we currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities  and currently have no plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally 
at this time  we anticipate partnering or collaborating with  or licensing certain rights to  other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the 
table of contents development of our antiviral product candidates through late stage clinical development  and if successful  commercialization 
however  other than our existing license agreement with pfizer  we may decide not to license any development and commercialization rights to our product candidates in the future 
manufacturing we do not own or operate any facilities in which we could formulate and manufacture our product candidates 
we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce all materials required to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  cgmp with oversight by our management team 
we currently rely on a single group of manufacturers for the preclinical and clinical trial materials of each of our product candidates 
however  we have identified alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce materials for our preclinical and clinical trial requirements 
if a contract manufacture fails to deliver on schedule  or at all  it could delay or interrupt the development process and affect our operating results 
we have used contract manufacturers to produce clinical trial material for use in the clinical trials of fv as of december   we have a maximum purchase commitment of million under these agreements and have no other long term  non cancellable financial obligations under these agreements 
we have recently begun to use a different group of contract manufacturers to produce clinical trial material for use in our planned clinical trials of inx as of december   our maximum purchase commitment is million under these agreements  and we have no other long term  non cancellable financial obligations under these agreements 
competition our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and government regulation 
key competitive factors in our industry include  among others  the ability to successfully advance the development of a product candidate through preclinical and clinical trials  the efficacy  toxicological  safety  resistance or cross resistance  and dosing profile of a product or product candidate  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  if ever achieved  reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of competing products and pharmaceutical products in general  the availability of raw materials and qualified contract manufacturing and manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
if ultimately approved  fv  inx  or any product candidate from our current or future development programs would compete against existing therapies or other product candidates in various stages of clinical development that we believe could become available in the future for the treatment of shingles  chronic hepatitis c and the prevention of staphylococcal infections 
some of the large pharmaceutical companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates  if approved  include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  novartis and merck in the shingles market and merck and roche in the hepatitis c market 
in addition to existing therapies  there are many other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies developing numerous direct acting antiviral product candidates across various classes of compounds for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  including  but not limited to  abbott  anadys pharmaceuticals  bristol myers squibb  gilead  idenix pharmaceuticals  johnson and johnson  merck  novartis  pfizer  pharmasset  roche  and vertex  which may compete with inx or any other hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitor we may develop in the future 
most of the product candidates being developed by these companies  and in particular those that belong to the class of compounds referred to as protease inhibitors  are further advanced in their clinical development than inx further  idenix pharmaceuticals and pharmasset are developing nucleotide analogues  which are similar to the approach we are using for inx moreover  their compounds have advanced further in clinical development and are currently in phase ii clinical trials 
while there are many direct acting antiviral compounds in various stages of clinical development  none have been approved for sale by the fda or emea 
accordingly  the competitive landscape for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c is expected to be highly dynamic over the next five to ten years 
in order to compete effectively in this market in the future  we believe a direct acting antiviral will need to demonstrate a favorable 
table of contents toxicity profile  superior potency  high resistance barriers  and be amenable to combination with other direct acting antivirals in a low fixed oral dose 
developing pharmaceutical product candidates is a highly competitive  expensive and risky activity with a long business cycle 
many organizations  including the large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies that have existing products on the market or in clinical development that could compete with fv or inx  have substantially more capital resources than we have  and much greater capabilities and experience than we have in research and discovery  designing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  operating in a highly regulated environment  manufacturing drug substances and drug products  and marketing and sales 
our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates and achieving broad market acceptance once they are approved 
our competitors drugs or product candidates may be more effective  have fewer negative side effects  be more convenient to administer  have a more favorable drug resistance profile  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we  or our potential collaborators  may commercialize 
new drugs  or classes of drugs from competitors  may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we are able to successfully develop them or  if approved  before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing them 
we anticipate that we or our collaborators will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and drug classes enter the market and advanced technologies or new drug targets become available 
if our product candidates do not demonstrate any competitive advantages over existing drugs  new drugs or product candidates  we or our future collaborators may terminate the development or commercialization of our product candidates at any time in the future 
we anticipate that our product candidates  and in particular fv if successfully developed and approved  will compete directly or indirectly with existing generic drugs  or drugs that will be generic by the time our product candidates may be approved for sale 
generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by intellectually property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication will generally impose significant pricing pressure on competing drugs 
intellectual property rights and patents patents and other proprietary intellectual rights are crucial in our business  and are essential to justify the development of our product candidates 
we have sought  and intend to continue to seek  patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage for our product candidates 
in order to protect these rights  know how and trade secrets  we typically require employees  consultants  collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us  generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time  and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone s benefit but ours 
as patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until patents are issued  unless earlier publication is required under applicable law or in connection with patents filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct or as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions described in these pending patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
furthermore  the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  and therefore  the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their enforceability cannot be predicted 
we cannot be sure that any patents will be issued or that patents licensed to us will be issued from any of these patent applications or  should any patents issue  that we will be provided with adequate protection against potentially competitive products 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that patents issued or licensed to us will be of any commercial value  or that private parties or competitors will not successfully challenge these patents or circumvent our patent position in the us or abroad 
in the absence of adequate patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors who develop comparable technology or products 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of the uruguay round agreements act  patents filed on or after june  have a term of years from the date of filing  irrespective of the period of time it may take for the patent to ultimately issue 
this may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to our products as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  a sponsor may obtain marketing exclusivity for a period of time following fda approval of certain drug applications  regardless of patent status  if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies were used to support the marketing application for the drug 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of applicable patent terms for a period equal to one half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an ind and the filing of the corresponding new drug application nda plus the period of time between the filing of the nda and fda approval  with a five year maximum patent extension 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing exclusivity provisions of this law 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our intellectual property and product candidates in clinical development  both in the us and in other countries 
litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce our patents  or to protect our trade secrets  and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts 
we intend to file applications as appropriate for patents describing the composition of matter of our drug candidates  the proprietary processes for producing such compositions  and the uses of our products and drug candidates 
the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore  their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our issued patents  those licensed to us  and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted there under may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential drug product candidate  it is possible that our patent rights in any of our product candidates may expire before such products can be approved for sale and commercialized  or that our relevant patent rights will remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
expiration of patents or rights we directly own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights for the technology  inventions and improvements we consider important to our product candidates  defend our patents and proprietary rights  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
we have an exclusive global license to an issued patent and pending patent applications with respect to fv in the us and internationally 
the earliest projected expiration date for patents which may issue from those patent applications is approximately  while many of the patent applications will not expire until at least we have an exclusive global license to multiple pending patent applications  including a corresponding pct application  relating to inx and a number of our preclinical hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
the earliest projected expiration date for any patents that may issue with claims related to inx is approximately we currently own or are licensed under numerous patents and patent applications in the us and foreign countries related to our mscramm protein platform 
we have four issued us patents relating to the clfa 
table of contents protein found on s 
aureus and antibodies to the protein 
these patents will expire in    and respectively  if not extended 
there are no corresponding foreign rights available for the clfa protein and nucleic acid sequences 
two issued us patents and their international counterparts relate to aurexis and contain claims to monoclonal antibodies recognizing the clfa protein 
the us patents will expire in if not extended 
we have two issued us patents and corresponding foreign rights relating to multi component vaccines for staphylococci 
these patents will expire in if not extended 
licenses in  we acquired the rights to an exclusive worldwide license from cardiff  which includes fv  a bicyclic nucleoside analogue for the treatment of vzv infections

pfizer  inc in august  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and development collaboration agreement with wyeth subsequently acquired by pfizer in under which we granted pfizer exclusive rights to our mscramm proteins for use in the development and commercialization of human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
under the agreement  the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration are the responsibility of pfizer 
we may terminate this agreement if pfizer fails to use reasonable commercial efforts to bring related products to market 
pfizer may terminate the agreement without 
table of contents cause upon six months notice 
otherwise  this agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all of the licensed patents in pursuant to this agreement  we have received million in an upfront license fee and annual research support payments from pfizer as of december  we are entitled to receive minimum research support payments of million per year until commercial sales reach a targeted threshold for any product developed under this agreement 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon the commencement of each phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical trial  the filing of a biologic drug application and regulatory approval of a licensed product 
if all such milestones are achieved relative to at least one licensed product  we would be entitled to receive a minimum of million in milestone payments under the agreement 
the maximum amount of milestone payments we could receive with respect to all licensed products is million 
finally  we are also entitled to royalties on net sales of related products manufactured  sold or distributed by pfizer 
in january  we announced that pfizer had commenced enrollment in a phase i study with a staphylococcal vaccine that includes an antigen covered under this license agreement  which resulted in a milestone payment to us 
pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in the us and most foreign markets  any revenue associated with the sale of our product candidates  if approved  will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers 
third party payers include various government health authorities such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms which administers medicare and medicaid in the us  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services  including pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may ultimately not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
the us and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare and pharmaceutical products 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before any of our product candidates are ever approved for sale 
in addition  the adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
further  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
the marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidates 
we  and our existing collaborators  intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale  however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage  reimbursement  or pricing  if any 
regulatory matters overview the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  distribution  promotion  sale and export  reporting and record keeping of drug product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  principally the us food and drug administration  fda and corresponding state agencies  and regulatory agencies in foreign countries 
non compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of the clinical development of a product candidate  manufacturing and marketing  failure of the government to grant marketing approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals  fines  injunctions  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 

table of contents us regulatory approval pursuant to fda regulations  we are required to successfully undertake a long and rigorous development process before any of our product candidates can be marketed or sold in the us this regulatory process typically includes the following steps the completion of satisfactory preclinical studies under the fda s glp regulation  the submission and acceptance of an ind that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  obtaining the approval of an institutional review board irb at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials  the successful completion of a series of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety  purity  potency and efficacy of any product candidate for its intended use  which conform to the fda s good clinical practice gcp regulations  the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to fda mandated current good manufacturing practices cgmps  and the submission to  and review and approval by  the fda of a nda or a bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product 
successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that this process will result in the granting of an approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all or that we will have sufficient financial resources to see the process through to completion 
preclinical studies preclinical studies generally include laboratory  or in vitro  evaluation of a product candidate  its chemistry  formulation  stability and toxicity  as well as certain in vivo animal studies to assess its potential safety and biologic activity 
we must submit the results of these preclinical studies  together with other information  including manufacturing records  analytical data and the clinical trial protocol  to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials 
an ind generally becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within this day time period  raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold 
if one or more of our product candidates is placed on clinical hold  we will be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the fda before we could begin  or continue  clinical trials of such product candidates 
preclinical studies supportive of an ind generally take a year or more to complete  and there is no guarantee that an ind based on those studies will become effective  allowing human clinical testing to begin 
certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the fda s glp regulations and the us department of agriculture s animal welfare act 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of the studies  requiring such studies to be conducted again 
clinical trials this clinical trial phase of drug development follows a successful ind submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety  tolerability  efficacy and dosage of an investigational new drug substance in humans  as well as the ability to produce the drug substance in accordance with the fda s cgmp  requirements 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the efficacy of the product candidate 
each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the fda  as part of the ind  prior to beginning the trial 
each trial must be reviewed  approved and conducted under the auspices of an irb and  with limited exceptions  requires the patient s informed consent to participate in the trial 
sponsors  investigators  and irbs also must satisfy extensive gcps  including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects  
table of contents complying with the protocol and investigational plan  adequately monitoring the clinical trial  and reporting serious adverse events on a timely basis 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical trials to support a nda or bla for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase i  ii and iii  with phase iv clinical trials often conducted after marketing approval has been granted 
the fda may require sponsors to conduct phase iv clinical trials to study certain safety issues 
data from these activities are compiled in a nda or a bla for submission to the fda requesting approval to market the drug 
these phases may be compressed  may overlap  or may be omitted in some circumstances 
phase i after an ind becomes effective  phase i human clinical trials can begin 
a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or in some cases  patients with the medical condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used 
generally  the purpose of a phase i trial is to assess a product candidate s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate it 
absorption  metabolism  distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage 
phase i trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single doses as well as multiple doses 
phase ii during phase ii trials  a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to i further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks  ii assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions  and iii assess dose tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent phase ii or phase iii trial 
phase ii trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate  and a control group that will not be treated with the product candidate and may receive a placebo or a drug already on the market for the same indication 
phase iii if and when one or more phase ii trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile  one or more phase iii trials are generally undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm clinical efficacy and to further evaluate the safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population  with the goal of evaluating its overall risk benefit relationship 
phase iii trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint  the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate s clinical efficacy 
the successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more phase iii trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a nda or bla for a product candidate 
in the case of product candidates being developed for serious or life threatening diseases  such as hcv  phase i trials may be conducted in patients with the respective disease rather than in healthy volunteers 
these studies may provide initial evidence of activity or efficacy traditionally obtained in phase ii clinical trials  and therefore these trials may be referred to as phase i ii or phase ib clinical trials 
a company may request an end of phase ii meeting with the fda to assess the safety of the dose regimen to be studied in the phase iii clinical trial  to evaluate the planned design of a phase iii trial  and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support a nda 
if a phase iii clinical trial has been the subject of discussion at an end of phase ii meeting  the trial sponsor is eligible for a special protocol assessment  spa by the fda  a process by which the fda  at the request of the sponsor  will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol within days to assess whether it is deemed to be adequate to meet the scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor 
if the fda and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of a phase iii clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a nda or bla  the fda may reduce the understanding to writing 
the spa  however  is not a guarantee of product approval by the fda  or approval of any permissible claims about the product 
throughout the various phases of clinical development  samples of the product candidate made in different batches are tested for stability to establish any shelf life constraints 
in addition  large scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed 
phase i  ii  and iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time 
table of contents period  if at all 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical development that are conducted under an ind and may  at its discretion  reevaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the subject or patient 
the fda  the sponsor  or an irb may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval or advancement to the next stage of development 
additionally  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development 
furthermore  irbs  which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted  have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons  including safety issues 
a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk 
clinical trials performed outside the us under an ind must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the us the fda may accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind only if the study is well designed  well conducted  performed by qualified investigators  and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the declaration of helsinki  or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted  whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects 
certain information about clinical trials  including a description of the study  participation criteria  location of study sites  and contact information  is required to be sent to the national institutes of health  nih for inclusion in a publicly accessible database that is available at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results 
in addition  the food and drug administration amendments act of directed the fda to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the nih the results of all controlled clinical studies  other than phase i studies 
new drug and biologics license applications if and when we believe that all the requisite clinical trials for a product candidate have been completed with satisfactory and supporting clinical data  we must submit a nda or bla to the fda in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate in the us among many other items  a nda or bla typically includes the results of all preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods 
the fda must approve the nda or bla prior to the marketing and sale of the related product 
the fda may deny a nda or bla if it believes all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or it may require additional data  including clinical  toxicology  safety or manufacturing data prior to approval 
the fda has days from its receipt of a nda or bla to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for a substantive review before accepting it for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept a nda or bla for filing 
in this event  the nda or bla must be amended with the additional information 
the fda may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
a nda or bla can receive either standard or priority review 
a drug candidate representing a potentially significant improvement in the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of a life threatening or serious disease may receive priority review 
in addition  product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also receive accelerated approval on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit  or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity 
as a condition of approval  the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and 
table of contents well controlled post marketing phase iv clinical trials 
priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval  but may expedite the approval process 
if the results of the fda s evaluation of the nda or bla  and inspection of manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will issue an approval letter 
an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication 
as a condition of nda or bla approval  the fda may require post approval testing  including phase iv trials  and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions  including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
if the fda determines that it cannot approve the application in its present form  it generally issues what is referred to as a complete response letter 
a complete response letter will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda or bla 
if and when those conditions are met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will typically re review the application and possibly issue an approval letter 
however  even after submitting this additional information  the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval 
it can take several years for the fda to approve a nda or bla once it is submitted  and the actual time required for any product candidate to be approved may vary substantially  depending upon the nature  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
we cannot assure you that the fda  or any other similar regulatory agency in another country  will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
post approval regulations if and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval to be marketed and sold  the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use  or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
any fda approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences 
further  drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with cgmp regulations  which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we  or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers  will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of production activities for our current and future product candidates  failure of the fda to grant approval for marketing of such product candidates  and withdrawal  suspension  or revocation of marketing approvals 
if the fda approves one or more of our product candidates  we or our collaborators and our contract manufacturers must provide the fda with certain updated safety  efficacy and manufacturing information 
product changes  as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post approval changes may necessitate additional fda review and approval 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the formulation and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
the labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution of an approved drug or biologic product must also comply with fda and federal trade commission  ftc requirements which include  among others  
table of contents standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda and ftc have very broad enforcement authority  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
the fda s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
moreover  increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the us and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the us or abroad  or the impact such changes could have on our business 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and in some circumstances the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or whether fda regulations  guidance or interpretations will change or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
fast track drug status the fda has developed fast track policies  which provide for the potential for an expedited review of a nda or bla 
however  there is no assurance that the fda will  in fact  accelerate the review process for a fast track product candidate 
fast track status is provided only for those new and novel therapies that are intended to treat persons with life threatening and severely debilitating diseases where there is a defined unmet medical need  especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or the new therapy appears to be significantly superior to existing alternative therapies 
during the development of product candidates that qualify for this status  the fda may expedite consultations and reviews of these experimental therapies 
fast track status also provides for the potential for a priority review  whereby the fda agrees to reduce the time it takes to review a nda or bla 
the fda can base approval of a marketing application for a fast track product on a clinical endpoint or on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
the fda generally requires as a condition of the approval of an application for certain fast track products  additional post approval studies or phase iv clinical studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
further  fast track status allows for a rolling nda or bla submission  whereby portions of the application can be submitted to the fda for review prior to the completion of the entire application 
a rolling submission could result in a reduction in the length of time it would otherwise take the fda to complete its review of the application 
fast track status may be revoked by the fda at any time if the clinical results of a trial fail to continue to support the assertion that the respective product candidate has the potential to address an unmet medical need 
in addition  fast track status may be granted for a specific application of a drug candidate 
aurexis has been granted fast track status 
foreign regulatory approval outside of the us  our ability to market any of our existing or future product candidates will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
the foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized 
table of contents countries generally includes risks that are similar to the fda approval process described above 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations  and the time required to obtain requisite approvals may vary widely from country to country and differ from that required for fda approval 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for a member state  known as the reference member state  to assess an application  with one or more other member states subsequently approving that assessment 
under this procedure  an applicant submits an application  or dossier  and related materials  including a draft summary of product characteristics  draft labeling and package leaflet  to the reference member state and concerned member states 
the reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within days after receipt of a valid application 
within days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report  each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials 
if a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health  the disputed points may eventually be referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks  together with the other information contained in this form k 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  our financial condition  and our ability to raise additional capital in the future or ever become profitable 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our development of our product candidates all of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and their commercial viability remains subject to future preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory approvals and the risks generally inherent in these activities 
if we are unable to successfully advance or develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
in the near term  failure to successfully advance the development of one or more of our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on us 
to date  we have not successfully developed or commercially marketed  distributed or sold any product candidates 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to successfully advance the development of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  have these product candidates approved for sale by the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries  and ultimately  have our product candidates successfully commercialized by us or a strategic collaborator 
we have initiated a phase ii trial for fv  a product candidate we are developing to treat shingles and anticipate completing this trial in the fourth quarter 
further  we plan to file an ind for inx  a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor we are developing to treat chronic hepatitis c infections  and  subject to fda review  initiate a phase i clinical trial in the first half of we cannot assure you that the results of planned or ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials will support or justify the continued development of one or both of these product candidates  or that we will receive approval from the fda  or a similar regulatory authority in other countries  to the advance the development of our product candidates 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous regulatory standards of safety and efficacy before we can advance or complete their clinical development  or they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy testing  preclinical studies and clinical trials  develop acceptable manufacturing processes  and obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates 
despite these efforts  our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other benefits over existing comparable drugs or other product candidates in development  be proven to be safe and effective in current and future preclinical studies or clinical trials  have the desired effects or may include undesirable or unexpected effects  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being formulated and manufactured in commercially suitable quantities and at an acceptable cost  or be successfully commercialized by us or by collaborators 
even if we demonstrate favorable results in preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials  we cannot assure you that the results of later stage clinical trials will be favorable and continue to support the development of our product candidates 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries have experienced significant delays  setbacks and failure in all stages of development  including late stage clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing or early stage clinical trials 
accordingly  results from completed preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials 
furthermore  even if the data collected from preclinical studies or clinical trials involving our product candidates demonstrate a satisfactory safety and efficacy profile  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of an ind application  the 
table of contents initiation or continuation of human clinical trials  or a nda or bla to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the us to market and sell the product 
our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts  the commitment of substantial financial resources  and regulatory approvals prior to advancing into further clinical development or being commercialized by us or collaborators 
we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will successfully progress through the drug development process or will result in commercially viable products 
we do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercialized by us or collaborators for at least several years 
if the results of preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  including those that are subject to existing or future license or collaboration agreements  are unfavorable or delayed  we could be delayed or precluded from the further development or commercialization of our product candidates  which could materially harm our business 
in order to further advance the development of  and ultimately receive regulatory approval to sell  our product candidates  we must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries  as the case may be 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive  complex  may take many years to complete  and have highly uncertain outcomes 
delays  setbacks or failures can occur at any time  or in any phase of preclinical or clinical development  and can result from concerns about safety or toxicity  a lack of demonstrated efficacy or superior efficacy over other similar products that have been approved for sale or are in more advanced stages of development  poor study or trial design  and issues related to the formulation or manufacturing process of the materials used to conduct the trials 
the results of prior preclinical studies or clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results we may observe in later stage clinical trials 
in many cases  product candidates in clinical development may fail to show desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having favorably demonstrated such characteristics in preclinical studies or earlier stage clinical trials 
in addition  we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  preclinical studies and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to advance the development  receive regulatory approval  or commercialize our product candidates  including  but not limited to communications with the fda  or comparable regulatory authorities in different countries  regarding the scope or design of the trial  regulatory authorities or independent review boards irbs not authorizing us to commence or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  enrollment in our clinical trials being delayed or proceeding at a slower pace than we expected  or participants dropping out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipated  our third party contractors  upon whom we rely for conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner  having to suspend or ultimately terminate our clinical trials if participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  irbs or regulators requiring that we hold  suspend or terminate our preclinical studies and clinical trials for various reasons  including non compliance with regulatory requirements  and the supply or quality of drug material necessary to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials being insufficient  inadequate or unavailable 
even if the data collected from preclinical studies or clinical trials involving our product candidates demonstrate a satisfactory safety and efficacy profile  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of an ind application  the initiation or continuation of human clinical trials  or a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the us to market and sell the product 

table of contents we and our collaborators must comply with extensive government regulations in order to advance our product candidates through the development process and ultimately obtain and maintain marketing approval for our products in the us and abroad 
product candidates that we may receive regulatory approval to advance through clinical development and ultimately market and sell are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation 
in the us  the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are also subject to similar regulation by foreign governments to the extent we seek to develop or market them in those countries 
we  or our collaborators  must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  if applicable  with preclinical and clinical data  as well as data supporting an acceptable manufacturing process  that appropriately demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy before they can be approved for the targeted indications 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the us or any foreign market  and we cannot predict whether we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we are developing or plan to develop 
the regulatory review and approval process can take many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity  novelty of  and medical need for the product  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  and involves post marketing surveillance and vigilance and ongoing requirements for post marketing studies or phase iv clinical trials 
in addition  we or our collaborators may encounter delays in  or fail to gain  regulatory approval for our product candidates based upon additional governmental regulation resulting from future legislative  administrative action or changes in fda policy or interpretation during the period of product development 
delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval to advance our product candidates through clinical development and ultimately commercialize them may adversely affect our ability to further develop or commercialize any of our product candidates  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may have or attain  and adversely affect the receipt of potential milestone payments and royalties from the sale of our products or product revenues 
furthermore  any regulatory approvals  if granted  may later be withdrawn 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time  or if post approval safety concerns arise  we or our collaborators may be subject to restrictions or a number of actions  including delays  suspension or termination of clinical trials related to our products  refusal by the fda to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications  product recalls or seizures  suspension of manufacturing  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
additionally  we or our collaborators may voluntarily suspend or terminte the preclinical or clinical development of a product candidate  or withdraw any approved product from the market if we believe that it may pose an unacceptable safety risk to patients  or if the product candidate or approved product no longer meets our business objectives 
the ability to develop or market a pharmaceutical product outside of the us is contingent upon receiving appropriate authorization from the respective foreign regulatory authorities 
foreign regulatory approval processes typically include many  if not all  of the risks and requirements associated with the fda regulatory process for drug development and may include additional risks 

table of contents we have limited experience in the development of small molecule antiviral product candidates and therefore may encounter difficulties developing our product candidates or managing our operations in the future 
our two lead antiviral product candidates  fv and inx  are chemical compounds  also referred to as small molecules 
we have limited experience in the discovery  development and manufacturing of small molecule antiviral compounds 
in order to successfully develop these product candidates  we must supplement our research  clinical development  regulatory  medicinal chemistry  virology and manufacturing capabilities through the addition of key employees  consultants or third party contractors to provide certain capabilities and skill sets that we do not possess 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such qualified employees  consultants or third party contractors with appropriate small molecule antiviral drug development experience 
in the event we cannot attract such capabilities or successfully develop or manage our antiviral pipeline  our business could be materially harmed 
if we are unable to retain or attract key employees  advisors or consultants  we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all  or otherwise manage our business effectively 
we have adopted an operating model that largely relies on the outsourcing of a number of responsibilities and activities to third party consultants and contract organizations in order to advance the development of our product candidates 
therefore  our success depends in part on our ability to retain qualified key management  personnel  and directors to develop  implement and execute our business strategy and operate the company  as well as academic and corporate advisors or consultants to assist us 
we are currently highly dependent upon the efforts of our management team 
in order to develop our product candidates  we need to retain or attract certain personnel  consultants or advisors with experience in a number of disciplines  including research and development  clinical trials  medical matters  government regulation of pharmaceuticals  manufacturing and chemistry  business development  accounting  finance  human resources and information systems 
although we have not had material difficulties in retaining key personnel in the past  we may not be able to continue to do so in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose any key employees  or are unable to attract and retain qualified key personnel  directors  advisors or consultants  the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated and our business may be harmed 
if third party vendors upon whom we rely to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials do not perform or fail to comply with strict regulations  these studies or trials for our product candidates may be delayed  terminated  or fail  or we could incur significant additional expenses 
we have limited resources dedicated to designing  conducting and managing preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have historically relied  and intend to continue to rely  on third parties including clinical research organizations  consultants and principal investigators to assist us in designing  managing  monitoring and conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the drug development process  including certain preclinical studies  the recruitment of sites and patients for participation in our clinical trials  maintenance of good relations with the clinical sites  and ensuring that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the trial protocol and applicable regulations 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily  or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them  we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures  and therefore the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or prove unsuccessful 
further  the fda may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials in the us  or our third party vendors sites  to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to good clinical practices cgp 
if we or the fda determine that our third party vendors are not in compliance with  or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations  we may be forced to delay  repeat or terminate such clinical trials 
any delay  repetition or termination of our clinical trials and preclinical studies could be very costly  result in the elimination of a development program  and materially harm our business 

table of contents if third party contract manufacturers  upon whom we rely to formulate and manufacture our product candidates  do not perform  fail to manufacture according to our specifications or fail to comply with strict regulations  our preclinical studies or clinical trials could be adversely affected and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated or we could incur significant additional expenses 
we do not own or operate any formulation or manufacturing facilities 
we have historically contracted with third party contract manufacturers and organizations to formulate and manufacture the preclinical and clinical materials we use to test our product candidates in development 
we intend to continue to rely on third party contractors  at least for the foreseeable future  to formulate and manufacture these preclinical and clinical materials 
our reliance on third party contract manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of our preclinical studies or clinical trials  or the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
some of these risks include our third party contractors failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support later stage clinical trials for  or the commercialization of  our product candidates  our contract manufacturers failing to manufacture our product candidates according to their own standards  our specifications  current good manufacturing procedures cgmp  or otherwise manufacturing material that we or the fda may deem to be unusable in our clinical trials  our contract manufacturers being unable to increase the scale of  or increase the capacity for  our product candidates 
we may experience a shortage in supply  or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it adversely affects the cost of our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our products at a suitable scale  or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so  our contract manufacturers placing a priority on the manufacture of their own products  or other customers products  our contract manufacturers failing to perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business  and our contract manufacturers plants being closed as a result of regulatory sanctions or a natural disaster 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda  the us drug enforcement administration dea and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with fda mandated cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit their performance  we do not have control over our third party contract manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers  or us  to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the drug manufacturer from the production of other third party products 
these sanctions may include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant pre market approval of drugs  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in the event that we need to change our third party contract manufacturers  our preclinical studies  clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed  adversely affected or terminated  or such a change may result in significantly higher costs 
due to regulatory restrictions inherent in an ind  nda or bla  various steps in the manufacture of our product candidates may be sole sourced 
in accordance with cgmps  changing manufacturers may require the re validation of manufacturing processes and procedures  and may require further preclinical studies or clinical trials to show comparability between the materials produced by different manufacturers 
changing our current or future contract manufacturers may be difficult for us and could be costly  which could result in our inability to manufacture our product candidates for an extended period of time and therefore a delay in the development of our product candidates 
further  in order to maintain our development time lines in the event of a change in our third party contract manufacturer  we may incur significantly higher costs to manufacture our product candidates 

table of contents our product candidates may exhibit undesirable side effects when used alone or in interaction with other approved pharmaceutical products  which may delay or preclude their further development or regulatory approval  or limit their use if approved 
throughout the drug development process  we must continually demonstrate the safety of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval to advance their clinical development or to market them 
even if our product candidates demonstrate biologic activity and clinical efficacy  any unacceptable adverse side effects or toxicities  when administered alone or in the presence of other pharmaceutical products  which can arise at any stage of development  may outweigh their potential benefit 
in preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date  our product candidates have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and no unacceptable drug drug interactions  although these studies and trials have involved a small number of subjects or patients over a limited period of time 
we may observe adverse or significant adverse events or drug drug interactions in future preclinical studies or clinical trials of these product candidates  which could result in the delay or termination of their development  prevent regulatory approval  or limit their market acceptance if they are ultimately approved 
the safety or efficacy profile of inx may differ in combination with other existing or future drugs used to treat chronic hepatitis c  and therefore may preclude its further development or approval  which could materially harm or business 
it is anticipated that in the future  the optimized treatment of chronic hepatitis c will involve the combination of three or more antiviral compounds 
accordingly  phase ii and phase iii clinical trials of other direct acting antiviral agents similar to inx are now being conducted in combination with the current standard of care and increasingly  with other direct acting antivirals in clinical development 
therefore  the clinical development and commercialization pathway for inx  or any other product candidate we may develop in the future for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  will require that it be evaluated in clinical trials in combination with other existing or future antivirals 
even if inx demonstrates meaningful therapeutic benefits equal to or better than our competitor s compounds  an acceptable safety profile  and a dose amenable to combination therapy in phase i and other early stage clinical trials  inx when combined with other hcv therapies  it may demonstrate unexpected side effects 
we cannot assure you that inx will be amenable for use in combination with some  or any  existing therapies or those in clinical development 
further  to evaluate inx in combination therapy with other antivirals may require us to establish collaborations  licensing arrangements or alliances with third parties in the future 
there is no assurance we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully or develop innovative products  which could harm our business 
our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
key competitive factors in our industry include  among others  the ability to successfully advance the development of a product candidate through preclinical and clinical trials  the efficacy  toxicological  safety  resistance or cross resistance  and dosing profile of a product or product candidate  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  if ever achieved  reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of competing products and pharmaceutical products in general  the availability of raw materials and qualified contract manufacturing and manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
if ultimately approved  fv  inx  or any product candidate from our current or future development programs would compete against existing therapies or other product candidates in various stages of clinical development that we believe may potentially become available in the future for the treatment of shingles  chronic hepatitis c and the prevention of staphylococcal infections 
some of the large pharmaceutical companies that currently market products that would compete with our product candidates  if approved  include  but are not limited to glaxosmithkline  novartis and merck in the shingles market and merck and roche in the hepatitis c market 
in addition to existing therapies  there are many other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies developing numerous direct acting antiviral product candidates across various classes of compounds for the 
table of contents treatment of chronic hepatitis c  including  but not limited to  abbott  anadys pharmaceuticals  bristol myers squibb  gilead  idenix pharmaceuticals  johnson and johnson  merck  novartis  pfizer  pharmasset  roche  and vertex  which may compete with inx or any other hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitor we may develop in the future 
most of the product candidates being developed by these companies  and in particular those that belong to the class of compounds referred to as protease inhibitors  are further advanced in their clinical development than inx further  idenix pharmaceuticals and pharmasset are developing nucleotide analogues  which are similar to the approach we are using for inx moreover  their compounds have advanced further in clinical development and are currently in phase ii clinical trials 
while there are many direct acting antivirals in various stages of clinical development  none has yet to be approved for sale by the fda or emea 
accordingly  the competitive landscape for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c is expected to be highly dynamic over the next five to ten years 
in order to compete effectively in this market in the future  we believe a direct acting antiviral will need to demonstrate a favorable toxicity profile  superior potency  high resistance barriers  and be amenable to combination with other direct acting antivirals in a low fixed oral dose 
developing pharmaceutical product candidates is a highly competitive  expensive and risky activity with a long business cycle 
many organizations  including the large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies that have existing products on the market or in clinical development that would compete with fv or inx  have substantially more capital resources than we have  and much greater capabilities and experience than we have in research and discovery  designing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  operating in a highly regulated environment  manufacturing drug substances and drug products  and marketing and sales 
our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates and achieving broad market acceptance once they are approved 
our competitors drugs or product candidates may be more effective  have fewer negative side effects  be more convenient to administer  have a more favorable drug resistance profile  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we  or our potential collaborators  may commercialize 
new drugs  or classes of drugs from competitors  may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we are able to successfully develop them or  if approved  before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing them 
we anticipate that we or our collaborators will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and drug classes enter the market and advanced technologies or new drug targets become available 
if our product candidates do not demonstrate any competitive advantages over existing drugs  new drugs or product candidates  we or our future collaborators may terminate the development or commercialization of our product candidates at any time in the future 
we anticipate that our product candidates  and in particular fv if successfully developed and approved  will compete directly or indirectly with existing generic drugs  or drugs that will be generic by the time our product candidates might be approved for sale 
generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by intellectually property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication will generally impose significant pricing pressure on competing drugs 
we also face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and for attracting investigators and clinical sites capable of conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are safer  more effective  less expensive or easier to administer than ours 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we can 
companies that can complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commercialize their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that could delay the ability of competitors to market certain products 
we cannot assure you that product candidates resulting from our research and development efforts  or from joint efforts with our collaborators  will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development 

table of contents we do not have significant internal drug discovery capabilities  and therefore we are primarily dependent on in licensing or acquiring development programs from third parties in order to obtain additional product candidates 
while we are currently focused on developing our existing product candidates  if we sought to expand our pipeline  we would be largely dependent on in licensing or acquiring product candidates as we do not have significant internal discovery capabilities at this time 
accordingly  in order to generate and expand our development pipeline  we have relied  and will continue to rely  on obtaining discoveries  new technologies  intellectual property and product candidates from third parties through sponsored research  in licensing arrangements or acquisitions 
we may face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  many of which may have greater resources then we have  in obtaining these in licensing  sponsored research or acquisition opportunities 
additional in licensing or acquisition opportunities may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable  if at all 
in licensed compounds that appear promising in discovery  or research or preclinical studies may fail to progress into further preclinical studies or clinical trials at all 
our research and development efforts may not lead to the discovery of any additional product candidates that would be suitable for further preclinical or clinical development 
the discovery of additional product candidates requires significant time  as well as a substantial commitment of personnel and financial resources 
three is a great deal of uncertainty inherent in our research efforts and as a consequence  our ability to expand our development pipeline with additional product candidates may not be successful 
if a product liability claim is brought against us  our ability to assert a federal preemption defense may be limited 
in the recent case of wyeth v 
levine  decided on march   the us supreme court rejected a pharmaceutical company s argument that certain failure to warn claims alleging deficiencies in its labeling were preempted by federal law because the fda approved the labels 
although the court s decision was limited to the facts of that case  if any of our products are approved for sale by the fda and commercialized  this decision may limit our ability to assert a federal preemption defense in any product liability suit which may be brought in the future against such product 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities  or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards that could materially harm our business 
the use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved pharmaceutical products may expose us to significant product liability claims 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of million 
in the event any of our product candidates are approved for sale by the fda and commercialized  we may need to increase the amount of our product liability coverage 
such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a product liability claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant financial loss 
our research activities involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and medical waste 
notwithstanding the regulations controlling the use and disposal of these materials as well as the safety procedures we undertake  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge or exposure  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents risks relating to the commercialization of our product candidates we may delay or terminate the development of a product candidate at any time if we believe the perceived market or commercial opportunity does not justify further investment  which could materially harm our business 
even though the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials that we have conducted or may conduct in the future may support further development of one or more of our product candidates  we may delay  suspend or terminate the future development of a product candidate at any time for strategic  business  financial or other reasons  including the determination or belief that the emerging profile of the product candidate is such that it may not receive fda approval  nor gain meaningful acceptance  generate a significant return to shareholders  or otherwise provide any competitive advantages in its intended indication or market 
if the actual or perceived therapeutic benefits of fv are not sufficiently different from existing generic drugs currently used to treat shingles  we may terminate the development of fv at any time  or our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of fv  if approved  may be limited and our potential profitability could be harmed 
valacyclovir  famciclovir and acyclovir are existing generic drugs currently used to treat shingles patients 
generic drugs are compounds that have no remaining patent protection  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by patents and intellectual property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from a generic drug treating the same condition or disease in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication may impose significant pricing pressure on patented drugs 
accordingly  if at any time we believe that fv may not provide meaningful therapeutic benefits  perceived or real  over these existing generic drugs  we may terminate or delay its future development 
we cannot provide any assurance that the ongoing phase ii trial or later stage clinical trials of fv will demonstrate any meaningful therapeutic benefits over existing generic drugs sufficient to justify its continued development 
further  if we successfully develop fv and it is approved for sale  we cannot assure you that any real or perceived therapeutic benefits of fv over generic drugs will result in a price higher than the existing generic drugs 
if the actual or perceived therapeutic benefits or the safety profile of inx are not equal to or better than other direct anti viral treatments in clinical development  or if the dosing of inx is not amenable to combination with other existing or future anti viral therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  we may terminate the development of inx at any time  or our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of inx  if approved  may be limited and our potential profitability could be harmed 
we are aware of a number of companies developing various classes of direct acting antiviral product candidates for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  some of which are of a similar class to inx since many of these product candidates are further advanced in clinical development than inx  their time to approval and commercialization timelines may be sooner than those for inx accordingly  if at any time we believe that inx may not provide meaningful therapeutic benefits  perceived or real  equal to or better than our competitor s compounds  or we believe that inx may not have as favorable a safety profile as potentially competitive compounds  or we believe inx may not be amendable for use in a combination therapy with existing or future treatments for chronic hepatitis c  we may delay or terminate the future development of inx at any time 
we cannot provide any assurance that future preclinical studies or clinical trials of inx will demonstrate any meaningful therapeutic benefits over potentially competitive compounds in development  an acceptable safety profile sufficient to justify its continued development  or whether inx is amenable to combination therapy 

table of contents if we fail to enter into collaborations or other sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates  or otherwise fail to establish marketing and sales capabilities  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we currently have no infrastructure to support the commercialization of any of our product candidates  and have little  if any  experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  if our product candidates are ultimately approved for sale  our future profitability will depend largely on our ability to access or develop suitable marketing and sales capabilities 
we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with other companies  through license and collaborations agreements  to commercialize our product candidates in north america and in other countries around the world 
to the extent that we enter into these license and collaboration agreements  or marketing and sales arrangements with other companies to sell  promote or market our products in the us or abroad  our product revenues  which may be in the form of indirect revenue  a royalty  or a split of profits  will depend largely on their efforts  which may not be successful 
the development of a sales force and marketing capabilities may result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate significant revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified third parties or marketing or sales personnel  or be able to establish marketing capabilities or an effective sales force 
if government and third party payers fail to provide adequate reimbursement or coverage for our products or those we develop through collaborations  our revenues and potential for profitability will be harmed 
in the us and most foreign markets  our product revenues  and therefore the inherent value of our product candidates  will depend largely upon the reimbursement rates established by third party payers for such product candidates or products 
such third party payers include government health administration authorities  managed care organizations  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products  services and pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status  if any  of newly approved drugs or pharmaceutical products 
further  the comparative effectiveness of new compounds over existing therapies and the assessment of other non clinical outcomes are increasingly being considered in the decision by these payers to establish reimbursement rates 
we may also need to conduct post marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products 
such studies may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that any products we successfully develop will be reimbursed in part  or at all  by any third party payers in any countries 
domestic and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to expand the coverage  yet reduce the cost of healthcare including pharmaceutical drugs 
in some foreign markets  governments control prescription drugs pricing and profitability 
in the us  significant changes in federal health care policy have been approved 
some of the legislation could result in reduced reimbursement rates 
we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement more governmental control over reimbursement rates of pharmaceutical products 
in addition  we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care and government intervention in the us healthcare system will continue to put downward pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products domestically 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our product candidates in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products may change before our product candidates are approved for sale  which could further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for our product candidates 
further  pressure from social activist groups  whose goal it is to reduce the cost of drugs  particularly in less developed nations  also may put downward pressure on the price of drugs  which could result in downward pressure on the prices of our products in the absence of generic competition 
if any product candidates that we develop independently or through collaborations are approved but do not gain meaningful acceptance in their intended markets  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and we or a collaborator obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize them in the future  they may not gain market acceptance or utilization 
table of contents among physicians  patients or third party payers 
the degree of market acceptance that any of our product candidates may achieve will depend on a number of factors  including the therapeutic efficacy or perceived benefit of the product relative to existing therapies  if they exist  the timing of market approval and existing marketed competitive drugs  the level of reimbursement provided by payers to cover the cost of the product  the cost of the product to the user or payer  the convenience and ease of administration of our products  the product s potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  the actual or perceived existence  prevalence and severity of side effects  the effectiveness of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the scope of the product label approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that physicians will choose to prescribe or administer our products  if approved  to the intended patient population 
if our products do not achieve meaningful market acceptance  or if the market for our products proves to be smaller than anticipated  we may not generate significant revenues or ever become profitable 
even if we or a collaborator achieve market acceptance for our products  we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to generic competition or social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs  which would reduce our revenue and future profitability 
many approved products are already available in generic form in certain markets and indications that we are developing our product candidates for  particularly for the treatment of shingles 
if fv is successfully developed and approved  we expect to face competition from these generic drugs  including significant price based competition 
further  pressure from social activist groups  whose goal it is to reduce the cost of drugs  particularly in less developed nations  also may put downward pressure on the price of drugs  which could result in downward pressure on the prices of our products in the absence of generic competition 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators and us  our collaborators may act in their best interest and not in ours  which could delay or terminate the development of a product candidate and adversely affect our business 
conflicts may arise with our existing or future collaborators if they pursue alternative therapies for the same diseases or indications that are targeted by compounds or intellectual property rights we have licensed to them 
potentially competing products developed by our existing or future collaborators may result in development delays or the withdrawal of their support for our product candidates 
additionally  conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the progress of  or other activities related to  the clinical development of a product candidate  the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of the collaborative arrangement 
similarly  we may disagree with a collaborator as to which party owns newly or jointly developed intellectual property 
should an agreement be revised or terminated as a result of a dispute and before we have realized the anticipated benefits of the collaboration  we may not be able to obtain certain development support or revenues that we anticipated receiving 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully develop a product candidate that is the subject of collaboration if our collaborator does not perform  terminates our agreement  or delays the development of our product candidate 
we expect to continue to enter into and rely on license and collaboration agreements or other business arrangements with third parties to further develop and or commercialize our existing and future product candidates 
such collaborators or partners may not perform as agreed upon or anticipated  fail to comply with strict regulations  or elect to delay or terminate their efforts in developing or commercializing our product candidates even though we have performed our obligations under the arrangement 
for example  if an existing or future collaborator does not devote sufficient time and resources to our collaboration arrangement  we may not realize the full potential benefits of the arrangement  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
a majority of the potential revenue from existing and future collaborations will likely consist of contingent payments  such as payments for achieving development or regulatory milestones and royalties payable on the sales of approved products 
the milestone and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend primarily upon our collaborator s ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under our existing or future collaborations using our technologies  which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive  if any 
in many cases  we will not be directly involved in the development or commercialization of our product candidates and accordingly  will depend entirely on our collaborators 
our collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates because they do not allocate the necessary resources due to internal constraints  such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise  limited capital resources  or the belief that other product candidates or programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment  do not have sufficient resources necessary to fully support the product candidate through clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization  are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  or re evaluate the importance and their support for developing our product candidate in light of a revised pipeline  business or financial strategy 
in addition  a collaborator may decide to pursue the development of a competitive product candidate developed outside of our collaboration with them 
if a collaboration partner fails to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates for any of these reasons  we may not be able to replace them with another partner willing to develop and commercialize our product candidates under similar terms  if at all 
we may also be unable to obtain  on terms acceptable to us  a license from such collaboration partner to any of its intellectual property that may be necessary or useful for us to continue to develop and commercialize the product candidate 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will emerge from our relationships with pfizer or any other future collaboration agreements we may enter into for any of our product candidates 
if we are unable to adequately protect or expand our intellectual property related to our current or future product candidates  our business prospects could be harmed 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights or patents 
we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies involves 
table of contents complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights 
therefore  any issued patents that we own or otherwise have intellectual property rights to may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and may not provide us with the protection against competitors that we anticipate 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary intellectual property rights is uncertain because issued patents and other legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
our future patent position will be influenced by the following factors we or our licensors may not have been the first to discover the inventions covered by each of our  or our licensors  pending patent applications and issued patents  and we may have to engage in expensive and protracted interference proceedings to determine priority of invention  our or our licensors pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  our or our licensors issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products  may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties  and third parties may develop intellectual property around our or our licensors patent claims to design competitive intellectual property and ultimately product candidates that fall outside the scope of our or our licensors patents 
because of the extensive time required for the development  testing and regulatory review and approval of a product candidate  it is possible that before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire  or such patent rights may remain in force for only a short period following approval and commercialization 
patent expiration could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
also  patent rights may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights 
for example  we may not be able to prevent a third party from infringing our patents in a country that does not recognize or enforce patent rights  or that imposes compulsory licenses on or restricts the prices of life saving drugs 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the us and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we or our licensors do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the products or technologies we own or have licensed 
in addition  we may not have total control over the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others 
accordingly  we may be unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any pending or issued patents we own or license  and rights we receive under those issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection that will be afforded by any of our issued or pending patents  or those licensed by us 
if a third party claims we are infringing on its intellectual property rights  we could incur significant expenses  or be prevented from further developing or commercializing our product candidates 
our success will largely depend on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties 
this is generally referred to as having the freedom to operate 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims  us patent and trademark office uspt interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings  both in the us and internationally  involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are lengthy  costly and time consuming and their outcome is highly uncertain 
we may become involved in protracted and expensive litigation in order to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the 
table of contents proprietary rights of others  or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others 
patent applications in the us are  in most cases  maintained in secrecy until approximately months after the patent application is filed 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
therefore  patent applications relating to products similar to our product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge 
in the event that a third party has also filed a patent application covering our product candidate or other claims  we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding  known as an interference proceeding in the uspt office  or similar proceedings in other countries to determine the priority of invention 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim  we may be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of a product candidate and may be subject to injunctions and or damage awards 
we are aware of other companies having filed patent applications attempting to cover broad classes of compounds to treat chronic hepatitis c in the us and other countries 
in the future  the uspt or a foreign patent office may grant patent rights to our product candidates or other claims to third parties 
subject to the issuance of these future patents  the claims of which will be unknown until issued  we may need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to further develop or commercialize them 
any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we need to obtain such licenses or sublicenses  but are unable to do so  we could encounter delays in the development of our product candidates  or be prevented from developing  manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates at all 
if it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate  we could be subject to injunctions  and or compelled to pay significant damages  including punitive damages 
in cases where we have in licensed intellectual property  our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements could harm our business 
it is becoming common for third parties to challenge patent claims on any successful product candidate or approved drug 
if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other legal proceedings  we could incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
a negative outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe patent protection is obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners  employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property  and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party 
enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us may be less willing to protect trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 

table of contents risks related to owning our common stock we have experienced operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable 
since inception may  and through december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs related to supporting our research programs and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  and general and administrative costs relating to supporting our operations 
we anticipate incurring losses from operations for the foreseeable future  as we continue to conduct significant laboratory and preclinical testing and conduct extensive and expensive clinical trials for our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate direct or royalty revenue from the sale of products  or ever become profitable 
our revenues  expenses and results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations  which will make it difficult to compare our operating results from period to period 
until we  or a collaborator  have successfully developed one of our product candidates  we expect that substantially all of our revenue will result from payments we receive under collaborative arrangements or license agreements where we grant others the right to use our intellectual property or know how 
we may not be able to generate additional revenues under existing or future collaborative agreements 
furthermore  payments potentially due to us under our existing and any future collaborative arrangements  including any milestone and up front payments  are intermittent in nature and are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount  or may never be earned or paid 
further  our existing collaboration arrangement allows our partner to terminate the agreement on relatively short notice 
based on our current strategy  our quarterly and annual operating costs and revenues may become highly volatile  and comparisons to previous periods will be difficult to make 
therefore  our historical and current revenues may not be indicative of our ability to achieve additional payment generating milestones or events in the future 
we expect that our operating results will also vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the initiation  success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials  the timing of the formulation and manufacture of our product candidates  or other development related factors 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues or results of operations for any other period 
the reporting requirements of being a publicly traded company increase our overall operating costs and subject us to increased regulatory risk 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act and the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market llc 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  which is expensive and requires the attention of our limited management resources 
further effective as of the fiscal year of and onward  our independent auditor will attest on our internal control over financial reporting 
the various financial reporting  legal  corporate governance and other obligations associated with being a publicly traded company require us to incur significant expenditures and place additional demands on our board of directors and management  as well as administrative  operational  and financial resources 
if we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely and effective manner  we and or our executive officers may be subject to sanctions by the sec  and our ability to raise additional funds in the future maybe impaired and ultimately affects our business 
we will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company 

table of contents in order to develop our product candidates and support our operations beyond months  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital 
such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could materially harm our business and business prospects  and the price of our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand as of the date of this filing  together with proceeds we expect to receive from our existing license and collaboration agreement will enable us to operate through we have no other committed sources of additional capital at this time 
this guidance assumes that we completes our ongoing phase ii proof of concept trial of fv in and initiate a phase i clinical trial of inx in the first half of this estimate does not include the direct costs associated with continuing the clinical development of fv or inx beyond these ongoing or planned clinical trials  or the impact of any other significant transaction or change in strategy or development plans in the future 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us at all  or on terms that we find acceptable  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate research and development efforts on any or all of our product candidates 
we may also be forced to curtail  restructure  sell  or merge our operations  or obtain funds by entering into arrangements with licensees  collaborators or partners on unattractive terms  or sell or relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or our intellectual property that we would not otherwise sell or relinquish in order to continue operations or the development of our product candidates  assuming any such arrangements are available at all 
the timing and extent of our future financing needs will depend on many factors  some of which are very difficult to predict and others that may be beyond our control  including our development plans for our product candidates  including any changes in our strategy  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials  the rate of enrollment in such clinical trials and the results of these clinical trials the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting preclinical studies  the cost of formulating and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials to evaluate our product candidates  receiving fda approval to advance the clinical development of our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all the cost to obtain regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our product candidates the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  future payments we may receive or make under existing or future license or collaboration agreements  if any  the cost to maintain a corporate infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims 
the price of our common stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment in us could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile since the completion of our initial public offering in june the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including but not limited to our ability to successfully advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development  disclosure of any favorable or unfavorable data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials  or other regulatory developments concerning our clinical trials  the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  or those of our competitors  
table of contents our ability to manage our cash burn rate at an acceptable or planned level  the approval or commercialization of new products by us or our competitors  and the disclosure thereof  announcements of scientific innovations by us or our competitors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  public concern about the safety of our product candidates  or similar classes of compounds  litigation to which we may become subject  actual or anticipated variations in our annual and quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in drug reimbursement rates or government policies related to such reimbursement  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  new regulatory legislation adopted in the us or abroad  changes in patent legislation in the us or abroad our failure to achieve or meet equity research analysts expectations or their estimates of our business or prospects  or a change in their recommendations concerning us  the value of our common stock or our industry in general  termination or delay in any of our existing or future collaborative arrangements  future sales of equity or debt securities  or the perception that such future sales may occur  the sale of shares held by our directors or management  the loss of our eligibility to have shares of our common stock traded on the nasdaq capital market due to our failure to maintain minimum listing standards  changes in accounting principles  failure to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of publicly owned companies under the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of  and general economic conditions and capital markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and more specifically the nasdaq capital market  upon which our common stock trades  and the market for smaller biotechnology stocks in particular have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
volatility in the market price for a particular biotechnology company s stock has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of that company 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
due to this volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid  which could generate losses 
future issuances of shares of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline  even if our business is doing well 
the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such future sales could occur  particularly with respect to sales by our directors  executive officers  and other insiders or their affiliates  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 

table of contents if we raise additional capital in the future  your ownership in us could be diluted 
any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive 
if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common stockholder  which could impair the value of our common stock 
insiders and affiliates continue to have substantial control over us  which could delay or prevent a change in control 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may have the ability to delay or prevent a change in control that may be favored by other stockholders and otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including the appointment of directors  the appointment  change or termination of management  any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  the approval of acquisitions or mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
a significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants  which upon such exercise could result in dilution to our security holders 
as of december   there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  which warrants had a weighted average exercise price of 
the exercise price and or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations  including upon the occurrence of certain reclassifications or mergers or certain subdivisions or combinations of the common stock  and the issuance of certain stock dividends 
although we cannot determine at this time which of these warrants may ultimately be exercised  it is reasonable to assume that a warrant may be exercised if the exercise price thereof is below the market price of our common stock at the time of exercise 
to the extent any of our outstanding warrants are exercised in the future  additional shares of our common stock will be issued that will be eligible for resale in the public market  which could result in dilution to our security holders 
the issuance of additional securities upon the exercise of warrants could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends  and accordingly  stockholders must rely on appreciation in the price of our common stock for any return on their investment in us 
we anticipate that we will retain our earnings  if any  for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
as a result  only appreciation in the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders 

table of contents our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws  as well as delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware  the state in which we are incorporated  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions establish a classified  or staggered  board of directors so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time  set limitations on the removal of directors  limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and provide our board of directors with the ability to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to remove and elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item properties we lease our  square foot office and laboratory facility  which is located in alpharetta  georgia  a northern suburb of atlanta 
we entered into this lease in december and occupied this facility during the second quarter of our minimum lease obligations for this facility will approximate to million per annum for the lease term of ten years 
we believe that our facility is adequate for our current business as a conducted  as well as our expected business for the foreseeable future 
we have entered into sublease agreements for portions of this facility and are seeking additional sublease agreements for other portions of our facility that are currently unused

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains assumptions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors  special note on forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated anti infective products to prevent or treat serious infections 
our research and development efforts are currently focused on small molecule antiviral compounds  and in particular  orally available therapies to treat herpes zoster  also referred to as shingles and chronic infections caused by hepatitis c virus hcv 
currently available antiviral therapies have a number of therapeutic limitations that include inadequate potency  adverse side effects  complex dosing schedules  inconvenient methods of administration  and diminishing efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistant viruses 
we believe that our antiviral product candidates have the potential to address a number of these limitations as well as unmet clinical needs in their respective intended indications 
in addition to our antiviral programs  we have also licensed the rights to certain intellectual property from our 
table of contents mscramm protein platform to pfizer for the development of active vaccines to prevent staphylococcal infections 
we have neither received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore  it is possible that we may never successfully derive significant product revenues from any of our existing or future preclinical development programs or product candidates 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  our operations will result in a net loss on a quarterly and yearly basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have generated revenues from the licensing of our products  but do not expect substantial product related revenues until we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates 
our revenues primarily represent the amortization of up front license fees and periodic research and development support payments we have received in connection with license and collaboration agreements 
if our or any of our existing or future collaborators development efforts result in regulatory approval and the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  we expect the majority of our future revenues would then result from upfront license fees  milestone payments  royalties  or other product revenue agreements 
in  we expect our revenues will slightly increase from due to a milestone payment from pfizer  inc formerly  wyeth in connection with our collaboration agreement with them 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of the costs incurred to license  develop  test and manufacture our product candidates 
these costs consist primarily of preclinical studies and supplies associated with development activities by internal staff  research chemistry  professional fees paid to third party service providers in connection with conducting preclinical studies and treating patients enrolled in our clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related data  salaries and personnel related expenses for our internal staff  including benefits and share based compensation  the cost to formulate and manufacture product candidates  legal fees associated with patents and intellectual property  consulting fees  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  depreciation and laboratory facility costs 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expense for the years ended december  and direct external costs represent expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to product candidates in preclinical or clinical development  such as the costs to acquire and maintain licensed programs  payments to third parties for toxicological studies  contract research organizations that monitor  accumulate and analyze data from our clinical trials  investigators who treat the patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the cost of chemistry  consulting fees  formulation and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
all remaining research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel related expenses  legal fees associated with patents and intellectual property  supplies  depreciation  facility costs and other overhead expense  are not tracked to a specific product development program and are included in unallocated costs and overhead 
research and development spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
years ended december  in millions direct external costs fv hcv other preclinical programs unallocated costs and overhead total research and development expenses 
table of contents we anticipate that our research and development expense will increase in  as compared to  due to our clinical development plans for fv and inx due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and regulatory approval of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the results of these trials and studies 
from time to time  we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to these programs in response to their scientific  clinical and regulatory success  anticipated market opportunity and the availability of capital to fund our programs 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of our existing or future product candidates  if at all  and some of the possible consequences of failing to do so  is set forth in the risk factors section of this form k 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense reflects the costs incurred to manage and support our research and development activities and corporate infrastructure 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resources functions 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal  auditing  market research and other consulting services  as well as premiums for insurance  other expenses a result of being publicly traded  and depreciation and facility expenses 
in  we expect our general and administrative expense to remain relatively consistent with our expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and notes payable 
other income and expense has historically consisted of the proceeds from the gain or loss on the disposal of equipment and foreign currency adjustments 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our current financial condition and historical results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important in understanding our financial statements and operating results 
historically our estimates for our critical accounting policies have been not been materially inaccurate 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under licensing and other collaborative research and development agreements as we perform services or accomplish contractual obligations 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements in which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the term of our ongoing obligations under the agreement 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative arrangements are recognized as the research and development activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
in the event we receive milestone payments  we will recognize such payments as earned when all of the conditions of such milestone are achieved 
accrued expenses 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to estimate expenses that we believe have been incurred but for which we have not yet received invoices from our vendors  or for employee services that have not been paid 
this process primarily involves identifying services and activities that have 
table of contents been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of significant expenses for which we generally accrue based on estimates include fees for services  such as those provided by certain clinical research and data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with the conduct of our clinical trials  certain research organizations that perform preclinical studies  and fees owed to certain contract manufacturers in connection with the formulation or manufacture of materials for our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in order to estimate costs incurred to date  but for which we have not been invoiced  we analyze the progress and related activities  the terms of the underlying contract or agreement  any invoices received and the budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   we adopted the amended guidance for the fair value measurement of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent 
this amendment permits us to measure the fair value of certain investments  including those with fair values that are not readily determinable  on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment or its equivalent if such net asset value is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles as of our measurement date 
this amendment also requires enhanced disclosures about the nature and risks of investments within its scope that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  financial accounting standards board fasb amended the guidance for revenue recognition in multiple element arrangements 
the guidance will require an entity to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  and allocates revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price 
the guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
this amendment is effective for us beginning january  and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting amendment on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal years ended december  and summary 
for  we reported a net loss of million  as compared to a net loss of million in and basic and diluted net loss per share of in as compared to in the increase in net loss and net loss per share  as compared to  was principally due to higher research and development expense associated with the clinical development of fv and the preclinical development of inx and the company s hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitor program  lower revenues from a collaborative license and development agreement and lower net interest income and other income  offset in part by a reduction in general and administrative expense 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to support the clinical development of fv  inx and the preclinical development of other hcv nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was primarily the result of upfront license fees received by the company in and being fully amortized to revenue as of the end of  and to a lesser extent  lower periodic research associated support fees received by the company in

interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased to million for from million in the decrease of million was largely the result of a decrease in net interest income in primarily due to lower interest rates in than liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception in may through december   we have funded our operations primarily with million in gross proceeds raised from a series of five private equity financings  our ipo in june  and three private investment in public equity financings pipe 

table of contents from inception through december   we have also borrowed a total of million under various notes payable  a credit facility with a commercial bank and capital leases  and have received approximately million in license fees  collaborative research payments and grants  of which million and million were recorded as deferred revenue as of december  and december   respectively 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and we held no investments with an average maturity greater than months 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are generally held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  commercial paper  corporate debt and money market accounts that have an average maturity date of less than months 
cash flows for the year ended december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased by million  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of million  offset by net cash used for operating activities and to a lesser extent  the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable 
net cash used for operating activities was million in  which reflects our net loss for the period of million  offset in part by a net increase in operating liabilities over operating assets of million and non cash charges of million 
our net loss resulted largely from the cost of funding our clinical trials  preclinical studies  other research and development activities  and general and administrative expenses  offset in part by the amortization of deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements and net interest income 
the net increase in operating liabilities over operating assets reflects a million increase in accrued expenses and a million increase in accounts payable  offset in part by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash used for investing activities was million  which primarily consisted of net proceeds from short term investments of million and million in proceeds from sale of equipment  offset in part by million in cash paid for capital expenditures 
net cash from financing activities was million  which consisted of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants during  offset by million in scheduled payments on our capital leases and notes payable 
funding requirements our future funding requirements are difficult to determine and will depend on a number of factors  including our development plans for our product candidates  including any changes in our strategy  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials  the rate of enrollment in such clinical trials and the results of these clinical trials the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting preclinical studies  the cost of formulating and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials to evaluate our product candidates  receiving regulatory approval to advance the clinical development of our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all  the cost to obtain regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our product candidates  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  future payments we may receive or make under existing or future license or collaboration agreements  if any  
table of contents the cost to maintain a corporate infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims 
based on our current strategy and operating plan  and considering the potential costs associated with advancing the development of our product candidates on our planned timelines  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december   including anticipated proceeds from our existing license and collaboration agreements  will enable us to operate for a period of at approximately months 
our estimate assumes that we complete the ongoing phase ii proof of concept trial of fv and initiate a phase i clinical trial of inx in the first half of this estimate does not include the direct costs associated with continuing the clinical development of fv or inx beyond these ongoing or planned clinical trials  or the impact of any other significant transaction or change in strategy or development plans in the future 
we currently do not have any commitments for future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate significant revenue from the sale of any products in the foreseeable future 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months to continue the development of our product candidates  or possibly sooner in the event we enter into other transactions or change our strategy or development plans  we may need to secure additional capital 
we would expect to do so primarily through the sale of additional common stock or other equity securities  as well as through proceeds from licensing agreements  strategic collaborations  forms of debt financing  or any other financing vehicle 
funds from these sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our future business strategy  plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available to us in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or delay or curtail our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
if additional capital is not available to us  we may need to obtain funds through license agreements  collaborative or partner arrangements pursuant to which we will likely relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently  or be forced to enter into such arrangements earlier than we would prefer  which would likely result in less favorable transaction terms 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business
