item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an externally managed mortgage reit incorporated in maryland in september to invest in adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate single family residential mortgage pass through securities guaranteed or issued by a us government agency such as ginnie mae  or by a us government sponsored entity such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
our principal goal is to generate net income for distribution to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and protect and grow our shareholders equity which we also refer to as our book value through prudent interest rate risk management 
our net income is determined primarily by the difference between the interest income we earn on our agency securities net of premium or discount amortization and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities  which we also refer to as our net interest spread or net interest margin 
we utilize substantial borrowings in financing our investment portfolio  which can enhance potential returns but exacerbate losses 
in general  our book value is most affected by our issuance of shares of our common stock  our retained earnings or losses  and changes in the value of our investment portfolio or our hedging instruments 
we began operations in november with a private equity offering and raised additional equity three times in accordingly  all of our financial results and data should be viewed with the knowledge that this was a period of significant growth for our company  and that period to period comparisons may not be meaningful or may produce comparisons that may be misleading to future activity and results 
in november  we completed our initial private offering of  shares of our common stock for per share and commenced operations 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from our initial private offering after offering expenses 
we completed three offerings of our common stock in in february  we completed a second private offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for per share 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from our second private offering after offering expenses 
in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
in december we completed an additional public offering of our common stock 
we sold a total of  shares at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december  and  our mortgage backed security mbs portfolio consisted of approximately billion and billion  respectively  in market value  of agency securities with initial fixed interest rate periods of three years  five years  seven years or years 
the following table represents key data regarding our company since the beginning of operations on november  in thousands except per share amounts as of agency securities repurchase agreements equity shares outstanding book value per share quarterly diluted earnings per share december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  
table of contents factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
we invest in financial assets and markets  and recent events  such as discussed below  can affect our business in ways that are difficult to predict  and produce results outside of typical operating variances 
our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  government actions  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment rates on our agency securities purchased at a premium increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such assets will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
with the maturities of our assets generally of longer term than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our assets and therefore our book value 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
prepayments on agency securities and the underlying mortgage loans may be influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control  and consequently such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
to the extent we have acquired agency securities at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our agency securities will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income may suffer 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage markets significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we intend to use hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not intend to hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our portfolio 
in addition  a variety of other factors relating to our business may also impact our financial condition and operating performance 
these factors include our degree of leverage  our access to funding and borrowing capacity  our hedging activities  and the reit requirements  the requirements to qualify for an exemption under the investment company act and other regulatory and accounting policies related to our business 
our manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our equity as defined in our management agreement  regardless of the performance of our portfolio 
accordingly  the payment of our management fee may not decline in the event of a decline in our profitability and may cause us to incur losses 

table of contents for a discussion of additional risks relating to our business see risk factors 
market and interest rate trends and the effect on our portfolio credit market disruption during the past two to three years  the residential housing and mortgage markets in the united states have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions including loan defaults  credit losses and decreased liquidity 
these conditions have resulted in volatility in the value of the agency securities in our portfolio and an increase in the average collateral requirements under our repurchase agreements 
liquidating sales by several large institutions have increased the volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality rmbs 
as a result  values for rmbs  including some agency securities  have been negatively impacted 
further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the agency securities in which we invest 
in addition  we rely on the availability of financing to acquire agency securities on a leveraged basis 
as values for certain types of agency securities declined many lenders in the agency securities market tightened their lending standards  and in some cases  withdrew financing of residential mortgage assets and agency securities 
our lenders may have owned or financed rmbs that have declined in value and caused them to incur losses 
if these market conditions persist  our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital or haircut required to obtain financing  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
developments at fannie mae and freddie mac payments on the agency securities in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
because of the guarantee and the underwriting standards associated with mortgages underlying agency securities  agency securities historically have had high stability in value and been considered to present low credit risk 
in  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed under the conservatorship of the us government due to the significant weakness of their financial condition 
the turmoil in the residential mortgage sector and concern over the future role of fannie mae and freddie mac have generally increased credit spreads and decreased price stability of agency securities 
in response to the credit market disruption and the deteriorating financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac  congress and the us treasury undertook a series of actions in aimed at stabilizing the financial markets in general  and the mortgage market in particular 
these actions include the large scale buying of mortgage backed securities  significant equity infusions into banks and aggressive monetary policy 
in february  fannie mae and freddie mac announced that they will be purchasing delinquent loans from mortgage pools guaranteed by them 
delinquent loans for this program will be those that are days or greater delinquent as of measurement date 
freddie mac stated that it will be consummating all of its purchases at once  based on the delinquencies as of february  with payments to securities holders on march th and april th 
as of this report  fannie mae has not released as many details about its program other than to say that their purchases will occur over several months 
these actions could decrease our income and book value 
we cannot predict whether or when new actions may occur  the timing and pace of current actions already implemented  or what impact if any  such actions  or future actions  could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
interest rates the overall credit market deterioration since august has also affected prevailing interest rates 
for example  interest rates have been unusually volatile since the third quarter of since september   the us federal reserve has lowered the target for the federal funds rate nine times from to in october in december  the federal reserve stated that it was adopting a policy of quantitative easing and would target keeping the federal funds rate between and 
the company s funding costs  which traditionally have tracked day libor have generally benefited by this easing of monetary policy  although to a 
table of contents somewhat lesser extent 
because of continued uncertainty in the credit markets and us economic conditions  we expect that interest rates are likely to experience continued volatility  which will likely affect our financial results since our cost of funds is largely dependent on short term rates 
historically  the day libor has closely tracked movements in the federal funds rate 
our borrowings in the repurchase market have also historically closely tracked libor 
so traditionally  a lower federal funds rate has indicated a time of increased net interest margin and higher asset values 
however  since july prior to our commencement of operations libor and repurchase market rates have varied greatly  and often have been significantly higher than the target federal funds rate 
the difference between day libor and the federal funds rate has also been quite volatile  with the spread alternately returning to more normal levels and then widening out again 
towards the end of the third quarter of this difference increased to historically high levels 
although this difference had returned to more normal levels by the end of december  the volatility in these rates and divergence from the historical relationship among these rates could negatively impact our ability to manage our portfolio 
if this were to occur  our net interest margin and the value of our portfolio might suffer as a result 
the following table shows the day libor as compared to the federal funds rate at each period end day libor federal funds december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  principal repayment rate our net income is primarily a function of the difference between the yield on our assets and the financing cost of owning those assets 
since we tend to purchase assets at a premium to par  the main item that can affect the yield on our assets after they are purchased is the rate at which the mortgage borrowers repay the loan 
while the scheduled repayments  which are the principal portion of the homeowners regular monthly payments  are fairly predictable  the unscheduled repayments  which are generally refinancing of the mortgage  are less so 
being able to accurately estimate and manage these repayment rates is a critical portion of the management of our portfolio  not only for estimating current yield but also to consider the rate of reinvestment of those proceeds into new securities and the yields which those new securities may add to our portfolio 
the following table shows the average principal repayment rate for each quarter since our commencement of operations quarter ended average quarterly principal repayment rate average principal repayment rate annualized december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  
table of contents investing the proceeds of our offerings we began operations following the closing of our initial private offering on november  we raised additional equity capital three times in the following is a summary of these transactions dollars in thousands except per share amounts date of offering number of shares of common stock sold offering price per share net proceeds november  february  april  ipo december  after deducting underwriting costs and other fees and costs associates with issuance 
while our operations are affected in many ways by the issuance of additional shares  the most significant immediate earnings impact is that we generally do not invest all of the proceeds immediately 
depending on market conditions  and the fact that normal trade settlement on agency securities is not based on the trade date  we have averaged around two months to invest the proceeds from these offerings 
since each capital raise was individually significant to the size of our portfolio  our results from operations  and some statistics regarding such results  may not be meaningful or portray the underlying fundamentals of our investment portfolio 
book value per share as of december   our book value per share of common stock total shareholders equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding was  an increase of  or  from at december  declining us treasury securities rates  us government actions  particularly the large scale purchasing of agency securities  and decreasing turmoil in the financial markets increased values on our securities to historically high levels 
our interest rate swaps  which fix the borrowing cost on a portion of our financing  generally help mitigate changes in our book value 
generally  the value of our interest rate swaps moves in the opposite direction of the value of our agency securities 
however  for much of  our swap values remained fairly level  or strengthened along with the value of our agency securities 
the following table shows the components of our book value on a per share basis at each period end as of common equity undistributed earnings unrealized gain loss on mbs unrealized gain loss on interest rate swaps book value per share december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  
table of contents investments agency securities as of december  and  our agency securities portfolio was purchased at a net premium to par  or face value  with a weighted average amortized cost of and  respectively  of face value  due to the average interest rates on these securities being higher than prevailing market rates 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of unamortized premium included in the cost basis of our investments

market price market value the current face is the current monthly remaining dollar amount of principal of a mortgage security 
we compute current face by multiplying the original face value of the security by the current principal balance factor 
the current principal balance factor is essentially a fraction  where the numerator is the current outstanding balance and the denominator is the original principal balance 
for a pass through certificate  the coupon reflects the weighted average nominal rate of interest paid on the underlying mortgage loans  net of fees paid to the servicer and the agency 
the coupon for a pass through certificate may change as the underlying mortgage loans are prepaid 
the percentages indicated in this column are the nominal interest rates that will be effective through the interest rate reset date and have not been adjusted to reflect the purchase price we paid for the face amount of security 
amortized purchase price is the dollar amount  per of current face  of our purchase price for the security  adjusted for amortization as a result of scheduled and unscheduled principal paydowns 
amortized cost is our total purchase price for the mortgage security  adjusted for amortization as a result of scheduled and unscheduled principal paydowns 
market price is the dollar amount of market value  per of nominal  or face  value  of the mortgage security 
under normal conditions  we compute market value by obtaining three valuations for the mortgage security from three separate and independent sources and averaging the three valuations 
market value is the total market value for the mortgage security 
under normal conditions  we compute market value by obtaining valuations for the mortgage security from three separate and independent sources and averaging the three valuations

as of december    and the hybrid arm mortgage loans underlying our agency securities had fixed interest rates for an average period of approximately months  months  and months respectively  after which time the interest rates reset and become adjustable 
after the reset date  interest rates on our hybrid arm agency securities float based on spreads over various indices  usually libor or the one year constant maturity treasury  or cmt  rate 
these interest rates are subject to caps that limit the amount the applicable interest rate can increase during any year  known as an annual cap  and through the maturity of the security  known as a lifetime cap 
after an initial adjustment cap  the average annual cap on increases or decreases to the interest rates on our agency securities is per year 
the average lifetime cap on increases to the interest rates on our agency securities is from the initial stated rate 

table of contents liabilities we have entered into repurchase agreements to finance most of our agency securities 
our repurchase agreements are secured by our agency securities and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
as of december    and  we had established   and borrowing relationships  respectively  with various investment banking firms and other lenders 
we had outstanding balances under our repurchase agreements at december  and of billion and billion  respectively 
hedging instruments we generally intend to hedge as much of our interest rate risk as our manager deems prudent in light of market conditions 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that our manager is required to hedge 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our shareholders equity 
as of december  and december   we had entered into and interest rate swap agreements  respectively  designed to lock in funding costs for specific funding activities associated with specific assets  in such a way as to assure realizing attractive net interest margins 
such hedges incorporate an assumed prepayment schedule  which  if not realized  will cause hedge results to differ from expectations 
these swap agreements provide for fixed interest rates indexed off of one month libor and effectively fix the floating interest rates on and billion  respectively  of borrowings under our repurchase agreements 
we have also entered into billion longer term greater than months repurchase agreements as of december  as a means of hedging our interest rate exposure 
results of operations we commenced our operations in november with our first private offering of our common stock 
we also issued additional shares three times during which significantly increased our equity capital  and thus  the size of our portfolio 
under our investment strategy  it generally takes some time to deploy significant amounts investment capital 
consequently  comparison of year over year data or quarter over quarter data  especially of gross numbers  may not be meaningful  or useful in predicting future results 
compared to our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per weighted average share 
this was a significant increase over the amount for the year ended december  of million or per weighted average share 
there were two main drivers of this trend 
the first was that  as mentioned earlier  we raised common equity capital three times during the last of these capital raises was in december since our invested assets grew  our total income also increased as we had a much larger portfolio for all of the major second factor was the continued decline of short term interest rates as our borrowing cost fell throughout 
table of contents our net interest income grew from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  similar to the previous paragraph  a larger portfolio combined with lower interest expense were the primary drivers of this increase 
in  our portfolio had an average yield of and a cost of funds including hedges of 
this resulted in a net interest margin or spread of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our portfolio had a yield of and a cost of funds of  generating a net interest rate spread of while the relative difference between our interest income and interest expense is more important to our performance than the absolute level of rates  the yield on our assets is a significant indicator of performance 
our gross yield in dropped from due to lower overall mortgage rates combined with higher prepayment levels 
at the end of  we had invested in agency securities with a weighted average coupon of 
these coupon rates declined throughout primarily due to continued government intervention in the mortgage markets 
our weighted average coupon at december  was 
after coupon rate  the yield on our assets is most directly affected by the rate of repayments on our agency securities 
our rate of portfolio repayment for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  low overall mortgage rates combined with us government intervention in the mortgage market created a significant increase in residential mortgage refinancing  and is a risk to earnings in the future 
at december   our portfolio had an average dollar price of per of face value 
keeping the price of our portfolio close to par helps predict costs associated with repayment speeds of our assets  as changes in repayments speeds have a lesser affect on income than a higher price portfolio 
our weighted average cost of funds not including hedges for the year ended december  was  decreasing from in the preceding year 
the main indicator of our borrowing costs is the day libor  which generally closely parallels the rates we pay on our repurchase agreements 
this rate libor dropped throughout and  ending at 
in  we incurred expense related to our interest rate hedges of million  as compared to million for the preceding year 
we increased our total notional interest rate swap amount from billion at december  to billion at december  lower repurchase rates combined with a lower overall rate on our hedges resulted in an average cost of funds for the year ended december  of  down from for the year ended december  we ended with a total billion of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average rate of and weighted average term of months 
additionally  we had fixed the borrowing cost on another million through the use of longer term repurchase agreements  with remaining terms of between and months at december  our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million which represents basis points on average daily equity 
the previous year s total expenses were million not including expenses related to lehman brothers default discussed in the following paragraph  which represents basis points on average equity 
the main component of our operating expense is our management fee  which is paid according to the management agreement and is based on total equity excluding unrealized gains and losses 
this comprised million of the total expenses 
the remaining expenses are share based compensation of million  which represents the amortization of stock awards to certain officers and directors  and general and administrative expenses of million  which includes liability insurance  auditing fees  exchange fees  and other administrative costs 
we incurred an unusual and non recurring expense in in september  lehman brothers inc lbi defaulted on the terms of a repurchase agreement we had with them and failed to return securities to us in which we had a net cost basis cost of the securities plus accrued interest receivable less repurchase funds received and accrued interest payable of million 
on september   lbi was placed under conservatorship by the securities investor protection corporation sipc 
the lbi estate is large and complex  and meaningful information regarding the status of the estate has not yet been released 
currently  management believes it is more likely than not that any recovery would not be material and has reserved the entire amount of the receivable from lbi 
if we receive any amounts in the future on our claim  we will record them as gains in the periods of recovery 

table of contents compared to our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per weighted average share 
this was a significant increase over the amount for the period ended december  of million or per weighted average share 
our initial capitalization was in november  so we had just begun to grow our portfolio 
we also raised common equity capital three times during since our invested assets grew  our total income also increased as we had a much larger portfolio for all of the major second factor was the continued overall decline of short term interest rates as our borrowing cost fell throughout most of for the year ended december   our portfolio had an average yield of and a cost of funds including hedges of 
this resulted in a net interest margin or spread of for the year 
for the period ended december   our portfolio had an average yield of and a cost of funds of 
this resulted in a net interest margin of for the year 
our gross yield dropped from our initial period in due to overall lower overall mortgage rates 
these coupon rates fell throughout the first half of and then remained fairly level the rest of the year 
our weighted average coupon at december  was as compared to a weighted average coupon of on december  our rate of portfolio repayment for the year ended december  was as compared to for both of these rates are historically low  but the rate for was due to our short time of operations 
for the rate was low partially due to the fact that most of our agency securities were new production or recently issued  and credit markets had inhibited homeowners ability to refinance 
at december   our portfolio had an average dollar price of per of face value 
our weighted average cost of funds not including hedges for the year ended december  was  decreasing from in the preceding year 
the main indicator of our borrowing costs is the day libor  which generally closely parallels the rates we pay on our repurchase agreements 
this rate libor dropped from at december  to at december   however it was not a gradual decline  with spikes higher throughout the year  especially around each quarter end 
we incurred expense related to our interest rate hedges of million  as compared to none for the preceding year  which resulted in a total cost of funds to for the year 
we had no interest rate hedges at the end of due to the newness and size of our portfolio 
we ended with a total billion of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average rate of and weighted average term of months 
additionally  we had fixed the borrowing cost on another million through the use of longer term repurchase agreements  with remaining terms of between and months at december  our total operating expenses for the year were million which represents basis points on average equity 
the previous year s total expenses were million  which represents less than months of activity and therefore not meaningful for comparison purposes 
contractual obligations and commitments we had the following contractual obligations under repurchase agreements as of december  and december  dollar amounts in thousands december  dollars in thousands balance weighted average contractual rate contractual interest payments total contractual obligation within days days to months months to months 
table of contents december  in thousands balance weighted average contractual rate contractual interest payments total contractual obligation within days days to months months to months december  in thousands balance weighted average contractual rate contractual interest payments total contractual obligation within days days to months months to months we had contractual commitments under interest rate swap agreements as of december  these agreements were for a total notional amount of billion  had an average rate of and average term of months 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are borrowings under repurchase arrangements  monthly principal and interest payments on our investments  proceeds from equity offerings  and cash generated from our operating results 
other sources of funds may include proceeds from debt offerings and asset sales 
we generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under its borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a reit 
our primary uses of cash are to purchase agency securities  pay interest and principal on our borrowings  fund our operations  and pay dividends 
during  we purchased billion of agency securities using proceeds from december common stock offering  repurchase agreements and cash 
during  we received cash of billion from prepayments and scheduled amortization on our investment securities 
we had a net cash increase from our repurchase agreements of billion 
cash interest payments on our borrowings totaled million in part of funding our operations includes providing cash margin to offset liability balances on our hedges 
this required million of cash to be placed in a restricted account with our counter parties as of the end of  a slight decrease from the end of due to the outlook for future rate increases 
as the long term outlook for rates increases  and as time passes  we expect to receive this cash back 
in response to the growth of our agency securities portfolio and to relatively weak financing market  we have continued to pursue additional lending counterparties in order to help increase our financial flexibility and ability to withstand periods of contracting liquidity in the credit markets 
currently  we have uncommitted repurchase facilities with lending counterparties to finance this portfolio  subject to certain conditions  and have borrowings outstanding with of these counterparties 

table of contents on october   we entered into a sales agreement the sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co

table of contents as of december   the weighted average margin requirement  or the percentage amount by which the collateral value must exceed the loan amount  which we also refer to as the haircut  under all our repurchase agreements was approximately weighted by borrowing amount 
as of december   our weighted average haircut was 
this decrease was due to easing credit market concerns and moderating volatility in asset prices 
declines in the value of our agency securities portfolio can trigger margin calls by our lenders under our repurchase agreements 
an event of default or termination event under the standard master repurchase agreement would give our counterparty the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due by us to the counterparty to be payable immediately 
as discussed above under market and interest rate trends and the effect on our portfolio  the residential mortgage market in the united states has recently experienced difficult economic conditions including increased volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality rmbs assets  due to news of potential security liquidations  increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets  and significant disruption in financing of rmbs 
if these conditions persist  our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of required equity capital or haircut  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
our agency securities have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and  as discussed above  the market value of our agency securities will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase 
when the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase loan decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut  our lenders may issue a margin call  which means that the lender will require us to pay the margin call in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call 
under our repurchase facilities  our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the agency securities we pledge to them 
most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market 
lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly 
we experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business  and under certain conditions  such as during a period of declining market value for agency securities  we experience margin calls at least monthly 
in seeking to manage effectively the margin requirements established by our lenders  we maintain a position of cash and unpledged securities 
we refer to this position as our liquidity 
the level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels  our haircuts and the price changes on our securities 
if interest rates increase as a result of a yield curve shift or for another reason or if credit spreads widen  the prices of our collateral and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity will decline  we will experience margin calls  and we will use our liquidity to meet the margin calls 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls 
if our haircuts increase  our liquidity will proportionately decrease 
in addition  if we increase our borrowings  our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness 
we intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in agency securities 
we may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity  which would lower our investment returns  or by maintaining insufficient liquidity  which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   the weighted average haircut under our repurchase agreements was approximately  and our leverage defined as our debt to shareholders equity ratio was approximately this leverage ratio was lower than our target range primarily due to heightened uncertainty regarding interest rate increases and asset prices 

table of contents forward looking statements regarding liquidity based on our current portfolio  leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements  we believe that the net proceeds of our common equity offerings  combined with cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements such as to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to shareholders and general corporate expenses 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital 
we may increase our capital resources by obtaining long term credit facilities or making public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we generally seek to borrow on a recourse basis between eight and times the amount of our shareholders equity 
at december  and december   our total borrowings were approximately billion and billion excluding accrued interest  respectively  which represented a leverage ratio of approximately and  respectively 
we have operated outside of our normal stated range during based on the risks mentioned above 
if we were to see conditions moderate we may increase our leverage ratio from our december  level to our normal operating range 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of investment securities is amortized or accreted into interest income over the actual lives of the securities using the effective interest method 
market valuation of investment securities we invest in agency securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of single family adjustable rate mortgage loans 
asc topic on investments requires us to classify our investments as either trading  available for sale or held to maturity securities 
management determines the appropriate classifications of the securities at the time they are acquired and evaluates the appropriateness of such classifications at each balance sheet date 
we currently classify all of our securities as available for sale 
all assets that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders equity 
the fair values of agency securities are generally determined by management by obtaining valuations for each mbs from three separate and independent sources and averaging the three valuations 
if the fair value of a security is not available from a dealer or third party pricing service or such data appears unreliable  we estimate the fair value of the security using a variety of methods including  but not limited to  independent pricing services  discounted cash flow analysis  matrix pricing  option adjusted spread models and fundamental analysis of observable market factors 
security purchase and sale transactions  including purchase of when issued securities  are recorded on the trade date 
there have been no sales of securities since inception 
gains or losses realized from the sale of securities are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method 
impairment of assets we assess our investment securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis 
when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date of the 
table of contents reporting period for which impairment is assessed  the impairment is designated as either temporary or other than temporary 
in deciding on whether or not a security is other than temporarily impaired  we use a two step evaluation process 
first  we determine whether we have made any decision to sell a security that is in an unrealized loss position  or  if not  is it more likely than not that we will be forced to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis 
if we determine that the answer to either of these questions is yes then the security is considered other than temporarily impaired 
there were no such impairment losses recognized during the periods presented 
derivative instruments we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the guidance included in the asc topic on derivatives and hedging 
this guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the guidance requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of income or be accumulated in other comprehensive income  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates generally with interest rate swap agreements 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and any distributions we may make will be determined by our board of directors based in part on our reit taxable income as calculated according to the requirements of the code  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to fair value without considering inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  or special purpose or variable interest entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  as of december  and  we had not guaranteed any obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets  interest rates  liquidity  prepayment speeds and market value while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to shareholders to realize attractive risk adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the primary component of our market risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and our related financing obligations 

table of contents interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part on differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities 
the cost of our borrowings will generally be based on prevailing market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with agency securities tend to increase while the income earned on agency securities may remain substantially unchanged until the interest rates reset 
this results in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the assets and related borrowings and may even result in losses 
the severity of any such decline would depend on our asset liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase 
further  an increase in short term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our investments 
if any of these events happen  we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods  which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of longer term repurchase agreements and hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increased in interest rates under billion of our repurchase agreements 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our agency securities 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the agency securities will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
hedging techniques are also limited by the rules relating to reit qualification 
in order to preserve our reit status  we may be forced to terminate a hedging transaction at a time when the transaction is most needed 
interest rate cap risk both the arms and hybrid arms that underlie our agency securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the security s interest rate may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rate increases on our adjustable rate and hybrid agency securities could effectively be limited by caps 
agency securities backed by arms and hybrid arms may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash from such investments than we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we fund a substantial portion of our acquisition of agency securities with borrowings that are based on libor  while the interest rates on these agency securities may be indexed to libor or another index rate  such as the one year cmt rate 
accordingly  any increase in libor relative to one year cmt rates may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that is not matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these investments 
any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability  which may negatively impact distributions to our shareholders 
to seek to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
our analysis of risks is based on our manager s experience  estimates and assumptions  including estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager may produce results that differ significantly from our manager s estimates and assumptions 

table of contents prepayment risk as we receive repayments of principal on our agency securities from prepayments and scheduled payments  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when we acquire agency securities at prices in excess of the principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying such agency securities 
conversely  discounts arise when we acquire agency securities at prices below the principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying such agency securities 
to date  substantially all of our agency securities have been purchased at a premium 
for financial accounting purposes  interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
in general  purchase premiums on investment securities are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment and cash flow activity 
an increase in the principal repayment rate will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums and a decrease in the repayment rate will typically slow the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
when we receive repayments of principal on our agency securities from prepayments and scheduled payments  to maintain a similar rate of earnings per share  we may want to reinvest the proceeds from these repayments in similar yielding investments 
in addition  due to standard settlement conventions  it may take time to reinvest these proceeds and leave a gap in earnings until we can find and settle on suitable investment assets 
in times of market illiquidity or tight supply  we may have periods where similar types of assets are not available to replace those assets repaid to us 
a decrease in earnings could be significant in periods of high prepayments 
extension risk we invest in agency securities backed by hybrid arms  which have interest rates that are fixed for the early years of the loan typically three  five  or seven years and thereafter reset periodically on the same basis as agency securities backed by arms 
we compute the projected weighted average life of our agency securities backed by hybrid arms based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  when agency securities backed by hybrid arms are acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated weighted average life of the fixed rate portion of the related agency securities 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates by fixing our borrowing costs for the duration of the fixed rate period of the mortgage loans underlying the related agency securities 
we may structure our interest rate swap agreements to expire in conjunction with the estimated weighted average life of the fixed period of the mortgage loans underlying our agency securities 
however  in a rising interest rate environment  the weighted average life of the fixed rate mortgage loans underlying our agency securities could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the term of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the remaining agency securities would remain fixed for a period of time 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency securities to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
interest rate risk and effect on market value risk another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our agency securities 
we face the risk that the market value of our agency securities will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effective duration of our assets and the effective duration of our liabilities and by estimating the time difference between the interest rate adjustment of our assets and the interest rate adjustment of our liabilities 
effective duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally estimate effective duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same securities 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis tables presented below show the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve  up and down and basis points  on the market value of our interest rate sensitive investments and net interest income  at december  and  assuming a static portfolio 
when evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on our manager s expectations 
the analysis presented utilized assumptions  models and estimates of the manager based on the manager s judgment and experience 
december  change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value december  change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value while the charts above reflect the estimated immediate impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio  we rebalance our portfolio from time to time either to seek to take advantage of or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on market value and net interest income can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the market value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond amounts shown in the table above 
in addition  other factors impact the market value of and net interest income from our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  interest income would likely differ from that shown above  and such difference might be material and adverse to our shareholders 
the above table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value  which includes the value of swaps  should interest rates immediately change 
given the low level of interest rates at december   we applied a floor of  for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions 
due to presence of this floor  it is anticipated that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level  however  because prepayments speeds are unaffected by this floor  it is expected that any increase in our prepayment speeds occurring as a result of any interest rate decrease or otherwise could result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and the reinvestment of such prepaid principal in lower yielding assets 
as a result  because the presence of this floor limits the positive impact of any interest rate decrease on our funding costs 
therefore  at some point hypothetical interest rate decreases could cause the fair value of our financial instruments and our net interest income to decline
