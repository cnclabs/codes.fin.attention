item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust 
meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic  operational  compliance  and financial risks 
set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 
if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the retail business is highly competitive 
in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price  merchandise assortment  convenience  guest service and marketing efforts 
guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores  our in stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete 
no single competitive factor is dominant  and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales  gross margin and expenses 
if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences  our sales  gross margin and profitability could suffer 
a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions in apparel  home d cor  seasonal offerings  food and other merchandise 
failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes  preferences  spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales  spoilage and increased inventory markdowns  which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations 
our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of the target brand 
we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary 
table of contents constituencies guests  team members  the communities in which we operate  and shareholders 
to be successful in the future  we must continue to preserve  grow and leverage the value of our brand 
brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities  and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence  particularly if they result in adverse publicity  governmental investigations or litigation  can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects on our business  including consumer boycotts  loss of new store development opportunities  or team member recruiting difficulties 
we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 
all of our stores are located within the united states  making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy 
in addition  a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california  texas  florida  minnesota and illinois  resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways  including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales  and reducing gross margins 
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales  these same considerations impact the success of our credit card segment  as any deterioration can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit  resulting in higher bad debt expense 
the recent credit card accountability  responsibility and disclosure act of has significantly restricted our ability to make changes to cardholder terms that are commensurate with changes in the risk profile of our credit card receivables portfolio 
demand for consumer credit is also impacted by macroeconomic conditions and other factors  and our performance can also be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use debit cards or other forms of payment 
if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
with over  team members  our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense  and our business is dependent on our ability to attract  train and retain a growing number of qualified team members 
many of those team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics 
if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members  our operations  guest service levels and support functions could suffer 
those factors  together with increasing wage and benefit costs  could adversely affect our results of operations 
lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth  and difficulty in executing plans for new stores  expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 
our future growth is dependent  in part  on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment 
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores 
in addition  for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer s ability to acquire land  obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project  of which our store may be one component 
turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects 
local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing  expanding and remodeling our stores 
a significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur within fully developed markets  which is generally a more time consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets 

table of contents interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results 
we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner 
if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments  whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons  we could experience merchandise out of stocks that could lead to lost sales 
in addition  a large portion of our merchandise is sourced  directly or indirectly  from outside the united states  with china as our single largest source 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  increased tariffs  currency exchange rates  the outbreak of pandemics  labor unrest  transport capacity and costs  port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
if our merchandise offerings  including food  drug and children s products  do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales  experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws  and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns  including food or drug contamination  could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 
in addition  negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs  resulting in lost sales 
in those circumstances  it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 
if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests  we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 
the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests 
if we experience a data security breach  we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 
in addition  our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products  decline to use our pharmacy services  or stop shopping at our stores altogether 
such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
our failure to comply with federal  state or local laws  or changes in these laws could increase our expenses 
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 
significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce which is not represented by unions as of the end of could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units  the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed  minimum wage requirements  and health care mandates 
in addition  changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit  medicare reimbursements  privacy and information security  product safety or environmental protection  among others  could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  particularly wage and hour laws  we could be subject to legal risk  including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
given the geographic concentration of our stores  natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations 
our three largest states  by total sales  are california  texas and florida  areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent 
such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers  and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores  which could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 
our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors 
changes in the tax laws  the interpretation of existing laws  or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due to the tax free nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 
if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit  our growth plans  liquidity and results of operations could suffer 
we are dependent on a stable  liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans 
in particular  we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures  the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital  and the asset backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio 
in addition  we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk  principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations 
disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements  fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures 
a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory  process transactions and summarize results 
our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  security breaches and catastrophic events 
if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly  we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them  and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions  which could adversely affect our results of operations
