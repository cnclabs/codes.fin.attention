we face vigorous competition for customers  loans and deposits from many companies  including commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  trust companies  mortgage companies  money market mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment firms 
many of these competitors are significantly larger than national penn  have greater resources  lending limits and larger branch systems  offer a wider array of financial services than national penn  and are long established in their geographic markets some of which have only been recently entered by national penn 
see general development of business below 
in addition  some of these competitors are subject to a lesser degree of regulation than that imposed on national penn 
many of these competitors have elected to become financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act of  including many of the largest ones 
this development will likely further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
see gramm leach bliley act below 
business strategy our goal is to become the most highly regarded financial institution in the markets we serve 
we intend to accomplish this goal by combining the sophisticated products and fee based services of a major regional financial services company with the personal attention  service and responsiveness of a community bank holding company

the primary components of our business strategy are commercial banking  consumer banking  private banking  specialized services  development of fee income  and enhanced customer service 
commercial banking 
commercial banking has been our historic and ongoing business focus 
our business customers tend to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between million and million

while currently receiving a reduced emphasis given the current stresses in our primary market areas  we also engage in commercial real estate lending  including loans to developers of both residential and commercial projects

enhanced customer service 
our business strategy is supported by a strong delivery system that places greater emphasis on customer service 
we have segmented our market into regions based primarily on geographic considerations 
each region is managed by a regional president who reports to the chief delivery officer 
this officer coordinates our sales and servicing efforts in order to effectively serve our current customers and gain new customers 
the purpose of this initiative is to better leverage our centralized marketing and servicing efforts  thereby increasing sales of the wide range of products and services that we offer 
we believe that this cross functional approach leads to more responsive service for our customers who  in turn  reward us with more of their total financial services business

capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
capital adequacy guidelines are intended to ensure that bank holding companies have adequate capital given the risk levels of its assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the guidelines require that bank holding companies maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a bank holding company s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories and its capital is classified in one of three tiers 
the required minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital must be tier capital 
tier capital consists principally of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangible assets

the operations of christiana are subject to regulations of the state bank commissioner of the state of delaware and the fdic 
the occ and the fdic  which have primary federal supervisory authority over national penn bank and christiana  respectively  regularly examine banks in such areas as reserves  loans  investments  management practices  trust  and other aspects of operations 
these examinations are designed for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders 
each bank must furnish annual and quarterly reports to the primary regulator  each of which has the legal authority to prevent the bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern  among other things  the scope of a bank s business  the investments a bank may make  the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain with its district federal reserve bank  the types and terms of loans a bank may make and the collateral it may take  the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations  and the establishment of branches  including community offices 
pennsylvania law and delaware law each permit statewide branching 
under the national bank act  national penn bank is required to obtain the prior approval of the occ for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by it in one year would exceed its net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  national penn bank may only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed statutory bad debts 
under the fdia  national penn bank is prohibited from paying any dividends  making other distributions or paying any management fees if  after such payment  it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements 
christiana is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to national penn 
currently  christiana may pay dividends to the extent of its accumulated retained earnings 
as subsidiary banks of a bank holding company  national penn bank and christiana are each subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  and on taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans 
the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulations also place certain limitations and reporting requirements on extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers  the executive officer and principal shareholders of its parent holding company  among others  and to related interests 
in addition  such legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a principal shareholder of a holding company may obtain credit from banks with which the subsidiary bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
regulation of other subsidiaries national penn wealth management  na  a direct subsidiary of national penn bank  is a limited purpose national trust company regulated by the occ 
national penn bank s other direct non bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the occ 
in addition  national penn capital advisors  inc and investment advisors  llc  investment advisory firms  are each primarily subject to regulation by the sec and various state securities regulators 
national penn bank s insurance agency subsidiaries are also primarily subject to regulation by the pennsylvania department of insurance 
monetary and fiscal policies the financial services industry  including national penn and its subsidiaries  is affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of government agencies  including the federal reserve 
through open market securities transactions and changes in its discount rate and reserve requirements  the federal reserve exerts considerable influence over the cost and availability of funds for lending and investment 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks now to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company a fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become a fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
national penn has not become a fhc 
national penn has  instead  utilized the authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 
glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as a fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the activities newly authorized for a fhc 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for a fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of most disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
fair credit reporting act the federal banking agencies have issued final regulations implementing the affiliate marketing provisions added to the fair credit reporting act by the fair and accurate credit transactions act 
the regulations  which became effective january   with a mandatory compliance date of october   require a financial institution to provide consumers with notice and an opportunity to opt out before using certain information received from an affiliate to make a marketing solicitation 
usa patriot act in recent years  a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers and increased information sharing 
it also substantially broadened the scope of federal anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence policies  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued a number of regulations to implement various provisions of the patriot act 
these regulations impose obligations on national penn to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing activities and to verify the identity of its customers 
failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on national penn s business 
interest on reserves drawing upon its accelerated authority under eesa see troubled asset relief program  below  the federal reserve issued an interim final rule directing that interest be paid on the required and excess reserve balances held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks 
the regulation became effective with the reserve maintenance period beginning october  fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program national penn has enrolled in the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg  which was established by the fdic in october as an initiative to counter the then current system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
the tlg provides two limited guarantee programs 
the debt guarantee program dgp guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions and their affiliated bank holding companies 
debt  including promissory notes  commercial paper  inter bank funding  and any unsecured portion of secured debt issued on or before june   is fully protected in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails  or its holding company files for bankruptcy 
the dgp debt guarantee is triggered by payment default rather than bankruptcy or receivership  and short term debt issued for one month or less is not covered 
the dgp guarantee expires on june   even for debt that matures after that date 
fees to participate in the dgp are based on the length to maturity of the debt 
the transaction account guarantee program tag guarantees noninterest bearing transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount  held by insured depository institutions 
in addition to traditional demand deposit accounts  the tag covers business payroll accounts  low interest now accounts and funds held in trust by attorneys  called iolta accounts 
insurance coverage under tag lasts through june  for tag participants  a basis point annual rate surcharge is added to an institutions current fdic insurance assessment to cover noninterest bearing transaction account amounts over  troubled asset relief program on october   the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law for the purpose of providing treasury with the authority and facilities to restore liquidity and stability to the us economy 
central to the eesa is the troubled asset relief program tarp  under which treasury can purchase troubled assets from any financial institution subject to appropriate terms and conditions that minimize the long term negative impact on us taxpayers 
on october   in a joint statement with the fdic and the federal reserve  treasury announced the creation of the tarp capital purchase program cpp to enable treasury to make capital investments in public and private banking institutions 
under cpp  treasury can purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms from qualifying us controlled banks  savings associations  and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies 
a participating institution may sell shares of its senior preferred stock valued between and of its risk weighted assets 
senior preferred stock ranks senior to common stock and pari passu with existing senior preferred stock  is non voting  and is callable at par after three years 
shares of senior preferred stock pay a cumulative annual dividend of for the first five years and in later years 
as part of the purchase transaction  treasury also receives warrants to purchase common stock in the institution equating to of the market price of its investment in the senior preferred stock at the time of issuance 
national penn applied to participate in cpp and received treasury approval to do so 
on december   by letter agreement  which included cpp standardized terms  national penn issued and sold to treasury i  shares of national penn s series b fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock having a liquidation preference of  per share and ii a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the national penn s common stock  without par value  at an initial exercise price  subject to anti dilution adjustments  of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the number of shares subject to the warrants was reduced to  in the fourth quarter of rules issued by treasury and certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act require participating institutions  including national penn  to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which treasury holds cpp senior preferred stock 
under these standards  the amount of bonus and incentive compensation that may be paid each year is limited  incentive compensation must not be designed to encourage executives to take excessive risks or to manipulate earnings  bonuses and incentive compensation based on materially inaccurate financial statements must be returned  golden parachute payments are prohibited  and certain federal income tax deductions are limited 
these restrictions generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and the next three most highly compensated executive officers but  in some instances  apply to a larger group of executives 
in addition  the american recovery and reinvestment act requires cpp participants to hold a non binding say on pay shareholder vote to approve the compensation of their executives 
participating institutions are also restricted from increasing their common stock dividend and from redeeming or repurchasing shares of their common stock while treasury owns the institution s senior preferred stock 
see dividend restrictions above 
these dividend restrictions and executive and corporate governance standards must remain in place for so long as treasury holds the cpp participant s senior preferred stock 
the american recovery and reinvestment act allows cpp participants  with the consent of treasury and the federal reserve  to redeem at any time the senior preferred stock sold to treasury 
upon the redemption of the senior preferred stock  the participant will no longer be required to comply with the dividend restrictions and executive compensation and corporate governance standards 
item a 
risk factors national penn s failure to comply with its agreements with it primary regulator may harm its business and financial results 
on january   national penn bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the occ  its primary regulator 
under this informal agreement  national penn bank has agreed to develop and implement initiatives to enhance the oversight of problem assets  enhance its process for the allowance for loan and lease losses  and strengthen its internal loan review and credit administration functions 
implementing and completing these initiatives may require substantial oversight of our senior management team and directors and may constrain our operations 
additionally  national penn bank has agreed to achieve by march  and maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  and to maintain a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
see part i  item of this report 
if national penn bank fails to comply with the memorandum of understanding  or if national penn bank is unable to achieve and or maintain its capital ratios at the agreed upon levels  national penn bank may be subject to further  formal supervisory enforcement actions  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operation and business 
national penn may need to  or may be compelled to  raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders 
federal banking regulators require national penn and its banking subsidiaries to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations 
these capital levels are determined and dictated by law  regulation and banking regulatory agencies 
in addition  capital levels are also determined by national penn s management and board of directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support national penn s business operations 
at december   all three capital ratios for national penn s banking subsidiaries were above well capitalized levels under current bank regulatory guidelines 
to be well capitalized  banking companies generally must maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as noted above  national penn has agreed with its primary regulator to achieve by march  and maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  and to maintain a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
in order to achieve these agreed upon capital levels  national penn may have to reduce assets  seek alternative means to increase capital  or both 
if national penn raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities  it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock 
please refer to the risk factor below titled there may be future sales or other dilution of national penn s equity  which may adversely affect the market price of national penn s common stock 
furthermore  a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on national penn s stock price 
new investors may also have rights  preferences and privileges senior to national penn s current shareholders  which may adversely impact its current shareholders 
national penn s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of its control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  national penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to it or to raise additional capital at all 
if national penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed  its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired 
additionally  the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect national penn s operations  financial condition and results of operations 
deteriorating credit quality  particularly in commercial  construction and real estate loans  has adversely impacted national penn and may continue to adversely impact national penn 
in late  national penn began to experience a downturn in the overall credit performance of its loan portfolio  as well as acceleration in the deterioration of general economic conditions 
this deterioration  as well as a significant increase in national and regional unemployment levels and decreased sources of liquidity  are the primary drivers of the increased stress being placed on most borrowers and is negatively impacting their ability to repay 
these conditions resulted in an increase in national penn s loan loss reserves at december  national penn expects credit quality to remain challenging and at elevated levels of risk at least throughout continued deterioration in the quality of national penn s credit portfolio could significantly increase nonperforming loans  require additional increases in loan loss reserves  elevate charge off levels and have a material adverse effect on national penn s capital  financial condition and results of operations 
national penn s allowance for loan and lease losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposure 
national penn depends on the creditworthiness of its customers 
national penn periodically reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including past charge off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets  and regulatory requirements 
as a result of these considerations  national penn has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses  most recently for the year ended december   during which its provision for loan losses brought the total allowance for loan and lease losses to million 
the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses because of unanticipated adverse changes to the economy caused by recession  inflation  unemployment or other factors beyond national penn s control 
if the credit quality of national penn s customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate  national penn s business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because its operations are concentrated in eastern pennsylvania  national penn s performance and financial condition may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values 
national penn s loan activities are largely based in counties in eastern pennsylvania 
to a lesser extent  national penn s deposit base is also generated from this area 
as a result  national penn s consolidated financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in this eastern pennsylvania region 
deteriorating local economic conditions during and caused national penn to experience an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in the number of borrowers who defaulted on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans 
a continued downturn in the regional real estate market could further harm national penn s financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this regional area and because a large percentage of its loans are secured by real property 
if there is a further decline in real estate values  the collateral for national penn s loans will provide less security 
as a result  national penn s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished  and national penn will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely impact the value of national penn s investments  financial performance and capital 
national penn maintains an investment portfolio that includes  but is not limited to  municipal bonds  bank equity securities  or individual trust preferred securities 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in business climate and lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities 
national penn periodically  but not less than quarterly  evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
national penn may be required to record additional impairment charges if investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if national penn determines that a significant impairment has occurred  national penn would be required to charge against earnings the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
national penn s investment portfolio includes approximately million in capital stock of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
this stock ownership is required of all home loan bank members as part of the overall home loan bank capitalization 
the home loan bank is experiencing a potential capital shortfall  has suspended its quarterly cash dividend  and could possibly require its members  including national penn  to make additional capital investments in the home loan bank 
in order to avail itself of correspondent banking services offered by the home loan bank  national penn must remain a member of the home loan bank 
if the home loan bank were to cease operations  or if national penn were required to write off its investment in the home loan bank  national penn s business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
national penn may incur additional impairments to goodwill 
national penn tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually as of june th 
national penn performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation in connection with the preparation  review and audit of its december  financial statements included in this report 
based on the results of its evaluation  national penn recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in  and as of december   had approximately million of goodwill remaining on its balance sheet 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including the lack of recovery in the market price of national penn s common stock  reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to national penn s business  could result in further impairments to goodwill 
national penn s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance 
national penn operates in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results 
if national penn s analysis results in additional impairment to its goodwill  national penn would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist 
any such change could have a material adverse effect on national penn s results of operations and our stock price 
national penn s ability to realize its deferred tax asset may be reduced  which may adversely impact results of operations 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires national penn to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
national penn s deferred tax asset may be reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset 
if it is determined that a valuation allowance of its deferred tax asset is necessary  national penn may incur a charge to earnings 
national penn s deferred tax asset was not included in regulatory capital beginning in the third quarter of at december  the deferred tax asset of million was excluded from regulatory capital calculations 
negative conditions in the general economy and financial services industry may limit national penn s access to additional funding and adversely impact liquidity 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on national penn s liquidity 
national penn s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact national penn s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against it 
national penn s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to national penn  such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets 
national penn s business operations are subject to pervasive and comprehensive federal and state legislation  regulation and supervision which could adversely affect national penn 
business operations of national penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state legislation  regulation  and supervision that govern almost all aspects of business operations 
this regulatory framework is primarily designed to protect consumers  depositors and the government s deposit insurance funds  and to accomplish other governmental policy objectives such as combating terrorism 
areas such as bank secrecy act compliance including bsa and related anti money laundering regulations and real estate secured consumer lending such as truth in lending regulations  changes in respa regulations  and implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators are being confronted with escalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny 
failure by national penn to meet these expectations could result in adverse action by regulators  which would negatively affect national penn s reputation and could adversely affect national penn s ability to manage its business  and as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
the impact of recently enacted legislation  proposed legislation  and government programs intended to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time  and such legislation is subject to change 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of  or the eesa  was signed into law 
under eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
pursuant to this authority  the us treasury announced its capital purchase program the cpp  under which it is purchasing preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions  including national penn  to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
in accordance with the terms of the cpp  national penn issued to the us treasury shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of national penn common stock at a share the warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the number of shares subject to the warrant was reduced to  after national penn s completion in the third quarter of a qualifying equity offering of more than million 
participation in the cpp subjects national penn to increased oversight by the us treasury  regulators and congress 
on february   the eesa was amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the arra 
the eesa  the arra and the rules issued under these acts contain executive compensation restrictions and corporate governance standards that apply to all cpp participants  including national penn 
for example  participation in the cpp imposes restrictions on national penn s ability to pay cash dividends on  and to repurchase  its common stock 
with regard to increased oversight  the us treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the cpp purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect national penn s corporate books and records through its federal banking regulator 
in addition  the us treasury has the right to appoint two persons to national penn s board of directors if national penn misses dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
the eesa  the arra and the related rules subject national penn to restrictions on executive compensation that are complex  far reaching  and unprecedented  and that could materially affect national penn s ability to attract  motivate  and or retain key executives and other key personnel 
in addition  national penn is now required to submit its executive compensation program to an advisory non binding shareholder vote 
congress has held hearings on implementation of the cpp and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that have obtained funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation 
although it is unclear what  if any  additional legislation will be enacted into law or rules will be issued  certain laws or rules may be enacted or imposed administratively by the us treasury that could further restrict national penn s operations or increase governmental oversight of its businesses and its corporate governance practices 
the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief program  or tarp  has requested information from cpp and other tarp participants  including a description of past and anticipated uses of the tarp funds and plans for addressing executive compensation requirements under the cpp 
national penn and other cpp participants are also required to submit monthly reports about their lending and financial intermediation activities to the us treasury 
it is unclear at this point what the ramifications of such disclosure are or may be in the future 
the ultimate impact that the eesa  the arra and their implementing regulations  or any other legislation or governmental program  will have on the financial markets is unknown at this time 
the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect national penn s business  results of operations  financial condition  access to funding and the trading price of national penn s common stock 
new or changed governmental legislation or regulation and accounting industry pronouncements could adversely affect national penn 
in addition to the eesa and arra  other changes in federal and state legislation and regulation may affect national penn s operations 
changes will be significant if congress enacts proposed financial regulatory reform such as the wall street reform and consumer protection act of which passed in the house of representatives in december in addition  national penn is subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations 
national penn cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in financial market regulation or accounting rules and interpretations will have on national penn 
any such changes may negatively affect national penn s financial performance  its ability to expand its products and services and or to increase the value of its business and  as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
national penn may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings 
recent bank failures have severely depleted the fdic s insurance fund 
in response  the fdic adopted a final rule effective april   which differentiates for risk in calculating assessment rates 
the fdic levied a special assessment to all insured institutions payable june  to replenish the fund and at december   required insured institutions to pay insurance premiums in advance 
any additional special assessments could adversely affect the company s earnings 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect national penn s profitability 
national penn s banking subsidiaries face substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
additionally  several of national penn s banking competitors are large financial institutions that have received multi million or multi billion dollar infusions of capital from the us treasury or other support from federal programs  which has strengthened their balance sheets and enhanced their ability to withstand the uncertainty of the current economic environment 
intensified competition from these institutions could reduce national penn s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that national penn s subsidiaries originate and the interest rates they may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  national penn s banking subsidiaries face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources from participation in the cpp or otherwise  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than national penn  which could decrease the deposits that national penn attracts or require national penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect national penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  national penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase national penn s cost of funds 
national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of national penn s non bank competitors are subject to less extensive regulations than those governing national penn s banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries in providing financial products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit national penn s margins on banking and non banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
inability to hire or retain key personnel could adversely affect national penn s business 
national penn s subsidiaries face intense competition with various other financial institutions for the attraction and retention of key personnel  specifically those who generate and maintain national penn s customer relationships and serve in other key operation positions in the areas of finance  credit administration  loan functions and information technology 
these competitors may not be subject to the limitations on executive compensation imposed under the eesa and the arra  may not be subject to federal taxation  and may offer greater compensation and other benefits  which could result in the loss of potential and or existing key personnel  which may result in the loss of potential and or existing substantial customer relationships 
variations in interest rates may negatively affect national penn s financial performance 
changes in interest rates may reduce profits 
the primary source of income for national penn currently is the differential  or the net interest spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
as prevailing interest rates change  net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re pricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to repay their obligations 
in a declining interest rate environment  national penn may be unable to re price deposits downward in the same magnitude and or with the same timing as the movement in its interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates  whether upward or downward  could materially adversely affect national penn s net interest spread  loan origination volume  asset quality and overall profitability 
if national penn s information systems are interrupted or sustain a breach in security  those events may negatively affect national penn s financial performance and reputation 
in conducting its business  national penn relies heavily on its information systems 
maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive  as is dealing with any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  whether due to acts or omissions by national penn or by a third party and whether intentional or not 
any such failure  interruption or breach could result in failures or disruptions in national penn s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
the policies  procedures and technical safeguards put in place by national penn to prevent or limit the effect of any failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems may be insufficient to prevent or remedy the effects of any such occurrences 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of national penn s information systems could damage national penn s reputation  result in a loss of customer business and data  subject national penn to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose national penn to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on national penn s financial condition and results of operations 
if national penn s information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments  national penn s financial performance may suffer 
effective and competitive delivery of national penn s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes  both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables national penn to reduce costs 
national penn s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
many of national penn s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
additionally  as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves  keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for national penn 
national penn s need to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel becomes increasingly critical  particularly as national penn may complete future acquisitions and enter new markets 
there can be no assurance that national penn will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce its ability to compete effectively 
national penn s internal control systems are inherently limited 
national penn s system of internal controls  disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures is inherently limited 
the inherent limitations of national penn s system of internal controls include the use of judgments in decision making that can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes  and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
because of the inherent limitation of a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected  which may have an adverse effect on national penn s business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving national penn s internal controls 
there may be future sales or other dilution of national penn s equity  which may adversely affect the market price of national penn s common stock 
national penn is not restricted from issuing additional common shares  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common shares 
national penn is currently authorized to issue up to million common shares  of which million shares were outstanding as of december   and up to one million shares of preferred stock  none of which shares are outstanding other than  shares of series b preferred stock  which national penn issued to the us treasury in connection with participation in the cpp 
in addition  as of december    shares are available for purchase under national penn s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and its employee stock purchase plan 
the employee stock purchase plan allows employee shareholders to purchase shares of national penn common shares at a discount from market value 
as of december    shares are issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units and or exercise of stock options that have been  or stock options  stock appreciation rights  stock awards and restricted stock that may be  issued under national penn s equity compensation plans 
the us treasury may  at its option  exercise its warrant to purchase  of national penn s common shares the number of shares remaining subject to the warrant after national penn s completion in the third quarter of a qualifying equity offering of more than million 
should the us treasury exercise its warrant or should national penn experience strong participation in the employee stock purchase plan or the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  the issuance of the required shares of common stock will dilute the ownership of national penn s shareholders and could depress our stock price 
national penn also has the ability to issue an unlimited amount of securities including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale under an active shelf registration statement  which it filed with the sec on november  national penn s board of directors has authority  without action or vote of the shareholders  to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares 
these authorized but unissued shares could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other shareholders 
in addition  national penn may decide to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury in connection with national penn s participation in the cpp 
to repurchase the preferred stock  national penn is required to obtain the approval of national penn s primary federal regulator which may require national penn to raise additional capital prior to repurchasing the series b preferred stock 
should national penn choose to raise capital by selling shares of common stock for any reason  including  without limitation  for the purpose of repurchasing its series b preferred stock or for increasing its regulatory capital  the issuance would have a dilutive effect on national penn s other shareholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of national penn s common stock 
national penn relies on dividends it receives from its subsidiaries  may further reduce or eliminate the cash dividends on its common stock  and is subject to restrictions on its ability to declare or pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock 
as a bank holding company  national penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
its principal bank subsidiary  national penn bank  is national penn s primary source of dividends 
dividend payments from national penn bank and christiana bank trust company are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by bank regulatory agencies 
the ability of national penn bank and christiana bank trust company to pay dividends is also subject to profitability  financial condition  regulatory capital requirements  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
as of december   national penn bank and christiana bank trust company did not have the ability to pay dividends to national penn without prior regulatory approval 
there is no assurance that national penn bank  christiana bank trust company and or national penn s other subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future 
in january  national penn s board of directors approved a first quarter cash dividend of per share  which was the same dividend declared and paid for the fourth quarter  but which was a reduction from the per share amount paid in the third quarter the board reduced the common stock cash dividend in the fourth quarter to preserve capital and strengthen national penn s tangible common equity levels 
there can be no assurance that national penn will pay dividends to its shareholders in the future  or if dividends are paid  that national penn will increase its dividend to historical levels or otherwise 
national penn s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is not only subject to limitations imposed by the terms of the cpp  but also to guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the federal reserve 
under this guidance  bank holding companies like national penn are advised to consult in advance with the federal reserve before declaring dividends  and to strongly consider reducing  deferring or eliminating dividends  in certain situations for example  when declaring or paying a dividend that would exceed earnings for the fiscal quarter for which the dividend is being paid  or when declaring or paying a dividend that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
importantly  this federal reserve guidance is relevant not only to dividends paid on national penn s common stock  but also to those payable in respect of national penn s preferred stock held by the us treasury 
national penn s failure to pay dividends on its preferred stock or common stock could have a material adverse effect on its business  operations  financial condition  access to funding and the market price of its common stock 
under the terms of national penn s purchase agreement with the us treasury pursuant to which national penn issued the series b preferred stock and the warrant  national penn s ability to declare or pay dividends on any of its stock is restricted 
specifically  national penn may not declare dividend payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series b preferred stock 
further  national penn may not increase the quarterly cash dividends on its common stock above per share  without the us treasury s approval until december  unless all of the series b preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred 
national penn s ability to repurchase its common stock is also restricted under the terms of the purchase agreement with the us treasury 
the us treasury s consent generally is required for national penn to make any stock repurchases until december  unless all of the series b preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if national penn is in arrears on the series b preferred stock dividends 
there can be no assurance that national penn will repurchase the series b preferred stock and the warrant or that national penn s regulators would approve such redemption and repurchase 
national penn has not determined if or when it will seek the approval of its regulators to repurchase the series b preferred stock and the warrant 
such repurchases are subject to regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance when or if the series b preferred stock and warrant can be repurchased or what the redemption price for the warrant will be 
until such time as the series b preferred stock and the warrant is repurchased  national penn will remain subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement with the us treasury  the series b preferred stock and the warrant  which  among other things  require national penn to obtain regulatory approval to pay quarterly dividends on its common stock in excess of per share and  with some exceptions  to repurchase its common stock 
further  national penn s continued participation in the cpp subjects it to increased regulatory and legislative oversight

the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance of the company for the year ended december  and financial condition of the company as of december   with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in this report at item the company s strategic plan is designed to enhance shareholder value by operating a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the company also grows revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions through expanding into new geographical markets  or through further penetrating existing markets or business lines 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
the company s financial performance is substantially affected by external factors beyond its control 
issues such as the length and severity of the deteriorating domestic economic climate  counterparty creditworthiness  the functioning and availability of liquidity in capital markets and consumer demand for products and services are all impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal government

risk factors  which is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan and lease losses the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance is considered by management to be a critical accounting policy due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered 
the company continually reassesses the allowance and charges off uncollectible loans against the allowance when circumstances do not warrant continuance of the loan as a viable asset 
recoveries of assets previously written off  if any  are credited to the allowance when they are received 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable loan and lease losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected defaults  estimated loss in event of default  and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans 
the process also considers historical loss experience  economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of acquired net assets in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually  which the company performs as of june th each year 
on an interim basis  the company evaluates whether circumstances are present that would indicate potential impairment of its goodwill 
these circumstances include prolonged trading value of the company s common stock relative to its book value  adverse changes in the business or legal climate  actions by regulators  or loss of key personnel 
when the company determines that these or other circumstances are present  the company tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at an interim date 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test in which the company identifies its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount  inclusive of the goodwill assigned it 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  an indicator of goodwill impairment exists and a second step test is performed to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
in the second step the company calculates the implied value of goodwill by emulating a business combination for each reporting unit 
this step subtracts the estimated fair value of net assets in the reporting unit from the step one estimated fair value to determine the implied value of goodwill 
if the implied value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired  but if the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the difference in the consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding reduction to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s business segments are its reporting units which are community banking and other for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
in performing its evaluation of goodwill impairment  the company makes significant judgments  particularly with respect to estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step test is required  estimating the fair value of net assets 
the company utilizes a third party specialist who assists with valuation techniques to evaluate each reporting unit and estimate a fair value as though it were an acquirer 
the estimates utilize historical data  cash flows  and market and industry data specific to each reporting unit 
industry and market data is used to develop material assumptions such as transaction multiples  required rates of return  control premiums  transaction costs and synergies of a transaction  and capitalization 
other intangible assets are specifically identified intangible assets created from a business combination 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of checking  savings and other acquired  low cost deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized over the lesser of the estimated lives of deposit accounts or ten years on an accelerated basis 
decreases in deposit lives may result in increased amortization and or an impairment charge 
other intangible assets also include customer lists and covenants not to compete 
these assets are amortized over the lesser of their contractual life or estimated economic life on a straight line basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for future tax consequences that arise from the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
changes in tax rates are recognized in the company s financial statements during the period they are enacted 
when a deferred tax asset or liability  or a change thereto  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  deferred tax benefit or expense is recorded for gaap purposes in the income tax benefit expense line of the consolidated statement of operations for purposes of determining the current period s net income 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are net operating losses  allowance for loan and lease losses  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale 
deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at net realizable value 
the company performs an assessment each reporting period to evaluate the amount of deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods  as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized 
if a valuation allowance is required  the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes the benefit of a tax position in the financial statements only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
for these analyses  the company may engage attorneys to provide opinions related to certain positions 
other than temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment security is less than the carrying value  the security is considered to be impaired  and as such the company reviews the security for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti 
this analysis is performed at least quarterly  and includes consideration of numerous factors including the time period for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  curtailment or suspension of dividends or cash flows  deterioration of financial performance or the creditworthiness of the issuer  the performance of any underlying collateral  and negative trends in a particularly industry or sector 
the conclusion as to whether otti exists for an investment security is ultimately based upon the company s evaluation of the recoverability above its carrying value and its timing 
in addition  the company considers whether it plans to sell an investment security and whether it may be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its carrying value 
when the company concludes an investment security is other than temporarily impaired  a loss for the difference between the investment security s carrying value and the fair value is recognized as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations 
for an investment in a debt security  if the company does not intend to sell the investment security and concludes that it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovering the carrying value  which may be maturity  the otti charge is separated into the credit and other components 
the other component of the otti is included in other comprehensive loss  net of the tax effect  and the credit component of the otti is included as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations

during second quarter the company re categorized approximately million in state and municipal bonds from available for sale to held to maturity  in order to mitigate the decrease in fair value of these long term securities in a rising rate environment and any corresponding decrease to other comprehensive income 
at the date of the re categorization  there was no unrealized gain or loss on these securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
other securities increased million  as a result of increased frb stock requirements due to the acquisition of knbt and the resulting growth in the company s capital which is measured each december a summary of investment securities available for sale at december   and follows dollars in thousands amortized fair amortized fair amortized fair cost value cost value cost value us treasury us government agency state and municipal mortgage backed trust preferred pools collateralized debt obligations corporate securities and other marketable equity securities total a summary of investment securities held to maturity at december   and follows dollars in thousands amortized fair amortized fair amortized fair cost value cost value cost value us treasury state and municipal mortgage backed trust preferred pools collateralized debt obligations total the maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the investment securities of the company at december  are presented in the following tables

in performing its evaluation of goodwill impairment  management makes significant judgments  particularly with respect to estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step test is required  estimating the fair value of net assets  in addition we utilize third party specialists to assist us during the testing process and in developing assumptions 
the techniques we employed included discounted cash flow analysis and the use of two separate marked based approaches 
our step one and step two tests incorporated recent declines in merger and acquisition values  changes to control premiums  synergies available to a potential acquirer net of transaction expenses  views on regulatory matters  and increased expectations for returns given perceived risk in financial services and banking industry 
in addition  our analysis incorporated certain financial results  which have been negatively impacted by credit quality 
the current economic climate was assumed to improve gradually over time  and existing legislative and regulatory requirements were assumed to continue for the duration of the analysis 
we determined that our business segments are our reporting units which are community banking and other for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
prior to the impairment test the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the community banking segment was million and the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the other segment was million 
upon testing  the other segment passed the step one test with its fair value more than in excess of its carrying value  inclusive goodwill assigned to it 
as a result  no further analysis was performed 
however  the community banking segment failed the step one test  resulting in a potential indicator of impairment and a step two test 
the step two test for the community banking segment resulted in million of impairment  for which the carrying value of our goodwill was reduced as of december  our net income was also reduced by million as a result of the impairment 
the goodwill impairment charge did not impact income taxes  since nearly all of our goodwill is not deductible 
our regulatory capital was not affected by the goodwill impairment charge  since goodwill is excluded from regulatory calculations 
additional adverse economic developments that further deteriorate industry or our performance could negatively affect the assumptions underlying our analysis and the estimates we made 
such developments could cause us to perform additional tests and record further impairments

information regarding the impact on financial results for these years is disclosed in the section entitled basis of financial statement presentation in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included at item of this report

national penn s management uses this non gaap measure in its analysis of national penn s performance 
this measure  core net income or core earnings  excludes the effects of non cash  after tax unrealized gains and losses 
management believes the presentation of these financial measures excluding the impact of the specified items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of national penn 
core net income or core earnings provides a method to assess earnings performance excluding one time items 
this disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with gaap  nor is it necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies 
the following table reconciles these non gaap performance measures to the most similar gaap performance measures year ended december  net income loss available to common shareholders after tax goodwill impairment charge after tax other than temporary impairment charge on investments after tax loss gain on investment securities after tax unrealized fair market value loss gain on npb capital trust ii preferred securities after tax fraud recovery loss after tax fdic special assessment after tax gain loss on sale of wealth unit after tax loss on sale of snc loans after tax serp accrual core net income loss available to common shareholders diluted loss per share available to common shareholders after tax goodwill impairment charge after tax other than temporary impairment charge on investments after tax gain loss on investment securities after tax unrealized fair market value gain loss on npb capital trust ii preferred securities after tax fraud recovery loss after tax fdic special assessment after tax gain loss on sale of wealth unit after tax gain loss on sale of snc loans after tax serp accrual core net income loss available to common shareholders net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them  respectively 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased million or  to million  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the low interest rate environment  declining loan demand  and a higher level of non accruing assets 
average interest earning assets for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to average interest earning assets for the year ended december  of billion 
on a tax equivalent basis  average yields on interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  average interest earning deposits in banks increased million in  as the rate paid on balances at the federal reserve bank was more favorable than selling fed funds 
the federal open market committee of the federal reserve board held the targeted federal funds rate constant at for the year  which had a negative impact on the yield on interest bearing deposits as well as variable rate assets that adjusted during the year 
average balances of investments also increased in by million 
the average yield on the investment portfolio declined basis points from during to during this decline is attributed to the low interest rate environment which impacted repricing of investments from the run off of higher yielding investments primarily cash flow from mortgage backed securities  the company s increase in liquidity position  and the impact of the cdos 
while average loan balances grew by million  the yield on loans decreased basis points to from in due to the low interest rate environment and to a lesser extent the negative impact of non performing assets on net interest margin which was approximately basis points 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  a decrease of compared to interest expense of million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits for the year ended december  the average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
as the short end of the yield curve remains at historically low levels  the company lowered rates on all deposit accounts 
the reduction in interest expense during is attributed to the combination of lower rates paid in all deposit categories and a corresponding improvement in the mix of deposits 
furthermore  the average cost of borrowings decreased basis points as higher cost borrowings matured and were not replaced during the year 
during  the company improved the mix of deposits between transaction and time accounts 
at december  the mix was transaction and time and at december  the mix improved to transaction and time 
net interest income for the fiscal year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on a full taxable equivalent basis decreased by basis points to in  compared to in the decrease in deposit and borrowing costs were more than offset by the low interest rate environment  the increase in non performing assets  and the increase in lower yielding interest earning deposits in banks 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
interest income increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  as a result of the acquisition of knbt and christiana in interest expense in increased million or to million from the amount of million due to an increase in interest on deposits of million  an increase in interest on long term borrowings of million  and an increase in expense for securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased of million 
the increase in interest expense on deposits is due primarily to an increase in deposits from the knbt and christiana acquisitions and the volume of interest bearing deposits and the average rate paid on these deposits in the increase in interest expense on borrowings is a result of an increase in the average balance of borrowings outstanding during due to the acquisition of knbt and christiana and an offset by a decrease in the overall average rate on borrowings

allowance for loan and lease losses the following table shows asset quality indicators for the periods presented dollars in thousands december  non performing loans non performing loans to total loans delinquent loans excluding non performing loans delinquent loans to total loans classified loans classisfied loans to total loans tier capital and alll classified loans to tier capital and alll total gross loans as referenced in the asset quality table  the levels of delinquent  nonperforming and classified loans have trended upward for the periods presented 
these are significant factors in the determination of the allowance 
at december   nonperforming loans totaled million as compared with million at december  when compared to total loans  nonperforming loans have risen to at december   up from at december  the deteriorating economic climate was the primary reason for the increase 
the categories of loans that comprised the december  balance of non performing loans were commercial and industrial loans of million  commercial real estate loans of million  residential mortgages of million and consumer loans of million 
delinquent loans at december  were million  compared to million at december  delinquent loans equaled and of total loans as the aforementioned dates  respectively 
delinquent loans are considered performing loans and exclude nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest all of which are considered nonperforming loans 
as of december   classified loans relative to total loans amounted to  as compared with at december  classified loans are identified through internally generated watch and past due lists  problems identified with borrowers and industries  the loan review process and financial statement reviews 
the increased level in classified loans is attributed to the national and regional economic slowdown 
as operating companies experienced a reduction in revenues and real estate companies experienced an inability to liquidate assets at expected prices in the time frame anticipated  both have realized losses and reduced cash flows and as a result have a perceived inability to maintain current debt service 
this triggers a review of possible  commercially reasonable  disposition of collateral as the net realizable value of the loan and recognition of an appropriate classification and corresponding provision to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company has identified and acted on potentially impaired loans expeditiously  as management considers prompt identification of problem loans to be a priority 
based on its analysis  including the increase in delinquent  nonperforming and classified loans  the company increased its allowance for loan and lease loss and its allocated reserve to reflect the deterioration of the overall economy and credit quality trends in the portfolio 
management increased staff levels in the workout and collection to address the situation 
the following table shows the composition of the allowance for loan and lease losses dollars in thousands december  specific reserves allocated reserves unallocated reserves total allowance for loan and lease losses specific reserves increased to million at december  from million at december  of the total impaired loans of million at december   million had a specific reserve associated with them 
the remaining amount was considered to adequately reflect the net realizable value likely from those loans after all prior charge offs 
a specific reserve is used where sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of an inherent loss  but where a loss event has not yet been confirmed 
allocated reserves increased during from million at december  to million at december  the increase in classified and criticized loans along with increased factors applied to these loans contributed million to the allocated reserve 
historical loss rates increased due to more recent negative trends and the higher weight applied to more recent experience in addition to economic and other environmental factors which continue to increase due to unfavorable economic and loan experience 
additionally  the loan portfolio stratification was refined to be more granular in order to more clearly segregate data according to their risk characteristics 
the unallocated reserve addresses inherent probable losses not included elsewhere in the alll due to imprecision in the estimation process 
the unallocated reserve decreased from million at december to million at december as the allocated portion of the reserve associated with higher levels of problem loans and economic factors increased 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses was million at december   and million at december  and as a percentage of total loans the allowance was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively

the company recognizes  however  that if economic conditions continue to deteriorate and consumers  businesses and real estate entities suffer further  additional losses may result in the loan portfolio 
the following table shows detailed information and ratios pertaining to the company s loans and asset quality dollars in thousands allowance allowance to total allowance allowance allowance to total allowance allowance allowance to total allowance allowance allowance to total allowance allowance allowance to total allowance commercial and industrial real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals unallocated total allowance a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended december   is shown below dollars in thousands december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial financial and agricultural real estate permanent real estate construction leases residential mortgages consumer overdraft total charge offs    recoveries commercial financial and agricultural real estate permanent real estate construction leases residential mortgages consumer overdraft total recoveries     net charge offs provision charged to expense acquired in acquisitions balance at end of year net charge offs to total loans and lease average total loans and leases allowance for loan and lease losses net loan charge offs increased to million in  compared to net loan charge offs of million in and million in the increased charge offs were in the commercial  real estate construction and consumer private banking product lines 
this increase in charge offs is a direct result of the economic downturn in both the national and regional economy 
charge offs and classifications reflect the deterioration of economic conditions and resulting failure of businesses  devaluation of assets and negative impact on consumer s ability to service debt 
non interest income and expenses for the year ended december   non interest income totaled million of expense  a million decrease over the million of income reported for the year ended december  included realized losses on investment securities totaling million  which included million of otti and million of losses on security sales 
the year ended december  included million of losses on investment securities which was comprised of otti totaling million offset by gains from sales totaling million 
the investment security losses in and were primarily due to the write down and disposal of the cdos 
the increase in the fair value of the company s subordinated debentures accounted for at fair value caused a million decrease to non interest income 
in  the fair value of debentures increased million resulting in expense compared to million of decreases which resulted in gains recorded in wealth management income also decreased million to million for the year ended december  primarily due to decreases in value of assets under administration which resulted from economic and general market conditions 
equity method investments  other operating income and service charges on deposit accounts all declined slightly from to the decrease was partially offset by increases in mortgage banking income and cash management and electronic banking fees 
for the twelve months ending december   mortgage banking income increased million or to million  and cash management and electronic banking fees increased million or to million compared to the increase in mortgage banking income was a result of a general increase in refinance activity from continued low residential mortgage interest rates 
non interest income decreased million or in compared to  primarily as a result of a million otti charge taken in the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in wealth management income  an million increase in insurance commissions and fees  and a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase in additional wealth management revenues was a result of the acquisitions of christiana and to a lesser extent knbt 
these acquisitions substantially increased the amount of assets under management 
the primary reason for the increase in insurance commissions and fees was the acquisition of the caruso benefits group and higgins insurance  subsidiaries of knbt 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts increase was primarily due to the increased number of accounts due to the acquisitions of knbt and christiana 
the million increase in net gains from fair value changes was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company s subordinated debt related to npb capital trust ii trust preferred securities which are accounted for at fair value 
non interest expense was million for the twelve months ended december   a million increase as compared with million for the same period in the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to million of goodwill impairment expense recorded in and a million increase in fdic insurance expense due to the special assessment and other increases in assessment rates 
other operating expenses increased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to million of loan collection expense  million of shares tax  and million of fhlb prepayment penalties 
these increases were offset by a million fraud recovery received in  compared to million of fraud loss in non interest expenses increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of christiana and knbt  which added employees 
premises and equipment expenses increased million or to million compared to other operating expenses totaled million  an increase of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the increase was primarily the result of increases in outside services expenses  communication expense  increased amortization of newly added intangible assets due to the christiana and knbt acquisitions 
in addition  the fdic insurance expense increased million  and million employee fraud loss contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
income taxes decreased million in to a benefit of million with an effective tax rate of 
income tax benefit was million in with an effective tax rate of  and income tax expense was million in with an effective tax rate of 
the company s effective tax rate was less than the statutory rate due primarily to the tax advantaged investment and life insurance income 
income taxes remained a benefit for  as after careful analysis  we determined that our net deferred tax asset of million was realizable 
in reaching this conclusion we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence present 
negative evidence we considered included a pre tax net loss in and the effect it had in evaluating cumulative losses for a period of time 
we evaluated the drivers of the loss and their nature 
specifically  the items we considered to be aberrations were the goodwill impairment charge of million  since it is non deductible and the losses from the credit deterioration and subsequent exit of our cdos in and the cdos had a higher risk profile relative to our strategy for the investment portfolio and the high credit quality of the remaining investment portfolio 
the higher risk was realized via impairments and losses upon disposal which resulted from pressures in the economy and  more specifically  stress in the financial services industry that began in and continues throughout positive evidence we considered included our ability to receive a refund for losses resulting from the disposal of the cdos of approximately million  strong earnings history  and a projected ability to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset with substantial excess  prior to the implementation of any tax planning strategies 
our projections incorporated current financial results  which have been negatively impacted by credit quality 
in future periods  the current economic climate was assumed to improve gradually  but existing legislative and regulatory requirements were assumed to continue 
these assumptions we used in analyzing the realizability of our net deferred tax asset are consistent with other analyses and judgments we made in the preparation of these financial statements 
however  if there are substantial  adverse economic developments that further deteriorate credit quality or our profitability  the judgments we made regarding our ability to utilize the deferred tax asset may change 
this would result in additional income tax expense being recorded in our statement of operations 
however  these events would not further impact regulatory capital of national penn or its banking subsidiaries as beginning in the third quarter of we began to and continue to exclude the deferred tax asset from regulatory capital  due to the application of the regulatory guidelines 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s board of directors has set general liquidity guidelines for management to meet  which can be summarized as  the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the demand from depositors who wish to withdraw funds  borrowers who require funds  and capital expansion 
liquidity is produced by cash flows from our operating  investing  and financing activities 
liquidity needs generally arise from asset originations and deposit outflows 
liquidity needs can increase when asset origination of loans and investments exceeds net deposit inflows 
in these instances  the needs are funded through short term borrowings  while excess liquidity is sold into the federal funds market  or invested in interest bearing bank balances 
the company employs a diverse capital raising strategy which may include issuance of additional equity capital 
in april  the company amended its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drp extending the discount on reinvested dividends and new shares purchased under the drp until the earlier of the date on which a total of million in voluntary cash contributions were received or december  the amendment also provided that voluntary cash contributions could  as of april   be made in amounts up to  per month  an increase from the prior monthly limitation of  during  million was raised under the company s drp and employee stock purchase plan 
approximately million in capital was raised through the drp since originally enhanced in november on june   the company terminated the discount for voluntary cash contributions and the  monthly maximum limit on voluntary cash contributions under the drp 
beginning on june   the company accepted monthly voluntary cash contributions in amounts not to exceed  each for investment under the drp on or about the th day of the following month  at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the investment date 
the company s largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and corporate and institutional banking activities 
the company also utilizes wholesale funding that comes from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources 
wholesale funding is defined here as funding sources outside our core deposit base  such as correspondent bank borrowings including the federal reserve bank of philadelphia frb or brokered cds 
in  the company opted into the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
on august  the fdic extended the transaction account guarantee portion of the temporary liquidity guarantee program to expire on june  this program provides unlimited deposit insurance for non interest bearing and certain low interest bearing transaction accounts 
the company s principal source of day to day liquidity is through wholesale  secured borrowing lines from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb and the frb  details of which are set out in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
during most of the year  we had no need to access these lines 
at no time during the year did we experience any difficulties accessing these lines 
the liquidity and credit crises faced by many financial and commercial institutions have not negatively affected our company s liquidity 
we have funds available to us at reasonable rates 
however  regardless of our comfort with our liquidity position at the present time  we actively monitor our position for any increased use of wholesale funding 
the company had historically high levels of liquidity at december   as evidenced by million of the million of interest earning deposits with banks represents unencumbered on hand liquidity 
our fhlb borrowing limit is billion and we had million in use  leaving an unused capacity of billion 
we have million in overnight borrowing capacity from correspondent banks 
at december   we had no need to access these lines and the full amount was available for use 
as measured using the consolidated statement of cash flows  for the year ended december   the company generated million in net cash and equivalents versus generating million in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in during  the company incurred otti charges of million and increased loan provision by million to million from million in cash used by investing activities in decreased to million from million in  while cash used in was million 
net cash used for the purchase of investment securities increased in by million compared to net cash provided from loans and leases was million in  as compared to net cash used of million in this change was a result of repayments of loans  sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market and elevated levels of net loan charge offs 
cash provided by financing activities was million in versus million in and million in the largest source of financing funds in and was million from core deposits compared to million and million in and  respectively 
also  in million of cash was provided from the issuance of shares of national penn common stock  net of issuance costs 
the company s largest source of revenue is net interest income 
interest rate risk is the company s most significant market based risk 
the company realizes net interest income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
loan volumes and yields  as well as the volume and rates on investments  deposits and borrowings  are affected by market interest rates 
additionally  because of the terms and conditions of many of our loans and deposit accounts  a change in interest rates could also affect the projected maturities of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base  which could alter our sensitivity to future changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration  among other factors  overall credit risk  operating income  operating expenses  and available capital 
the company s asset liability committee alco includes the company s president and senior officers in various disciplines including treasury  finance  commercial lending  and retail lending 
the committee previously reported to the board s directors enterprise risk management committee on its activities to monitor and manage interest rate risk and will report to a newly formed board of directors finance and investment committee 
management of interest rate risk leads us to select certain techniques and instruments to utilize after considering the benefits  costs and risks associated with available alternatives 
we usually consider one or more of the following interest rates offered on products  maturity terms offered on products  types of products offered  and products available to us in the wholesale market such as advances from the fhlb and brokered time deposits 
alco s principal focus is to manage net interest income while considering risk 
the company utilizes a net interest margin shock simulation model as one method to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile 
the model measures projected net interest income at risk and anticipated resulting changes in net income and economic value of equity 
the model is based on expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates our market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments over a twelve month period 
the company also incorporates assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
while actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  this model has proven to be an important guidance tool for alco 
the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  re pricing periods dollars in thousands three within months one year over three through through five months one year five years years interest earning assets interest bearing deposits at banks federal funds sold investment securities and other securities loans and leases total interest earning assets cumulative total interest earning assets liabilities and equity interest bearing deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the most recent calendar quarter 
the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will re price at contractual re pricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for re pricing immediately 
time deposits are included in the period in which they are expected to mature 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling rate environment and would decrease in a rising rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity eve 
this report forecasts changes in eve under alternative interest rate environments 
the eve is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in eve at december  are as follows dollars in thousands eve change in interest rate amount change basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points management also estimates the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net interest income 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect that a parallel interest rate shift would have on the company s net interest income dollars in thousands december  change in interest rates change in net interest income change in net interest income in basis points as measured by the net interest income analysis  the company should benefit in the short run by an increase in interest rates 
this is a change from prior years when the company was positioned to benefit from a decrease in interest rates 
the primary reason for this change was the increase in liquidity on the balance sheet 
this on hand liquidity was maintained in either overnight or short term investments 
the rates on these investments will increase commensurate with market interest rates  and will more then offset the interest rate increases to deposit accounts whose rates are sensitive to market rates 
the results of the eve analysis and the net interest income analysis fall within the compliance guidelines established by alco 
the company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
alco approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging 
the derivatives employed by the company currently include forward sales of mortgage commitments  as well as fair value and cash flow hedges 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading purposes
