overview in and prior years  we have been a leading manufacturer  processor  and distributor of residential and commercial building products and processed metal products for the building and construction  industrial  and automotive markets 
our building products are used by homeowners and builders to provide structural and architectural enhancements for residential and commercial building projects 
our processed metal products are comprised primarily of steel shaped to specific widths and hardened to certain tolerances as required by our customers 
we serve customers in a variety of industries in all states and throughout the world 
as of december   we operate facilities in states  canada  england  germany  and poland  giving us a broad platform for just in time delivery and support to our customers 
subsequent to year end  we disposed of the majority of the assets of our processed metal products segment 
see the discussion of this disposition below under the heading divestitures 
as a result of this disposition  the company will no longer report results of the processed metal products segment beginning in unless the context otherwise requires  all information herein regarding the processed metal products segment is as of december  throughout and intensifying during  prolonged financial market and economic turmoil impacting the united states and the rest of the world caused a significant downturn in the key markets we serve  building and construction  industrial  and automotive 
during the past two years  continued illiquidity in the financial market contributed to the significant downturn in key markets we serve 
the united states government offered incentive programs during to increase consumer spending in these markets  including the new home buyer and cash for clunker programs 
however  as shown below  the residential construction and automotive markets in north america continued to experience significant declines in volume for the years ended december  residential housing starts million million million light vehicle sales million million million the decrease in residential housing starts and light vehicle sales had a significant impact on the operations of our building products and processed metal products segments  respectively  by contributing to decreased sales volumes in each segment 
additionally  commodity raw material prices for materials such as steel  aluminum  and resins  have fluctuated significantly during the past two years 
these raw material prices impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and also impact the pricing we offer to customers on sales of our products 
during the first three quarters of  we were able to successfully manage significant increases in raw material costs 
however  commodity prices fell precipitously during the fourth quarter of and continued to fall during the first two quarters of the rapid decrease in commodity prices led to lower sales prices offered to customers and falling margins on our product sales during the fourth quarter of and the first half of commodity prices stabilized over the last six months of and the effect commodity raw material prices had on our operating results lessened 
we expect our gross margins to improve in if commodity prices continue to stabilize 

table of contents in an effort to respond to these market forces  we have focused on operational excellence and continued to take steps to position the company as a low cost provider of our products 
our efforts have resulted in the closing or consolidation of facilities since january  including six during we have also aggressively reduced operating costs to adjust to the decreased sales volume and maximize cash flows generated from operating activities 
actions implemented during included further staff reductions of  reductions in the salaries of the chief executive officer and chief operation officer  reduction in fees paid to the board of directors  suspension of salary increases and the company s match on k contributions  furloughs at many business units  limitations on capital expenditures  travel restrictions  and many other discretionary spending reductions 
we believe these actions have helped us meet our priorities for serving our customers and maximizing our liquidity 
many of our lean manufacturing initiatives for focused on reducing the working capital required to manage our business 
our achievements in this effort and reduced sales volume resulted in an million reduction in working capital from million as of december  to million as of december  this reduction in working capital has allowed us to reduce our total debt outstanding by approximately million from million as of december  to million as of december  as a result of our efforts to reduce costs  operating income for our most recent three month period ended december  improved from the same period in the prior year excluding non cash intangible asset impairment charges of million 
the following summarizes results of operation for the three months ended december in thousands percentage change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangible asset impairment income loss from operations net sales for the three months ended december  declined by compared to the three months ended december  due to a significant decline in volume plus lower pricing as a result of the economic conditions described above which have severely impacted the markets we serve and the price of products we sell 
despite the decrease in net sales  we were able to increase the company s gross margin percentage from in fourth quarter of to during the last three months of the increase in gross margin percentage was a result of stability of costs within the commodity markets and operating cost reductions the company made during selling  general  and administrative expenses also decreased by as a result of the cost reductions we made during excluding the non cash intangible impairment charges  we generated income from operations in the fourth quarter of million compared to the significant loss from operations in the prior year 
divestitures subsequent to year end  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the majority of the assets of our processed metal products segment 
the completion of this transaction on february  finalized our exit from the steel processing business 
this asset sale was part of our ongoing strategic plan to build a company with optimal operating characteristics and improved shareholder value 
our strategic transition included four other divestitures of steel processing businesses over the last four years including our former thermal processing  steel strapping  steel service center  and powdered metal businesses 
we used the proceeds from the sale of these assets to further reduce our outstanding debt 
as noted above  we sold our powdered metal business  scm metal products scm october scm was previously reported as a part of our processed metal products segment 

table of contents during  we determined that both our steel service center formerly part of the processed metal products segment and cabinet manufacturing formerly part of the building products segment businesses no longer provided a strategic fit with our long term growth and operational objectives 
in august  we sold the operating assets of our bath cabinet manufacturing business 
in september  we committed to a plan to dispose of the assets of our steel service center business 
we sold the majority of the assets of these businesses during the remaining period of and we expect to continue evaluating our businesses to focus our resources and capital on those areas that we expect will provide the best long term strategic fit 
the divestitures of our powdered metal business  steel service center  and cabinet manufacturing businesses as described above are properly classified as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the divestitures described above in item of this annual report on form k 
the february  sale of the majority of the assets of processed metal products segment will be treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements beginning with the first quarter of acquisitions we did not acquire any new businesses during and we acquired three businesses with complementary market positions in in march  we acquired the stock of the dramex corporation  a manufacturer  marketer  and distributor of a diverse line of expanded metal products through its locations in the united states  canada  and england

discontinued operations represent the income or loss  net of income taxes  attributable to our powdered metal and bath cabinet manufacturing businesses  which we sold in october and august  respectively 
the following table sets forth the company s net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december in thousands change due to total foreign change currency operations net sales building products processed metal products consolidated net sales decreased by million  or  to million in compared to  million in the severe economic downturn during the past five quarters and its effect on the key end markets we serve led to the significant drop in net sales as demand for our products decreased and volume fell 
a decline in customer selling prices also contributed to the decrease in net sales as customer selling prices are based  in part  on raw material costs  which fell significantly during the fourth quarter of and the first half of foreign currency also contributed to a million decline in net sales during compared to the prior year 
net sales in our building products segment decreased  or million  to million in compared to excluding the million impact of exchange rate fluctuations  the decrease in net sales was million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in net sales from our recurring operations was primarily the net result of declining volumes due to a significant slowdown in the residential building  commercial construction  architectural  and industrial markets 
declining customer selling prices also contributed to the decline in net sales during compared to net sales in our processed metal products segment decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decrease in net sales was primarily a result of a decrease in tons sold due to the significant slowdown in the automotive markets 
sales volume generated by this segment was significantly impacted by chapter filings of two of our automotive customers  chrysler and general motors  and the resulting plant shut downs that occurred during the second and third quarters of the processed metal products segment was also impacted by the decline in steel prices in the commodity market  which contributed to a decrease in customer selling prices 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the significant decline in sales volume as fixed costs were spread over less volume 
the decrease in sales volume more than offset our cost cutting initiatives 
the precipitous decline in raw material commodity costs also led to a decline in gross margin as high cost inventory was sold at lowered customer selling prices causing material costs as a percentage of net sales to increase  primarily during the first three quarters of we estimate that the misalignment of customer selling prices to raw material costs from our processed metal products segment resulted in gross margin decreasing by approximately 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the million decrease is primarily a result of a million decrease in payroll related expenses resulting from staffing reductions and lower incentive compensation costs  million of cost reductions from lower travel  marketing  and outside professional fees  and the impact of our other cost reduction initiatives 
our bad debt expense also decreased by million as a result of a charge recorded to reserve for a tier automotive supplier that went bankrupt in the fourth quarter of despite our effort to reduce costs  our selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to during from in as a result of the reduction in net sales during compared to the prior year 
in  due to a change in the estimated fair value of three of our reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of million 
the following table sets forth the company s income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december in thousands change due to total foreign intangible change currency impairment operations income from operations building products processed metal products corporate consolidated total change income from operations as a percentage of sales building products processed metal products consolidated our building products segment generated a negative operating margin of during compared to a positive operating margin of during excluding million of intangible asset impairment charges and million of foreign currency fluctuations  the building products segment generated operating income of million during  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in operating income was a result of the significant decline in sales volume 
the reduction in sales volume resulted in a decrease in operating margin as fixed costs were spread over lower sales volume partially offset by aggressive operating cost reduction initiatives that reduced the impact of declining sales volume 
our processed metal products segment incurred a negative operating margin of during compared to a positive operating margin of during the processed metal products segment was most significantly impacted by higher raw material costs compared to customer selling prices and low sales volume 
the precipitous decline in commodity costs  particularly in the first six months of  led to high cost inventory being sold at lowered customer selling prices causing the operating margin of the processed metal products segment to decrease percentage points during compared to the prior year 
operating margin during was also negatively impacted as a result of fixed costs being spread over significantly lower sales volume 
these factors more than offset our cost cutting initiatives and a million decrease in bad debt expense from when we recorded a significant reserve for a bankrupt customer s accounts receivable 

table of contents corporate expenses decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in compensation costs as a result of staffing reductions and lower incentive compensation costs 
corporate expenses also decreased as a result of cost cutting measures and due to a million asset impairment charge recorded during for software no longer in use 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in interest expense decreased million due to lower average borrowings during compared to the prior year 
we reduced debt outstanding by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  through debt repayments 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by million of charges incurred to write off a portion of deferred financing fees arising from our amendment and restatement of the senior credit agreement on july  and early repayment of our term loan under the senior credit agreement along with a million increase in losses generated from fair value fluctuations from our interest rate swap 
the benefit of income taxes for was million  an effective tax rate of  compared with a provision for income taxes of million  an effective tax rate of  for the effective tax rate for was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences and recording intangible asset impairment charges  a portion of which was not deductible for tax purposes 
these items were offset by state taxes which partially offset the reduction in the effective tax rate during the effective tax rate of for exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes partially offset by lower rates paid on foreign sourced income

table of contents the following table sets forth the company s net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december in thousands change due to total foreign change currency acquisitions operations net sales building products processed metal products consolidated net sales increased by million  or  to  million in compared to the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of dramex  noll  and florence which provided incremental net sales of million during excluding foreign currency fluctuations  net sales by our historic businesses decreased million  or 
this decrease in net sales was primarily the result of volume decreases due to the downturn in residential building and north american auto markets 
net sales in our building products segment increased  or million  to million in compared to excluding foreign currency fluctuations and the incremental net sales provided by the acquisitions of dramex  noll  and florence  net sales decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in net sales from our recurring operations was the net result of declining volumes from our residential products due to the effects of the slowdown in the residential housing market which offset higher customer selling prices on products used in the commercial  industrial  architectural  and international markets 
net sales in our processed metal products segment decreased million  or  to million in compared to although the cost of steel was higher for much of which led to increased selling prices for our strip steel products  a significant decline in volume due to decreased north american automotive production led to a decrease in net sales for our processed metal products segment 
gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin was a result of a better alignment of customer selling prices to raw material costs and lower costs due to lean manufacturing initiatives and facility consolidations  partially offset by the effects of a million increase in exit activity and impairment charges  an increase in freight costs  and reductions in volume 
the acquisitions of dramex and florence also contributed to higher gross margins for the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in compared to the acquisitions noted above caused an increase of million in excluding the effect of the acquisitions  selling  general  and administrative costs increased million  or  over the prior year

table of contents the following table sets forth the company s income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december in thousands change due to total foreign change currency acquisitions operations income from operations building products processed metal products corporate consolidated total change income from operations as a percentage of sales building products processed metal products consolidated income from operations as a percentage of net sales in our building products segment for the year ended december  decreased to from in gross margin percentage remained flat year over year as result of our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through lean manufacturing initiatives and facility consolidation 
these cost reductions were offset by increased exit activity costs and impairment charges of million 
selling  general  and administrative costs also increased million from the prior year due to increased amortization of acquired intangible assets from our acquisitions 
income from operations from our processed metal products segment increased to of net sales for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in operating margin percentage is a result of lower costs due to the completion of our consolidation of our strip steel business and a better alignment of customer selling prices to raw material costs 
corporate expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in corporate expenses was largely due to a million charge for software no longer in use and higher incentive compensation costs due to improved operating results 
interest expense decreased or million  to million in from million in the decrease in interest was the result of a combination of lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the provision for income taxes related to continuing operations for approximated million  an effective tax rate of  compared to million and an effective tax rate of in the lower effective tax rate for reflects the benefit of a decrease in our overall state income tax and foreign income tax as a percentage of pretax income due to adjustments recorded after completing state and foreign tax returns  an increase in income generated by foreign locations  and the result of a higher proportion of permanently non deductible expenses as a percentage of pre tax income in outlook due to the volatility and uncertainty of economic and market conditions  we will not be providing definitive earnings per common share guidance 
instead  we will provide our expectations of general trends in the key markets we serve 
regarding  we expect economic conditions to improve over  but we are cautious on the pace of recovery 
for us new housing starts  we are concerned about the impact of current unemployment levels  foreclosure activity  and access to financing 
therefore  we expect a modest improvement in to approximately  units from a trough of  units in we anticipate expenditures on repair and remodel activity will improve modestly in from levels  with pockets of growth in energy efficient markets while big ticket items will continue to be deferred  in the short term  until general economic conditions  credit availability and home prices improve 
we also expect commercial construction to lag behind upturns in the residential housing construction market 
thus  in the near term  our financial results will be highly correlated to changes in customer demand 
over the long term  we are confident that the fundamentals for new home construction  home improvement  and commercial and industrial markets are positive 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations  including working capital  the purchase and funding of capital improvements to our businesses and their facilities  and to fund acquisitions 
during the next twelve months  with the uncertainty in the general economy and the related negative effects on the building and construction  industrial  and automotive markets  we will continue to focus on liquidity preservation to meet our principal capital requirements 
as noted below in the cash flows section of item of this annual report on form k  we have been successful in generating positive cash flows from our operating activities to fund our capital requirements during the past 
in the future  we expect to continue our cost reduction initiatives and sustain strong working capital management to continue to generate positive cash flow 
on july   we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the senior credit agreement to convert our previous credit arrangement into a secured asset based credit facility that allowed us to remove many of the restrictive financial covenants contained in the second amended and restated credit agreement before it was amended and restated 
we believe that availability of funds under our senior credit agreement together with the cash generated from operations should be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principal capital requirements during the next twelve months 
our senior credit agreement provides the company with liquidity and capital resources for use by our us operations 
historically  our foreign operations generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and to purchase and fund capital improvements to their businesses and facilities 
as of december   our foreign subsidiaries held million of cash 
we believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet its future obligations and allows the foreign business units to reinvest in their operations and could eventually be used to grow our business internationally through additional acquisitions 
as a result of the turmoil experienced within the credit and equity markets  we continue to closely monitor the counter party risk of all of our creditors as a part of our focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund our principal capital requirements 
one of the banks in our syndicate was acquired by another bank in our syndicate in december we continue to monitor the financial condition of all the members in our syndicate  and based on the monitoring  believe that our current banking relationships will continue to provide the liquidity needed to support our principal capital requirements throughout over the longer term  we expect that future obligations  including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions  may be financed through a number of sources  including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities  or any combination of the above 
any potential acquisitions are evaluated on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets  and customers 
this opinion is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information and may change if conditions in the credit and equity markets further deteriorate  or other circumstances change 
to the extent that operating cash flows are lower than current levels or sources of financing are not available or available at acceptable terms  our future liquidity may be adversely affected

the following table summarizes the changes in working capital during in thousands december  change cash accounts receivable  net inventory other current assets assets from discontinued operations total current assets accounts payable accrued expenses current portion of long term debt total current liabilities working capital the decrease in working capital during was primarily driven by our focus on working capital efficiency and inventory management 
the accounts receivable balance decreased as a result of the decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable period in the significant decrease in inventory was the result of decreased raw material costs along with initiatives to reduce raw material purchases  reduce our investment in inventories on hand  and maximize liquidity 
accounts payable decreased million as a result of our initiatives to reduce our investment in inventories 
the decrease in accrued expenses is primarily a result of lower accruals for annual incentive compensation awards and other compensation 
the current portion of debt decreased as a result of the early repayment of all amounts outstanding under the term loan included in the senior credit agreement

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general  and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisition related assets and liabilities  which affects our depreciation and amortization costs  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which impacts the provision for income taxes 
management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions  and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
as of december  and  allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  were recorded  respectively 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including historical experience  creditworthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in first out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
on a regular basis  we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory  considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to complete and sell the product 
we compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary 
we recorded charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
no charges to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were recorded during the year ended december  we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
we recorded reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory of million and million  or and of gross inventories  as of december  and  respectively 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 

table of contents allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities 
when we acquire a new business  we must allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair market values 
we record any premium over the fair market value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair market value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets with definitive lives  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair market value of assets  the most difficult estimations of individual fair market values are those involving long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair market value determinations and engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair market value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
the following summarizes the amount of purchase price allocated to property  plant  and equipment  identified intangible assets  and goodwill for the acquisitions we completed most recently in in millions initial property  identified purchase plant  and intangible other net acquisition price equipment assets goodwill assets dramex corporation noll manufacturing company and affiliates florence corporation due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the estimated fair market value of long lived assets and the significant number of business acquisitions that we have completed  we believe that the recording of acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of december  in millions balance as of december  property  plant  and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method  an independent market appraisal of the asset  or another acceptable valuation technique 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of million and million as of december   respectively  are subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  as of october  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during  we tested goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of march and june based on lower than forecasted sales volume  revised long term growth expectations  and a book value of equity in excess of market capitalization 
we also continued to test for impairment as of our annual assessment date of october 
table of contents we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we have identified reporting units with goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined using two valuation methods  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the two valuation methods used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit consist of an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach includes a discounted cash flow model which requires us to use significant estimates and judgmental factors 
the key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow model include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the market approach consists of applying an ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization multiple to the forecasted ebitda to be generated by each reporting unit in and this approach also relies on key estimates and judgmental factors including revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies 
revenue growth forecasted for ranged from a increase to a decline compared to revenue amounts with further increases in revenues forecasted in and beyond for all reporting units 
the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections ranged between and  with the higher growth rates in those businesses that have experienced sharp declines due to the downturn in the residential housing market 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years which reflects our estimate of long term gross domestic product growth 
operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms by in the individual reporting units as we expect the residential housing industry to recover over the next few years 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital was determined to be between and based upon an analysis of similar companies including their debt to equity ratio  related volatility  and the size of their market capitalization 
the multiples were estimated between and times ebitda and between and times ebitda based on an analysis of peer companies  including their ebitda  market capitalization  and net debt balance 
each reporting unit was assigned a different weighted average cost of capital and ebitda multiple based on our perceived risk of each reporting unit reaching its forecasted cash flow targets 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
as a result of the significant decline in expected future sales volume  we determined goodwill was impaired as of our march  and october  impairment tests and recorded million of goodwill impairment charges during we projected a decrease in future sales for three reporting units  which led to a decreased fair value for each of these reporting units 
if our reporting units do not experience forecasted revenue growth or do not generate higher operating margins when economic conditions improve  an additional goodwill impairment charge could be recorded 
the remaining goodwill assigned to these reporting units equaled million as of december  no goodwill impairments were recorded during the years ended december  and other than the three reporting which recorded goodwill impairment charges as a result of our october  test  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than except for two reporting units reported as components of our building products segment 
the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively 
goodwill assigned to these reporting units equaled million and million as of december  
table of contents while any assumption could reasonably differ from those we used  we believe the overall fair values of our reporting units are reasonable as the values are derived from reasonable assumptions 
the following table provides a sensitivity analysis regarding the eight reporting units with a fair value in excess of their carrying value as of our october  goodwill impairment test number of reporting units with fair value exceeding with carrying value change in carrying value by less in excess of fair assumption assumption than value weighted average cost of capital basis point increase terminal growth basis point decrease ebitda multiple decrease we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
we recognized impairment charges of million for indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our october  impairment test 
no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded for the years ended december  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between financial statement and tax income  provisions for uncertain tax positions  state taxes  and income generated by international operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the year ended december   deferred income tax liabilities decreased primarily as a result of the tax effect of the million intangible asset impairment charges 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to additional equity compensation recognized during regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained valuation allowances of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of capital losses and state net operating losses 
the valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties to the tax authorities as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized million  million  and million of interest net of federal tax benefit and penalties  respectively 

table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance now codified in the accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted january  the guidance addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
accordingly  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the result of the company s reassessment of its tax positions upon adoption of the guidance resulted in a million increase in tax liabilities with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings as of january  as of december  and  the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively 
we reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions after the internal revenue service concluded their examination of our income tax returns for   and and her majesty s revenue and customs united kingdom concluded their examination of our tax returns for and due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid
