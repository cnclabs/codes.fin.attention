table of contents overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices that provide a unique therapy  vns therapy  for the treatment of epilepsy  depression and other disorders as approved by the applicable regulatory bodies 
our ability to successfully expand the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable insurance coverage  coding and reimbursement for the device  the implant procedure and follow up care 
currently  there is broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  which we estimate pays for approximately of the vns therapy implants  issues an annual update to the reimbursement amounts received by our customers 
in calendar year  cms announced increases in the rates reimbursed to our customers for the implant procedure for both the generator and the lead portion of the vns therapy system effective for calendar year future decreases in rei mbursement rates could have an adverse impact on our business and our future operating results 
we are focused on improving the efficacy of vns therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy as a basis for maintaining and extending reimbursement 
this involves increased investment in research and development  specifically  seizure detection  responsive stimulation and associated technology  and likely includes additional investment in clinical studies using vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development  clinical studies and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
as of april   we incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period

net sales for the weeks ended april  were million  which consisted of us net product sales of million  international net sales of million and licensing revenue of million 

table of contents us net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume increase of and increased average selling prices of 
the volume increase was partially due to the extra week in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year the average selling price increased  in part  due to higher market penetration of our new models  the demipulse and demipulse duo 
international net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  as compared to the weeks ended april   due to a sales volume increase of  offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of 
the average selling prices decreased due to increasing sales to distributors and unfavorable foreign currency movements 
sales to distributors are generally at lower prices than sales through our own employees 
us net product sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  compared to the weeks ended april  due to a volume increase of and increased average selling prices of 
the average selling price increased  in part  due to the market penetration of our new models  the demipulse and demipulse duo generators 
international net sales for the weeks ended april  increased by million  or  compared to the weeks ended april   due primarily to an increase in the average selling price 
the increase in international pricing was due to market penetration of our new models  offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign currency movements 
us net sales attributable to the depression indication have continued to decline significantly since the cms s may issuance of a national non coverage determination with respect to vns therapy for depression 
we estimate that our net domestic sales attributable to depression for the weeks ended april  were approximately million compared to million for the weeks ended april  and million for the weeks ended april  gross profit margin the gross profit margins for the weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april  and april  were  and  respectively 
these increases in the gross profit margin have been primarily a result of increasing production volumes and increased sales of the newer demipulse generators that have slightly higher margins as compared to older models 
cost of sales  a component of our gross profit margin  consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
gross profit margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix between the newer demipulse generators and older models  us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system sellin g price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
we are currently paying a royalty covering our generator and lead net sales  however  we do not expect this royalty payment to be due under the terms of our license agreement after july  if we were to market products utilizing non expired patents covered by our agreements  additional royalties would be due

r d expenses were million for the weeks ended april   an increase in expense of million  or  as compared to million for the weeks ended april  this increase was due to an increase in compensation expense incurred as a result of the extra week in the fiscal year and an increased emphasis on product development efforts with respect to the treatment of refractory epilepsy  which was partly offset by a decrease of clinical and regulatory expenses related primarily to the dosing study 
r  d expenses for the weeks ended april  decreased by approximately million  or  as compared to the r d expenses of million for the weeks ended april  this decrease was primarily due to decreased clinical expenses relating to depression post approval studies and decreased international clinical expenses partially offset by increased engineering expenses for product development

table of contents income taxes during the weeks ended april  we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  and as a result  reduced our valuation allowance by approximately million due to the expected realization of deferred tax assets in the fiscal years after april  this partial reduction in the valuation allowance was a discrete event and was recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations during the thirteen weeks ended october  our effective tax rate for the weeks ended april  was approximately  not including the discrete adjustment to the valuation allowance  consisting primarily of federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as a result of the reversal of valuation allowance  we expect that our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ending april  will be app roximately to  subject to a possible recognition of future deferred tax assets by a partial or full reduction of the remaining balance of the valuation allowance 
we increased our federal tax rate to from  and as a result  our estimated federal taxable income increased by approximately  for the weeks ended april   and our deferred tax assets increased by approximately million  the effects of which were offset in the consolidated statement of operations and financial position by a change in the valuation allowance

table of contents non gaap financial measures we disclose financial measurements in our press announcements and conference calls that present financial information that is not in accordance with gaap 
management uses and presents non gaap net income and non gaap income per diluted share because management believes that in order to properly understand our short and long term financial trends  the impact of these unusual items should be eliminated from on going operating activities 
these measurements are not a substitute for gaap measurements  although we use these measurements as aids in monitoring our on going financial performance on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies 
non gaap net income and non gaap income per diluted share measure the income and income per share of the company excluding the gain on early extinguishment of o ur convertible notes and the impact of the discreet reduction in valuation allowance which was recorded in the fiscal year ended april   which are considered by management to be outside of our normal on going operations of the company 
we also use earnings before interest  other income expense  the income tax provision  depreciation and amortization  non cash equity compensation and gain on early extinguishment of our convertible notes to arrive at adjusted non gaap ebitda 
non gaap financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from  and therefore may not be comparable to  similarly titled measures used by other companies 
investors should consider non gaap measures in addition to  and not a substitute for  or superior to  financial performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table sets forth the reconciliation between gaap and non gaap financial measures weeks ended weeks ended april  april  april  net income loss deduct gain on early extinguishment of debt  includes tax  interest and amortization deduct tax benefit for the reduction in the valuation allowance non gaap adjusted net income diluted shares outstanding effect of removing the tax benefit for reduction of the valuation allowance on the convertible notes outstanding at april  non gaap adjusted diluted shares outstanding diluted income per share non gaap adjusted diluted income per share income from operations depreciation and amortization equity based compensation adjusted ebitda changes in the non gaap adjusted net income  non gaap adjusted diluted shares outstanding  non gaap adjusted diluted income per share and non gaap adjusted ebitda are primarily due to increasing sales and gross margins as discussed above in detail 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash cash decreased by million during the weeks ended april  to million  primarily due to cash used to repurchase million principal value of our convertible notes at a purchase price of million and the purchases of property and equipment and intellectual property of million  offset by cash provided by operations of million 
cash decreased by million during the weeks ended april  to million primarily due to cash used to repurchase million principal value of our convertible notes at a purchase price of million and the purchases of property and equipment of million  offset by increases in cash provided by operations of million and stock option exercises of million 
we believe our current financial and capital resources  including cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund anticipated business activities  including increased investing activities  through the fiscal year  although there can be no assurance of this  as this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold true 
our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results that are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
cash flows cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities were as follows weeks ended weeks ended april  april  april  operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  increased million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to a million increase in income from operations 
cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  increased million as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to an increase in sales and gross margin improvement resulting in overall profitable operations in fiscal year investing activities cash used in investing activities during the weeks ended april  increased by million  as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to increased investment for business infrastructure  research capabilities  acquisition of rights to product components and to license selected patents from third parties

financing activities cash used in financing activities during the weeks ended april  decreased by million  as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to decreased repurchases of our convertible notes  offset by a an increase in cash used to purchase treasury stock and a decrease in cash proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash used in financing activities during the weeks ended april  increased million  as compared to the weeks ended april   primarily due to the start of our convertible notes repurchase program in the fiscal year

table of contents factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk on interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and our convertible notes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not hedge our interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
based on the average outstanding balances in cash and cash equivalents as of april   a basis point change in interest rates as of april  would not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with respect to the us dollar versus the euro 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indi cates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon net income for the weeks ended april  would have been favorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on net income for the weeks ended april  would have been unfavorable by approximately  or 
we measure the foreign currency exchange risk of our foreign currency balances using period end rates and we measure the translation risk associated with our subsidiary in belgium  which uses the euro for its functional currency  using yearly average rates 
convertible notes risk the estimated fair value of our convertible notes was approximately million  based on the outstanding liability of approximately million as of april  because we pay fixed interest coupons on the convertible notes  market interest rate fluctuations do not impact our debt interest payments 
however  the fair value of our convertible notes fluctuates as a result of changes in the price of our common stock  changes in market interest rates  changes in our credit worthiness and changes in the overall credit market 
generally  the fair market value of our convertible notes increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of our convertible notes may also increase as the market price of our common stock rises and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
at april   a decrease or a increase in the price of our common stock would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our convertible notes 
we are required by the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the financial accounting standards board s accounting standard codification to disclose the level of inputs used to determine fair value of our convertible notes 
we believe the inputs fall into level  meaning that the inputs to the fair value measurement are observable  either directly or indirectly
