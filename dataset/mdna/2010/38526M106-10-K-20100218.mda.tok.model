we primarily focus on recruiting and educating working adults  whom we define as students age or older who are pursuing a degree while employed 
as of december   approximately of our online students were age or older 
we believe that working adults are attracted to the convenience and flexibility of our online programs because they can study and interact with faculty and classmates during times that suit their schedules 
we also believe that working adults represent an attractive student population because they are better able to finance their education  more readily recognize the benefits of a postsecondary degree  and have higher persistence and completion rates than students generally 
we have experienced significant growth in enrollment  net revenue  and operating income over the last several years 
our enrollment at december  was approximately  representing an increase of approximately over our enrollment at december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  we seek to achieve continued growth in a manner that reinforces our reputation for providing academically rigorous  career oriented educational programs that advance the careers of our students

we are regulated by the department of education as a result of our participation in the federal student financial aid programs authorized by title iv of the higher education act hereafter  title iv  and  at the state level  we are licensed to operate and offer our programs by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education 
in addition  we have specialized accreditations for certain programs from the association of collegiate business schools and programs  the commission on collegiate nursing education  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education 
we believe that our institution wide state authorization and regional accreditation  together with these specialized accreditations  reflect the quality of our programs  enhance their marketability  and improve the employability of our graduates 
we believe that our online capabilities  combined with our year heritage as a traditional campus based university  differentiate us in the for profit postsecondary market and enhance the reputation of our degree programs among students and employers 
our online students benefit from our flexible  interactive online platform  which we believe offers a highly effective delivery medium for our programs  yet are enrolled in a university with a traditional campus  faculty  facilities  and athletic programs 
we require our online faculty to undergo training in the delivery of online programs before teaching their initial course  while our full time ground faculty help maintain the consistency and quality of our online programs by supervising and conducting peer reviews of our online faculty  and participating as subject matter experts in the development of our online curricula 
our campus also offers our ground students  faculty and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience 

table of contents history grand canyon college was founded in prescott  arizona in as a traditional  private  non profit college and moved to its existing campus in phoenix  arizona in established as a baptist affiliated institution with a strong emphasis on religious studies  the school initially focused on offering bachelor s degree programs in education 
over the years  the school expanded its curricula to include programs in the sciences  nursing  business  music  and arts 
the college obtained regional accreditation in from the commission on institutions of higher education  north central association of colleges and schools  the predecessor to the higher learning commission  and began offering nursing programs and master s degree programs in education and business in the s 
in  it achieved university status and became grand canyon university 
the university introduced its first distance learning programs in  and launched its first online programs in in business and education 
in early  it discontinued its baptist affiliation and became a non denominational christian university 
in late  the school s board of trustees initiated a process to evaluate alternatives as a result of the school s poor financial condition and  in february  several of our current stockholders acquired the assets of the school and converted its operations to a for profit institution 
since february  we have enhanced our senior management team  expanded our online platform and programs  initiated an infrastructure and technology improvement plan and launched a marketing and branding effort to further differentiate us in the markets in which we operate and support our continued growth 
we have also made investments to enhance our student and technology support services 
we believe these investments  combined with our management expertise  provide a platform that will support continued enrollment and revenue growth 
we have also maintained our non denominational christian identity  with many of our undergraduate programs including christian study requirements 
our approach to academic quality some of the key elements that we focus on to promote a high level of academic quality include academically rigorous  career oriented curricula 
we create academically rigorous curricula that are designed to enable all students to gain the foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and demonstrable skills required to be successful in their chosen fields 
our curriculum is designed and delivered by faculty that are committed to delivering a high quality  rigorous education 
we design our curricula to address specific career oriented objectives that we believe working adult students in the disciplines we serve are seeking 
through this combination  we believe that we produce graduates that can compete and become leaders in their chosen fields 
qualified faculty 
we demonstrate our commitment to high quality education by hiring qualified faculty with relevant practical experience 
substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective field and of our faculty members hold a doctoral degree 
many of our faculty members are able to integrate relevant  practical experiences from their professional careers into the courses they teach 
we invest in the professional development of our faculty members by providing training in traditional and online teaching techniques  hosting events and discussion forums that foster sharing of best practices  and continually assessing teaching effectiveness through peer reviews and student evaluations 
standardized course design 
we employ a standardized curriculum development process to ensure a consistent learning experience with frequent faculty student interaction in our courses 
we thereafter continuously review our programs in an effort to ensure that they remain consistent  up to date  and effective in producing the desired learning outcomes 
we also regularly review student surveys to identify opportunities for course modifications and upgrades 
effective student services 
we establish teams comprised of enrollment  academic and finance personnel that act as the primary support contact point for each of our students  beginning at the application stage and continuing through graduation 
in recent years  we have also concentrated on improving the technology used to support student learning  including enhancing our online learning platform and further improving student services through the implementation of online interfaces 
as a result  many of our support services  including academic  administrative  library  and career services  are accessible online  generally allowing users to access these services at a time and in a manner that is generally convenient to them 

table of contents continual academic oversight 
we have centralized the assessment functions for all of our programs through our office of assessment  which continuously evaluates the desired learning outcomes for each of our programs 
we continuously assess outcomes data to determine whether our students graduate with the knowledge  competencies  and skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace 
the office of assessment also initiates and manages periodic examinations of our curricula by internal and external reviewers to evaluate and verify program quality and workplace applicability 
based on these processes and student feedback  we determine whether to modify or discontinue programs that do not meet our standards or market needs  or to create new programs 
the office of assessment also oversees assessment of mission based competencies 
we also offer the following features in an effort to enrich the academic experience of current and prospective students flexibility in program delivery 
we also seek to meet market demands by providing students with the flexibility to take courses exclusively online or to combine online coursework with various campus and onsite options 
for example  based on market demand  particularly in connection with our nursing programs  we have established satellite locations at multiple hospitals that allow nursing students to take clinical courses onsite while completing other course work online 
we have established similar onsite arrangements with other major employers  including schools and school districts through which students can pursue student teaching opportunities 
this flexibility raises our profile among employers  encourages students to take and complete courses and eliminates inconveniences that tend to lessen student persistence 
small class size 
at december   of our online classes had or fewer students 
these class sizes provide each student with the opportunity to interact directly with course faculty and to receive individualized feedback and attention while also affording our faculty with the opportunity to engage proactively with a manageable number of students 
we believe this interaction enhances the academic quality of our programs by promoting opportunities for students to participate actively and thus build the requisite knowledge  competencies  and skills 
accreditation and program approvals we believe that the quality of our academic programs is evidenced by the college and program specific accreditations and approvals that we have pursued and obtained 
grand canyon university has been continually accredited by the higher learning commission and its predecessor since  obtaining its most recent ten year reaccreditation in we are licensed in arizona by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education

for example  for our nursing programs  we offer clinical courses onsite at hospitals and other healthcare centers with which we have relationships  and also arrange to allow these students to complete their clinical work onsite 
we refer to students attending a program with us through such relationships as professional studies students 
we currently offer our programs through three week semesters in a calendar year  with up to four starts available per semester for our online students  two starts available for our professional studies ground students and one start available per semester for our traditional ground students 
during each semester  classes may last for five  eight  or weeks 
depending on the program  students generally enroll in one to three courses per semester 
we generally require online students to complete two courses during a week semester  with each student concentrating on one course during each eight week period 
while there is no explicit requirement  we communicate to our online students our expectation that they access their online student classroom at least four times each week in order to maintain an active dialogue with their professors and classmates 
our online programs provide a digital record of student interactions for the course instructor to assess students levels of engagement and demonstration of required competencies 
new program development we typically identify a potential new degree program or emphasis area through market demand or from proposals developed by faculty  staff  students  alumni  or partners  and then perform an analysis of the development cost and the long term demand for the program 
if  following this analysis  we decide to proceed with the program  our curriculum design and development team designates a subject matter expert who works with other faculty and our curriculum development personnel to design a program that is consistent with our academically rigorous  career oriented program standards 
the program is then reviewed by the dean of the applicable college  the program standards and evaluation committee  academic affairs committee  our provost and chief academic officer  and finally  our president 
upon approval  the subject matter expert develops a course syllabus and our marketing department creates a marketing plan to publicize the new program 
our average program development process is six months from proposal to course introduction 
the development process is typically longer if we are expanding into a new field or offering a new level of degree 

table of contents assessment our office of assessment serves as our central resource for assessing and continually improving our curricula  student satisfaction and learning outcomes 
among other things  the assessment team reviews student course satisfaction surveys  analyzes archived student assignments to assess whether a given program is developing students foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and skills to achieve the expected learning outcomes  and provides feedback as to program effectiveness 
based on this data and the conclusions of the assessment team  we modify programs as necessary to meet our student satisfaction and educational development standards and make recommendations as to adding or modifying programs 
faculty our faculty includes full time  ground based faculty who teach under a nine month or twelve month teaching contract  as well as adjunct ground based faculty and online faculty who we employ to teach on a course by course basis for a specified fee 
as of december   we employed ground based faculty members  of which were full time and were part time adjuncts 
including our ground based faculty members  who are available to teach online courses  we maintain a pool of over  online faculty members  all of whom had completed our required training 
substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective field and of our faculty members hold a doctoral degree 
on occasion  we engage a limited number of faculty members who may not hold a graduate degree  but who evidence significant professional experience and achievement in their respective subject areas 
we believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success  particularly because faculty members have more interaction with our students than any other university employee 
accordingly  we regularly review the performance of our faculty  including  but not limited to  engaging our full time ground faculty and other specialists to conduct peer reviews of our online faculty  monitoring the amount of contact and the quality of feedback that faculty have with students in our online programs  reviewing student feedback  and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students 
if we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require  we work with the faculty member to improve performance  including  among other things  assigning him or her a mentor or through other means 
if the faculty member s performance does not improve  we terminate the faculty member s contract and employment 
student support services encouraging students that enter grand canyon university to complete their degree programs is critical to the success of our business

marketing  recruitment  and retention marketing 
we engage in a range of marketing activities designed to position us as a provider of academically rigorous  career oriented educational programs  build strong brand recognition in our core disciplines  differentiate us from other educational providers  raise awareness among prospective students  generate enrollment inquiries  and stimulate student and alumni referrals 
our online target market includes working adults focused on program quality  convenience  and career advancement goals 
our ground target market includes traditional college students  working adults seeking a high quality education in a traditional college setting  and working adults seeking to take classes with a cohort onsite at their employer s facility 
in marketing our programs to prospective students  we emphasize the value of the educational experience and the academic rigor and career orientation of the programs  rather than the cost or speed to graduation 
we believe this approach reinforces the qualities that we want associated with our brand and also attracts students who tend to be more persistent in starting and finishing their programs 
we have established dedicated teams  consisting of both marketing and enrollment personnel  at each of our colleges to lead our efforts to attract new students 
we believe that these blended groups  organized around each core discipline  promote more effective internal communication within our sales and marketing functions  allow deeper penetration within our target markets due to each team s singular focus on a core discipline  and enable us to gain a better understanding of the attributes of our students who ultimately enroll and graduate so that we can target our marketing and enrollment processes accordingly 
to generate student leads  our marketing and enrollment personnel employ an integrated marketing approach that utilizes a variety of lead sources to identify prospective students 
these lead generation sources include internet and affiliate advertising  which generates the majority of our leads and which includes purchasing leads from aggregators and also engaging in targeted  direct email advertising campaigns  and coordinated campaigns with various affiliates  search engine optimization techniques  through which we seek to obtain high placement in search engine results in response to key topic and word searches and drive traffic to our website  seminar and event marketing  in which our marketing and enrollment personnel host group events at various venues  including community colleges  corporations  and hospitals  referrals from existing students  alumni  and employees  a national accounts program that seeks to develop relationships with employers in our core disciplines  including healthcare providers  school districts  emergency services providers  and large corporations  that may be interested in providing dedicated and customized online and onsite educational opportunities to their employees  and to encourage senior executives to participate in executive training programs  and print and direct mail advertising campaigns  and other public relations and communications efforts  including promoting our athletic programs and student and alumni events 

table of contents recruitment 
once a prospective student has indicated an interest in enrolling in one of our programs  our lead management system identifies and directs an enrollment counselor to initiate immediate communication 
the enrollment counselor serves as the primary  direct contact for the prospective student and the counselor s goal is to help that individual gain sufficient knowledge and understanding of our programs so that he or she can assess whether there is a good match between our offerings and the prospective student s goals 
upon the prospective student s submission of an application  the enrollment counselor  together with our student services personnel  works with the applicant to gain acceptance  arrange financial aid  if needed  register for courses  and prepare for matriculation 
our enrollment counselors typically have prior education industry or sales experience 
each counselor undergoes a standardized three week training program that involves both classroom and supervisor monitored fieldwork and provides the counselor with training in financial aid  regulatory requirements  general sales skills  and our history and heritage  mission  and academic programs 
as of december   we employed over enrollment counselors at facilities in the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area 
retention 
a key component in retaining our students is providing an outstanding learning experience 
we feel that our team based  proactive approach to recruitment and enhanced student services results in increased retention due to our systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their enrollment  providing encouragement and highlighting their achievements 
our financial advisors proactively assist each student with the student s selection of an appropriate payment option  and monitors the student s progress and account balance to ensure a smooth financial aid experience and to help ensure our students are well prepared for their financial obligations incurred 
our academic advisors assist their students with their academic schedules and regularly monitor triggering events  such as the failure to participate in the classroom or failure to matriculate in a timely manner  which signal that a student may be at risk for dropping out 
upon identifying an at risk student  academic advisors proactively interact with the student to resolve any issues and encourage the student to continue with his or her program 
we have found that personally involving our employees in the student educational process  and proactively seeking to resolve issues before they become larger problems  can significantly increase retention rates among students 
these frequent interactions between financial and academic advisors and students are a key component to our retention strategy

this tuition and fees refund policy is different from  and applies in addition to  the return of title iv funds policy we are required to follow as a condition of our participation in the title iv programs 

table of contents sources of student financing our students finance their education through a combination of methods  as follows title iv programs 
the federal government provides for grants and loans to students under the title iv programs  and students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the department of education 
student financial aid under the title iv programs is primarily awarded on the basis of a student s financial need  which is generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount the student and the student s family can reasonably contribute to that cost 
all students receiving title iv program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study 
in addition  each school must ensure that title iv program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students 
during fiscal and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenue calculated on a cash basis in accordance with department of education standards that were in effect prior to the august reauthorization of the higher education act from tuition financed under the title iv programs 
the primary title iv programs that our students receive funding from are the federal family education loan  or ffel  program  federal direct loan program  or fdl program  and the federal pell grant  or pell  program  which are described below ffel 
under the ffel program  banks and other lending institutions make loans to students 
the ffel program includes the federal stafford loan program  the federal plus program which provides loans to graduate and professional studies students as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students  and the federal consolidation loan program 
if a student defaults on an ffel loan  payment to the lender is guaranteed by a federally recognized guaranty agency  which is then reimbursed by the department of education 
students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized stafford loan 
with a subsidized stafford loan  the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during grace periods and any approved periods of deferment  until the student s obligation to repay the loan begins 
unsubsidized stafford loans are not based on financial need  and are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized stafford loan or  in some cases  in addition to a subsidized stafford loan 
loan funds are disbursed to us  and we in turn disburse the amounts in excess of tuition and fees to students 
effective july   under the federal stafford loan program  a dependent undergraduate student can borrow up to  for the first academic year   for the second academic year  and  for each of the third and fourth academic years 
students classified as independent  and dependent students whose parents were denied a parent loan for undergraduate students  can obtain up to an additional  for each of the first and second academic years and an additional  for each of the third and fourth academic years 
students enrolled in graduate programs can borrow up to  per academic year 
students enrolled in certain graduate level health programs can receive an additional  per academic year 
fdl program 
in addition to ffel loans made by private lenders  the department of education also administers the fdl program  which eliminated the private financial institution as the lender 
under the fdl program  the federal government makes the loans directly to the students with terms consistent with ffel loans 
the types of loans  the maximum annual loan amounts and other terms of the loans made under the fdl program are similar to those for loans made under the ffel program 
during fiscal year  we began participating in the fdl program for a portion of our title iv eligible students 
in us president barack obama s budget request delivered to congress on february   the department of education proposed to eliminate ffel loans and instead require all title iv student loans to be administered through the fdl program commencing july  we expect to be able to fully transition from the ffel program to the fdl program by september 
table of contents pell 
under the pell program  the department of education makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need 
effective july   the maximum annual grant a student can receive under the pell program is  and effective july   the maximum annual amount increased to  under the august reauthorization of the higher education act  students are able for the first time to receive pell grant funds for attendance on a year round basis  which means that the amount a student can receive in a given year is more than the traditionally defined maximum annual amount 
our students also receive funding under other title iv programs  including the federal perkins loan program  the federal supplemental educational opportunity grant program  the federal work study program  the national science and mathematics access to retain talent grant program  the academic competitiveness grant program  and the teacher education assistance for college and higher education grant program 
other financial aid programs 
in addition to the title iv programs listed above  eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental sources 
these include veterans educational benefits administered by the us department of veterans affairs and state financial aid programs 
during fiscal and  we derived an immaterial amount of our net revenue from tuition financed by such programs 
private loans 
some of our students also use private loan programs to help finance their education 
students can apply to a number of different lenders for private loans at current market interest rates 
private loans are intended to fund a portion of students cost of education not covered by the title iv programs and other financial aid 
during fiscal and  payments derived from private loans constituted approximately and  respectively  of our cash revenue 
third party lenders independently determine whether a loan to a student is classified as subprime  and  based on these determinations  we did not derive any payments from subprime loans during fiscal year or other sources 
we derived the remainder of our net revenue from tuition that is self funded or attributable to employer tuition reimbursements 
technology systems and management we believe that we have established a secure  reliable  scalable technology system that provides a high quality online educational environment and gives us the capability to substantially grow our online programs and enrollment 
online course delivery and management 
our online learning management system is the angel learning management suite  which is a web based system and collaboration portal that stores  manages  and delivers course content  provides interactive communication between students and faculty  enables assignment uploading  and supplies online evaluation tools 
the system also provides centralized administration features that support the implementation of policies for content format and in classroom learning tools 
we continually seek to develop and implement features that enhance the online classroom experience  such as delivering course content through streaming video  simulations  and other interactive enhancements 
internal administration 
we utilize a commercial customer relations management package to distribute  manage  track  and report on all prospective student leads developed  both internally and externally 
this package is scalable to capacity levels well in excess of current requirements 
we also utilize a commercial software package to track title iv funds  student records  grades  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
this back office system was designed to manage campus based traditional students 
we plan to transition our online programs from a term based financial aid system to a borrower based financial aid system  that will allow us to manage both traditional and non traditional students 
as part of this transition  we are converting our back office system from datatel  inc to a series of programs developed by campus management corp  including campusvue and campusportal  and also implementing microsoft s great plains accounting system 
we anticipate going live in our new systems in the second quarter of 
table of contents infrastructure 
we operate two data centers  one at our campus and one at a third party co location facility 
all of our servers are networked and we have redundant data backup 
we manage our technology environment internally 
our wide area network uses multi protocol label switching technology for maximum availability and flexibility 
student access is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers and is load balanced for maximum performance 
real time monitoring provides current system status across server  network  and storage components 
ground campus we own our ground campus  which is located on approximately acres in the center of the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area  near downtown phoenix 
our campus facilities currently consist of buildings with more than  square feet of space  which include classrooms  three lecture halls  a seat theater  three student computer labs with computers that are available to students hours per day  a  volume physical library  and a media arts complex that provides communications students with audio and video equipment 
we house our ground students in on campus student apartments and dormitories that can collectively hold up to students 
we have athletic teams that compete in division ii of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa 
our athletic facilities include two gymnasiums  which accommodate basketball  volleyball  and wrestling  as well as facilities for our baseball  softball  tennis  lacrosse  and swimming programs 
our baseball program has produced more than twenty major league baseball players 
baseball  basketball  tennis and soccer have combined to produce nine national association of intercollegiate athletics naia or ncaa national championship teams 
we believe our ground based programs and traditional campus not only offers our ground students  faculty  and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience  but also provides our online students  faculty  and staff with a sense of connection to a traditional university 
additionally  our full time ground faculty play an important role in integrating online faculty into our academic programs and ensuring the overall consistency and quality of the ground and online student experience 
we believe our mix of a rapidly growing online program  anchored by a traditional ground based program with a year history and heritage  differentiates us from most other for profit postsecondary education providers 
we intend to expand the size and enhance the profile and reputation of our ground campus by  among other things  adding faculty and expanding upon and modernizing our campus infrastructure and technological capabilities over the next several years 
these activities may require significant capital expenditures and may cause us to incur significant expenses 
in anticipation of this growth we recently completed the acquisition of acres of land adjacent to our campus for million and began the construction of an additional dormitory  classroom building and a student recreation facility 
employees in addition to our faculty  as of december   we employed  staff and administrative personnel in university services  academic advising and academic support  enrollment services  university administration  financial aid  information technology  human resources  corporate accounting  finance  and other administrative functions 
none of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 
competition there are more than  us colleges and universities serving traditional and adult students 
competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography  program offerings  modality  ownership  quality level  and selectivity of admissions 
no one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market 
our ground program competes with arizona state university  northern arizona university  and the university of arizona  the in state public universities  as well as two year colleges within the state community college system 
to a limited extent  our ground program also competes with geographically proximate universities with similar religious heritages  including azusa pacific university  baylor university  and seattle pacific university 
our online programs compete with local  traditional universities geographically located near each of our prospective students  and with other for profit postsecondary schools that offer online degrees  particularly those schools that offer online graduate programs within our core disciplines  including capella university  university of phoenix  and walden university 
in addition  many public and private schools  colleges  and universities  including most major colleges and universities  offer online programs 

table of contents non profit institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  non profit institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students 
we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs 
we believe that the competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include availability of career oriented and accredited program offerings  the types of degrees offered and marketability of those degrees  reputation  regulatory approvals  and compliance history of the school  convenient  flexible and dependable access to programs and classes  qualified and experienced faculty  level of student support services  cost of the program  marketing and selling effectiveness  and the time necessary to earn a degree

table of contents regulation we are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the federal government through the department of education under the higher education act 
the regulations  standards  and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and financial condition 
as an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates  we are required to be authorized by appropriate state education authorities 
in addition  in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  we must be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting commission and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation by the department of education due to our participation in the federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act 
those title iv programs include educational loans with below market interest rates that are guaranteed by the federal government in the event of a student s default on repaying the loan  as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need 
to participate in the title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agency or agencies  be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education  and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
our business activities are planned and implemented to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies 
we employ a vice president of sfa compliance who is knowledgeable about regulatory matters relevant to student financial aid programs and our chief financial officer  chief risk officer  and general counsel also provide oversight designed to ensure that we meet the requirements of our regulated operating environment 
state education licensure and regulation we are authorized to offer our educational programs by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the regulatory agency governing private postsecondary educational institutions in the state of arizona  where we are located 
we do not presently have campuses in any states other than arizona 
we are required by the higher education act to maintain authorization from the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to participate in the title iv programs 
this authorization is very important to us and our business 
to maintain our state authorization  we must continuously meet standards relating to  among other things  educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  marketing and recruitment  financial operations  addition of new locations and educational programs  and various operational and administrative procedures 
failure to comply with the requirements of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could result in us losing our authorization to offer our educational programs  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and which could force us to cease operations 
alternatively  the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could restrict our ability to offer certain degree and non degree programs 
most other states impose regulatory requirements on out of state educational institutions operating within their boundaries  such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state 
state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and other operational matters  some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the department of education or the arizona state board for private postsecondary education 
laws in some states limit schools ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states 
some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  and many require the posting of surety bonds 

table of contents in addition  several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state  such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state  employing faculty who reside in the state  or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state 
state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states  and can change frequently 
new laws  regulations  or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states  which could  in turn  negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state education agency in those states and we have obtained such licensure 
in other states  we have obtained approvals as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities or where we have determined that our licensure or authorization can facilitate the teaching certification process in a particular state for graduates of our college of education 
we review the licensure requirements of other states when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies 
because state regulatory requirements  including agency interpretations  can change frequently  and because we enroll students in all states and the district of columbia  we expect that state regulatory authorities in states where we are not currently licensed or authorized will request that we seek licensure or authorization in their states in the future 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with additional state licensing or authorization requirements that may arise or be asserted in the future  if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state  or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required  we could lose our state licensure or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in that state  fines  and penalties 
while we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized  other than arizona  are individually material to our operations  the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments 
state professional licensure many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields  including fields such as education and healthcare 
these requirements vary by state and by field 
a student s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors  including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate  as well as the following factors  among others whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure  or by a professional association  whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state  whether the institution and the program are accredited and  if so  by what accrediting commissions  and whether the institution s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work 
many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields  such as teaching and nursing 
many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state 
our college of education is approved by the arizona state board of education to offer institutional recommendations credentials for the certification of elementary  secondary  and special education teachers and school administrators 
our college of nursing and health services is approved by the arizona state board of nursing for the bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degrees 
due to varying requirements for professional licensure in each state  we inform students of the risks associated with obtaining professional licensure and that it is each student s responsibility to determine what state  local  or professional licensure and certification requirements are necessary in his or her individual state 

table of contents accreditation we have been continuously accredited since by the higher learning commission and its predecessor  each a regional accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
our accreditation was reaffirmed in  and the next scheduled comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in accreditation is a private  non governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance  governance  integrity  educational quality  faculty  physical resources  administrative capability and resources  and financial stability 
to be recognized by the department of education  accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions  conduct peer review evaluations of institutions  and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria 
an accredited school is subject to periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance  integrity and quality required for accreditation 
there are six regional accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education  each with a specified geographic scope of coverage  which together cover the entire united states 
most traditional  public and private non profit  degree granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these six regional accrediting commissions 
the higher learning commission  which accredits grand canyon university  is the same regional accrediting commission that accredits such universities as the university of arizona  arizona state university  and other degree granting public and private colleges and universities in the states of arizona  arkansas  colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  south dakota  west virginia  wisconsin  and wyoming 
accreditation by the higher learning commission is important to us for several reasons  including the fact that it enables our students to receive title iv financial aid 
other colleges and universities depend  in part  on an institution s accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of the higher learning commission  we could lose our accreditation by that agency  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in  and final regulations issued by the department of education  effective july   require accreditors to monitor the growth of programs at institutions that are experiencing significant enrollment growth 
the higher learning commission requires all affiliated institutions to complete an annual data report 
if the non financial data  particularly enrollment information  and any other information submitted by the institution indicate problems  rapid change  or significant growth  the higher learning commission staff may require that the institution address any concerns arising from the data report in the next self study and visit process 
the higher learning commission staff may also recommend that its institutional actions council require additional monitoring 
in addition  the department of education has issued final regulations  which will take effect on july   that require the higher learning commission to notify the department of education if an institution it accredits that offers distance learning programs experiences an increase in its headcount enrollment of or more in any fiscal year  which could include us based on our historical enrollment growth rates  and the department of education may consider that information in connection with its own regulatory oversight activities 
in addition to institutional accreditation by the higher learning commission  there are numerous specialized accrediting commissions that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction  many of which are in healthcare and professional fields 
accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting commissions signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies 
in addition to being accredited by the higher learning commission  we also have the following specialized accreditations the association of collegiate business schools and programs accredits our executive master of business administration degree program  master of business administration degree program and our bachelor of science degree programs in accounting  business administration  marketing  and entrepreneurship  
table of contents the commission on collegiate nursing education accredits our bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degree programs  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education accredits our athletic training program 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting commissions  we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs  which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs as well as student inability to seek licensure 
regulation of federal student financial aid programs to be eligible to participate in the title iv programs  an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the higher education act and the regulations issued thereunder by the department of education 
an institution must  among other things  be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located in our case  arizona and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education in our case  the higher learning commission 
we submitted our application for recertification to participate in the title iv programs to the department of education in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june   and therefore our participation in the title iv programs has been automatically extended on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the title iv programs  the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs  and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for profit educational institutions have caused congress to require the department of education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for profit educational institutions 
as a result  our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review 
because the department of education periodically revises its regulations as it did in in connection with the august reauthorization of the higher education act described below and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations  we cannot predict with certainty how the title iv program requirements will be applied in all circumstances 
significant factors relating to the title iv programs that could adversely affect us include the following congressional action 
congress must reauthorize the higher education act on a periodic basis  usually every five to six years  and the most recent reauthorization occurred in august the reauthorized higher education act reauthorized all of the title iv programs in which we participate  but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the title iv programs  including provisions relating to the relationships between institutions and lenders that make student loans  student loan default rates  and the formula for revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the title iv programs 
in addition  in congress enacted legislation that reduces interest rates on certain title iv loans and government subsidies to lenders that participate in the title iv programs  which caused reduced liquidity in capital markets and  therefore  the potential to reduce access to title iv program loans by students and parents 
in may  congress enacted additional legislation to attempt to ensure that all eligible students will be able to obtain title iv loans in the future  and that a sufficient number of lenders will continue to provide title iv loans 
additional legislation is also pending in congress  including legislation which  among other things  would eliminate the federally guaranteed student loan program and require all future student loans to be made through the fdl program 
we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any of the pending legislation will be enacted 
although we are approved to participate in the fdl program  because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the title iv programs  any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or our ability or the ability of our students to participate in the title iv programs could increase our costs of compliance  reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our institution  require us to seek to arrange for other sources of financial aid for our students and materially decrease our student enrollment 
in addition  a transition to the fdl program could cause disruptions in the administration of title iv program loans to our students if we or the department of education encounter difficulties with the systems or processes necessary for increased fdl program loans 
however  we have already started participating in the fdl program and have experienced no difficulties thus far in processing loans 

table of contents in addition  congress must determine the funding levels for the title iv programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process  and may adjust those levels at other times 
a reduction in federal funding levels for the title iv programs could reduce the ability of some of our students to finance their education 
the loss of or a significant reduction in title iv program funds available to our students could reduce our enrollments and revenue 
pending regulatory changes 
in connection with the reauthorization of the higher education act  congress directed the department of education to promulgate regulations to clarify and carry out the numerous revisions made in such reauthorization 
in december  the department of education established five negotiated rulemaking committees to begin to work on developing such regulations 
negotiated rulemaking is a process whereby the department of education consults with members of the postsecondary education community to identify issues of concern and attempts to agree on proposed regulatory revisions to address those issues before the department of education formally proposes any regulations 
if the department of education and negotiators cannot reach consensus on their entire package of draft regulations  the department of education is authorized to propose regulations without being bound by any agreements made in the negotiation process 
the five original negotiated rulemaking committees have completed work on certain regulation packages and final regulations were issued in october of  which will become effective on july  in may  the department of education announced its intent to initiate another round of negotiated rulemaking to address regulations to improve the administration of the title iv programs 
that process was concluded for a significant number of regulatory topics in january of and addressed a number of significant issues  including compensation paid by institutions to persons or entities engaged in student recruiting or admission activities  the determination of satisfactory academic progress under different academic calendars  state authorization as a component of institutional eligibility  the definition of a credit hour for purposes of determining program eligibility status  particularly in the context of awarding pell grants  verification of information included on student aid applications  the definition of a high school diploma as a condition of a student s receipt of title iv aid and requirements that an institution be able to demonstrate that its graduates obtain gainful employment  as measured against certain metrics such as student loan debt and salaries of graduates 
the negotiators did not reach consensus on many of the issues up for discussion in this round of negotiated rulemaking 
of the proposed revisions to the regulations being considered in this negotiated rulemaking  the issues related to gainful employment and incentive compensation are of particular concern to for profit educational institutions 
the negotiators did not reach consensus on either of these issues  leaving many significant concerns of industry negotiators open and unresolved 
as such  the department of education is authorized to propose regulations with respect to these topics without regard to the concerns of institutions as expressed during the negotiated rulemaking process 
following the conclusion of this round of negotiated rulemaking  possibly in the spring or summer of  the department of education is expected to issue proposed regulations for public comment and to issue final regulations by november   which is the required deadline in order for such regulations to take effect on july  we are still assessing the impact of the final regulations issued in october of and the possible impact of the ongoing negotiated rulemaking on our financial aid policies and other plans and strategies 
to the extent certain of these revisions to the regulations are adopted as proposed by the department of education  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to comply with such new requirements or whether compliance with such new requirements will result in a material adverse effect on our enrollments and operations 
in may  the department of education announced that it was initiating a further negotiated rulemaking process to revise its regulations in certain areas  including the regulations related to incentive compensation and gainful employment 
as part of the current negotiated rulemaking process  the potential elimination or curtailment of the incentive compensation safe harbors is being considered  leaving open the possibility that this rule will be administered on an even stricter basis 
eligibility and certification procedures 
each institution must apply periodically to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs 
such recertification generally is required every six years  but may be required earlier  including when an institution undergoes a change in control 
an institution may also come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances  such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the school s program participation agreement with the department of education 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 

table of contents since may we have been certified to participate in title iv programs on a provisional basis 
we submitted our application for recertification in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june   and therefore our provisional certification to participate in the title iv programs has been automatically extended on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
since june  we have filed updates with the department of education and communicated with department of education personnel in order to update our pending recertification application with relevant information  such as our status as a publicly traded corporation and the identity of the members of our board of directors 
based on our provisional certification  the department of education may more closely review any application we may file for recertification  new locations  new educational programs  acquisitions of other schools  or other significant changes 
for a school that is certified on a provisional basis  the department of education may revoke the institution s certification without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
for a school that is provisionally certified on a month to month basis  the department of education may allow the institution s certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice  and without any formal procedure for review of such action 
to our knowledge  such action is very rare and has only occurred upon a determination that an institution is in substantial violation of material title iv requirements 
for the foreseeable future  we do not have plans to initiate new educational programs  acquire other schools  or make other significant changes in our operations that would require approval of the department of education 
accordingly  we do not believe that our continued provisional certification on a month to month basis has had or will have any material impact on our day to day operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us while the investigation by the office of inspector general of the department of education is being conducted  while the qui tam lawsuit is pending  or at all  or that it will not impose restrictions as a condition of approving our pending recertification application or with respect to any future recertification 
if the department of education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in the title iv programs at any time  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds 
similarly  the department of education could renew our certification  but restrict or delay our students receipt of title iv funds  limit the number of students to whom we could disburse such funds  or place other restrictions on us that could be similar to  or more or less restrictive than  the restrictions that the department of education imposed on us in connection with our recertification in any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments and us 
administrative capability 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in the title iv programs 
to meet the administrative capability standards  an institution must  among other things comply with all applicable title iv program requirements  have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the title iv programs  have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels  have various procedures in place for awarding  disbursing and safeguarding title iv funds and for maintaining required records  
table of contents administer the title iv programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls  not be  and not have any principal or affiliate who is  debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension  provide financial aid counseling to its students  refer to the department of education s office of inspector general any credible information indicating that any student  parent  employee  third party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the title iv programs  submit all required reports and financial statements in a timely manner  and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the department of education may require the institution to repay title iv funds its students previously received  transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of title iv funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the institution s participation in the title iv programs 
the department of education published final regulations revising the administrative capability regulations 
these revisions include provisions related to i reporting to the department of education any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a lender to institutional employees with loan or other financial aid responsibilities and ii implementation of the new three year cohort default rate rules and will be effective on july  we will have to make certain administrative and reporting changes to adapt our systems and practices to meet the requirements of these new regulations when they take effect  and we are still assessing the other potential impacts  if any  of these new regulations on our business 
in addition  as part of our transition from a term based financial aid system where all students  including online students  begin programs and are eligible to receive financial aid at periodic start dates pursuant to a calendar based term system to a borrower based financial aid system where each student may begin a program and be eligible to receive financial aid at any time throughout the year  we are converting our back office system from datatel  inc to a series of programs developed by campus management corp  including campusvue and campusportal 
effective spring  when we move to the borrower based academic year bbay non term processing  gcu will no longer be offering courses in the modular format 
this conversion is intended to allow us to manage our non traditional online students with greater ease and flexibility by providing for rolling and flexible start dates 
if we do not effectively implement this system or if the system does not operate as intended  it could affect our ability to comply with the department of education s administrative capability requirements 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  our students could lose  or be limited in their access to  title iv program funding 

table of contents financial responsibility 
the higher education act and department of education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as grand canyon university must satisfy in order to participate in the title iv programs 
the department of education evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis  based on the institution s annual audited financial statements  as well as when the institution applies to the department of education to have its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs recertified 
the most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution s composite score  which is derived from a formula established by the department of education based on three financial ratios equity ratio  which measures the institution s capital resources  financial viability and ability to borrow  primary reserve ratio  which measures the institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and net income ratio  which measures the institution s ability to operate at a profit or within its means 
the department of education assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative to positive  with negative reflecting financial weakness and positive reflecting financial strength 
the department of education then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution 
the composite score for the institution s most recent fiscal year must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further department of education oversight 
in addition to having an acceptable composite score  an institution must  among other things  provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title iv program requirements  meet all of its financial obligations including required refunds to students and any title iv liabilities and debts  be current in its debt payments  and not receive an adverse  qualified  or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements 
when we were recertified by the department of education in to continue participating in the title iv programs  the department of education advised us that we did not satisfy its standards of financial responsibility  based on our fiscal year financial statements  as submitted to the department of education 
as a result of this and other concerns about our administrative capability  the department of education required us to post a letter of credit  accept restrictions on the growth of our program offerings and enrollment  and receive title iv funds under the heightened cash monitoring system of payment rather than by advance payment 
in october  the department of education eliminated the letter of credit requirement and allowed the growth restrictions to expire  based upon its review of our fiscal year financial statements 
we have subsequently submitted our fiscal year   and financial statements to the department of education as required  and we calculated that our composite score for each such fiscal year exceeded we therefore believe that we meet the department of education s financial responsibility standards for our most recently completed fiscal year 
we have not submitted our financial statements to the department of education for our most recently completed fiscal year but we have calculated that our composite score for fiscal year will also exceed if the department of education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors  we would expect to be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the department of education  which could include  in the department s discretion  posting a letter of credit  accepting provisional certification  complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements  agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance funding arrangement  such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring  and complying with or accepting other limitations on our ability to increase the number of programs we offer or the number of students we enroll 
the requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions imposed by the department of education could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our cash flows 
if we are unable to meet the minimum composite score or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility  and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility  our students could lose their access to title iv program funding 

table of contents return of title iv funds for students who withdraw 
when a student who has received title iv program funds withdraws from school  the institution must determine the amount of title iv program funds the student has earned 
in a term based environment  which is what we currently operate in  the return to title iv is calculated based on completed days in the term as a percentage of the total days in the term 
the exception to this rule is that if courses are offered in a modular setting  and a student has completed the first module  no return to title iv calculation needs to be done 
our terms consist primarily of two eight week courses 
so if a student completed the first eight week course  no return to title iv calculation is required 
we are moving from a term based environment to a borrower based non term environment starting in april in a borrower based environment  if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment or payment period  the amount of title iv program funds that the student has earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds the student received or for which the student would otherwise be eligible 
if the student withdraws after the threshold  then the student is deemed to have earned of the title iv program funds he or she received 
based on the change to a non term environment  we anticipate an increase in the title iv program funds to be returned to lenders or the department of education 
the institution must return the unearned title iv program funds to the appropriate lender or the department of education in a timely manner  which is generally no later than days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew 
if such payments are not timely made  the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the department of education equal to of the title iv funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year 
under department of education regulations  the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of title iv program funds for or more of the withdrawn students in the audit sample in the institution s annual title iv compliance audit for either of the institution s two most recent fiscal years or in a department of education program review 
we did not exceed this threshold in our annual title iv compliance audit in our   or fiscal years 
the rule 
a requirement of the higher education act  commonly referred to as the rule  that is applicable only to for profit  postsecondary educational institutions like us  provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  if  under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenue  the institution derives more than of its revenues for each of two consecutive fiscal years from title iv program funds 
this rule provides that an institution that violates this revenue limit becomes ineligible to participate in the title iv programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeds the threshold  and its period of ineligibility extends for at least two consecutive fiscal years 
if an institution exceeds the threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and it and its students have received title iv funds during the period of ineligibility  the institution will be required to return those funds to the applicable lender or the department of education 
if an institution s rate exceeds for any single fiscal year  it will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years 
the august reauthorization of the higher education act included significant revisions to the rule that became effective upon the date of the law s enactment 
recent changes in federal law that increased title iv grant and loan limits  and any additional increases in the future  may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from the title iv programs  which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy the rule 
in addition  economic downturns that adversely affect the employment circumstances of our students or their parents  or that reduce the availability of private loans for our students  could also increase their reliance on title iv programs 
however  such effects may be mitigated by other provisions of the higher education act reauthorization that allow institutions  when calculating their compliance with this revenue test  to exclude from their title iv program revenues for a three year period the additional federal student loan amounts that became available through the unsubsidized stafford loan program starting in july  and to include more non title iv revenues  such as revenues from institutional loans under certain circumstances 
given the level of complexity of such a calculation we are unable to quantify precisely the benefit that we would derive in the percentage from these revisions 
as such  our reported rates below exclude the benefits from the recent revisions 
using the department of education s formula under the rule that was in effect prior to the august reauthorization of the higher education act  for our and fiscal years  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis from title iv program funds 
these rates have been reviewed by our financial accounting firm as reflected in the notes to our audited financial statements for each fiscal year 
however  as a result of recent changes in federal law that increased title iv grant and loan limits  as well as the current economic downturn  which has adversely affected the employment circumstances of our students and their parents and increased their reliance on title iv programs  we expect the percentage of our revenue that we receive from the title iv programs to continue to increase in the future  making it more difficult for us to satisfy this requirement 
exceeding the threshold such that we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents student loan defaults 
under the higher education act  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their ffel student loans or federal direct loans exceed certain levels 
for each federal fiscal year  the department of education calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution known as a cohort default rate 
an institution s cohort default rate for a federal fiscal year historically has been calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the following federal fiscal year the two year method 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in extended the measurement period for cohort default rates so that the rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second following federal fiscal year the three year method  which is expected to increase cohort default rates for most if not all institutions 
in december  the department of education issued trial cohort default rates that were calculated for federal fiscal years  and as if the extended period to count student defaults already applied to those prior years 
the department of education stated that it released this data for informational purposes only  to assist institutions in anticipating how the extended period to count student defaults might affect their future cohort default rates when that extended period is actually implemented 
based on the department of education s release of this information  our default rates for these prior years increased  as set forth below 
while the trial cohort default rates are informative for prior periods  they do not enable us to predict or estimate with any degree of certainty the extent of the expected increase in our ffel cohort default rates for future federal fiscal years when the new extended period to measure student defaults is put into effect  or whether any such increase will affect our participation in the title iv programs 
the department of education has issued a final regulation indicating that it will begin to implement this extended measurement period for the cohort default rates that will be calculated for loans that enter repayment in federal fiscal year  which is the year that ended on september  the department of education has proposed a transition period of three years during which it will calculate two cohort default rates for each institution for each of federal fiscal years  and  with one such rate measured under the two year method and the other such rate measured under the three year method 
the cohort default rates for federal fiscal year  and  as calculated under the new three year method  are not expected to be published until calendar years  and the department of education will apply different legal thresholds to measure an institution s compliance under each set of rates 
if the department of education notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceed  as calculated under the two year method  for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years  or exceed  as calculated under the three year method  for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years  the institution s participation in the ffel program  the fdl program and the pell program ends days after that notification  unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
in addition  an institution s participation in the ffel program and the fdl program ends days after notification by the department of education that its most recent cohort default rate  as calculated under either the two year method or the three year method  is greater than  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
an institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification and for the next two fiscal years 
if an institution s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds under the two year method  or under the three year method  the department of education may place the institution on provisional certification status 
our cohort default rates on ffel program loans for the  and federal fiscal years  the three most recent years for which such rates have been calculated  were  and  respectively 
our trial cohort default rates for these years  as issued by the department of education in december  were  and  respectively 
our draft cohort default rate for the federal fiscal year is 
in the fall of  our students began applying for loans under the fdl program 
when these loans are disbursed  they will be combined with our students ffel loans in calculating our annual student loan cohort default rate 
in such case  the potential sanctions discussed in this section would be based on the combined cohort default rate 

table of contents incentive compensation rule 
an institution that participates in the title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding activity 
the department of education s regulations set forth safe harbors which describe payments and arrangements that do not violate the incentive compensation rule 
the department of education s regulations make clear that the safe harbors are not a complete list of permissible practices under this law 
for example  one of these safe harbors permits adjustments to fixed salary for enrollment personnel provided that such adjustments are not made more than twice during any twelve month period  and that any adjustment is not based solely on the number of students recruited  admitted  enrolled  or awarded financial aid  but the regulations do not address other practices  such as the provision of non cash awards to enrollment personnel 
the restrictions of the incentive compensation rule also extend to any third party companies that an educational institution contracts with for student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding services 
since  we have engaged mind streams  llc to assist us with student recruitment activities 
in recent years  several for profit education companies have been faced with whistleblower lawsuits  known as qui tam cases  brought by current or former employees alleging that their institution had made impermissible incentive payments 
a qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals a relator on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment 
the relator  often a current or former employee  is entitled to a share of the government s recovery in the case 
a qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case 
if the government intervenes  it takes over primary control of the litigation 
if the government declines to intervene in the case  the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government 
on september   we were served with a qui tam lawsuit that had been filed against us in august  in the united states district court for the district of arizona by a then current employee on behalf of the federal government 
all proceedings in the lawsuit had been under seal until september   when the court unsealed the first amended complaint  which had been filed on august  the qui tam lawsuit alleges  among other things  that we violated the false claims act by knowingly making false statements  and submitting false records or statements  from at least to the present  to get false or fraudulent claims paid or approved  and asserts that we have improperly compensated certain of our enrollment counselors in violation of the title iv law governing compensation of such employees  and as a result  improperly received title iv program funds 
the complaint specifically alleges that some of our compensation practices with respect to our enrollment personnel  including providing non cash awards  have violated the title iv law governing compensation 
while we believe that our compensation policies and practices at issue in the complaint have not been based on success in enrolling students in violation of applicable law  the department of education s regulations and interpretations of the incentive compensation law do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances and some of our practices  including in respect of non cash awards  have not been within the scope of any specific safe harbor provided in the compensation regulations 
the complaint seeks treble the amount of unspecified damages sustained by the federal government in connection with our receipt of title iv funding  a civil penalty for each violation of the false claims act  attorneys fees  costs  and interest 
we filed a motion to dismiss this case in november  which was denied by the court in february pursuant to the court s mandatory scheduling order  we have entered into settlement discussions with respect to the qui tam matter with the relator 
in connection with such discussions  we have reached a settlement in principle with the relator pursuant to which we have agreed to pay million to finally resolve the qui tam case and thereby avoid the cost and distraction of a potentially protracted trial 
we have accrued that amount in the accompanying financial statements for the year ended december  this settlement is conditioned upon obtaining the approval of the us department of justice which has authority to approve settlements of false claims act matters and the department of education with respect to the resolution of the oig investigation  and finalizing settlement terms that would release us from other false claims act cases based upon the conduct covered by the settlement 
the parties and the united states government are continuing to negotiate towards a final settlement 
the ultimate dismissal of the action  should a final settlement be reached  is subject to the court s approval 
should the parties fail to conclude the settlement on the proposed or other terms  we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit 

table of contents the office of inspector general of the department of education is responsible for  among other things  promoting the effectiveness and integrity of the department of education s programs and operations  including compliance with applicable statutes and regulations 
the office of inspector general performs investigations of alleged violations of law  including cases of alleged fraud and abuse  or other identified vulnerabilities  in programs administered or financed by the department of education  including matters related to the incentive compensation rule 
on august   the office of inspector general served an administrative subpoena on grand canyon university requiring us to provide certain records and information related to performance reviews and salary adjustments for all of our enrollment counselors and managers from january  to the present 
the office of inspector general s investigation is focused on whether we have compensated any of our enrollment counselors or managers in a manner that violated the title iv statutory requirements or the related department of education regulations concerning the payment of incentive compensation based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid 
we have been cooperating with the office of inspector general to facilitate its investigation and have completed production of all requested documents 
see item a  risk factors the office of inspector general of the department of education has commenced an investigation of grand canyon university  which is ongoing and which may result in fines  penalties  other sanctions  and damage to our reputation in the industry 
any fine or other sanction resulting from the office of inspector general investigation or otherwise  or any monetary liability resulting from the qui tam action  could damage our reputation and impose significant costs on us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 
we cannot presently predict the ultimate outcome of the qui tam lawsuit or the office of inspector general investigation or any liability or other sanctions that might result 
in may  the department of education announced that it was initiating a further negotiated rulemaking process to revise its regulations in certain areas  including the regulations implementing the incentive compensation rule 
as part of the current negotiated rulemaking process  the potential elimination or curtailment of the incentive compensation safe harbors is being considered  leaving open the possibility that this rule will be administered on an even stricter basis 
following the conclusion of this round of negotiated rulemaking  possibly in the spring or summer of  the department of education is expected to issue proposed regulations for public comment and to issue final regulations by november   which is the required deadline in order for such regulations to take effect on july  compliance reviews 
we are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies  including the department of education  its office of inspector general  state licensing agencies  agencies that guarantee ffel loans  the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans  and accrediting commissions 
as part of the department of education s ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of the title iv programs  the higher education act also requires institutions to annually submit to the department of education a title iv compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and department of education audit standards 
in addition  to enable the department of education to make a determination of an institution s financial responsibility  each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with department of education regulations 
privacy of student records 
the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa  and the department of education s ferpa regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students educational records by limiting an institution s disclosure of a student s personally identifiable information without the student s prior written consent 
ferpa also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution  to notify students at least annually of this inspection right  and to maintain records in each student s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information 
if an institution fails to comply with ferpa  the department of education may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution s receipt of further federal funds 
in addition  educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act  or glba  a federal law designed to protect consumers personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers 
glba and the applicable glba regulations require an institution to  among other things  develop and maintain a comprehensive  written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students  parents  or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship 
if an institution fails to comply with the applicable glba requirements  it may be required to take corrective actions  be subject to monitoring and oversight by the ftc  and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the ftc 
for profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the ftc with respect to their collection  use  and disclosure of student information 
the institution must also comply with the ftc red flags rule  a section of the federal fair credit reporting act  that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts 

table of contents potential effect of regulatory violations 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing the title iv programs  the department of education could impose one or more sanctions  including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment  requiring us to repay title iv program funds  requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education as a condition for continued title iv certification  taking emergency action against us  initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  suspend  or terminate our participation in the title iv programs  or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution 
since we are provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis  the department of education could allow our certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice and without any formal procedure for review of such action 
in addition  the agencies that guarantee ffel loans for our students could initiate proceedings to limit  suspend  or terminate our eligibility to provide ffel loans in the event of certain regulatory violations 
if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment or termination of our participation in the title iv programs  our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or if the amount of available title iv program funds was reduced  we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students 
we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to our students  but there is no assurance that this would be the case 
the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid would likely not be as favorable as those for title iv program funds  and we might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing such alternative assistance 
it is unlikely that we would be able to arrange alternative funding on any terms to replace all the title iv funding our students receive 
accordingly  our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or a reduction in the amount of available title iv program funding for our students  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid 
in addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in the title iv programs  we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies  but also by other government agencies and third parties  such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public 
uncertainties  increased oversight  and changes in student loan environment 
since  student loan programs  including the title iv programs  have come under increased scrutiny by the department of education  congress  state attorneys general  and other parties 
issues that have received extensive attention include allegations of conflicts of interest between some institutions and lenders that provide title iv loans  questionable incentives given by lenders to some schools and school employees  allegations of deceptive practices in the marketing of student loans  and schools leading students to use certain lenders 
several institutions and lenders have been cited for these problems and have paid several million dollars in the aggregate to settle those claims 
the practices of numerous other schools and lenders are being examined by government agencies at the federal and state level 
as a result of the increased scrutiny of student loan programs  congress has passed new laws  the department of education has enacted stricter regulations  and several states have adopted codes of conduct or enacted state laws that further regulate the conduct of lenders  schools  and school personnel 
these new laws and regulations  among other things  limit schools relationships with lenders  restrict the types of services that schools may receive from lenders  prohibit lenders from providing other types of funding to schools in exchange for title iv loan volume  require schools to provide additional information to students concerning institutionally preferred lenders  and significantly reduce the amount of federal payments to lenders who participate in the title iv loan programs 
in addition  recent adverse market conditions for consumer loans in general have adversely affected the student lending marketplace 

table of contents the cumulative impact of these developments and conditions has caused some lenders to cease providing title iv loans to students  including some lenders that previously provided title iv loans to our students 
other lenders have reduced the benefits and increased the fees associated with the title iv loans they do provide 
we and other schools have had to modify student loan practices in ways that result in higher administrative costs 
if the costs of their title iv loans increase  some students may decide not to take out loans and not enroll in a postsecondary institution 
in may  new federal legislation was enacted to attempt to ensure that all eligible students would be able to obtain title iv loans in the future and that a sufficient number of lenders would continue to provide title iv loans 
among other things  that legislation authorized the department of education to purchase title iv loans from lenders  thereby providing capital to the lenders to enable them to continue making title iv loans to students  and permitted the department of education to designate institutions eligible to participate in a lender of last resort program  under which federally recognized student loan guaranty agencies would be required to make title iv loans to all otherwise eligible students at those institutions 
while this legislation appears to have provided some stability to the marketplace for title iv loans  it is not yet clear if it ultimately will be effective in ensuring students access to title iv loans 
the environment surrounding access to and cost of student loans remains in a state of flux 
the department of education issued final regulations regarding student loans in july  which will go into effect on july   and congress is considering legislation to eliminate the ffel program and move all federal student lending into the fdl program 
the uncertainty surrounding these issues  and any resolution of these issues that increases loan costs or reduces students access to title iv loans  may adversely affect our student enrollments 
although we are approved to participate in the fdl program  because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the title iv programs  any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or our ability or the ability of our students to participate in the title iv programs could increase our costs of compliance  reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our institution  require us to seek to arrange for other sources of financial aid for our students and materially decrease our student enrollment  each of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
during fiscal year  we began participating in the fdl program for a portion of our title iv eligible students 
we expect to be able to transition fully from the ffel program to the fdl program by september while we have not encountered difficulties to date  a complete transition to the fdl program could cause disruptions in the administration of title iv program loans to our students if we or the department of education encounter difficulties with the systems or processes necessary for increased fdl program loans 
regulatory standards that may restrict institutional expansion or other changes many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies 
adding teaching locations  implementing new educational programs  and increasing enrollment 
the requirements and standards of state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the department of education limit our ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations  implement new educational programs  or increase enrollment in certain programs 
many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs  and arizona also limits the number of undergraduate nursing students we may enroll which represents a small portion of our overall nursing program 
the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the higher learning commission  and other state education agencies and specialized accrediting commissions that authorize or accredit us and our programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs  and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial  academic  and other qualifications of the institution 
for instance  following applications we filed in december  we received approval from the higher learning commission and the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in march to add our first doctoral level program 

table of contents with respect to the department of education  if an institution participating in the title iv programs plans to add a new location or educational program  the institution must generally apply to the department of education to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution s title iv eligibility 
however  a degree granting institution such as us is not required to obtain the department of education s approval of additional programs that lead to an associate  bachelor s  professional  or graduate degree at the same degree level as programs previously approved by the department of education 
similarly  an institution is not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in the same or a related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated by the department of education as an eligible program at that institution if it meets certain minimum length requirements 
however  as a condition for an institution to participate in the title iv programs on a provisional basis  the department of education can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs 
if an institution that is required to obtain the department of education s advance approval for the addition of a new program or new location fails to do so  the institution may be liable for repayment of the title iv program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program or enrolled at that location 
acquiring other schools 
while we have not acquired any other schools in the past  we may seek to do so in the future 
the department of education and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting commissions require a company to seek their approval if it wishes to acquire another school 
in our case  we would need to obtain the approval of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education or other state education agency that licenses the school being acquired  the higher learning commission  any other accrediting commission that accredits the school being acquired  and the department of education 
the level of review varies by individual state and accrediting commission  with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs while others only consider approval after the acquisition has occurred 
the higher learning commission would require us to obtain its advance approval of such an acquisition 
the approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions is a necessary prerequisite to the department of education certifying the acquired school to participate in the title iv programs under our ownership 
the restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other schools in some circumstances 
provisional certification 
each institution must apply to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs at least every six years  or when it undergoes a change in control  and an institution may come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding an educational program  or modifying the academic credentials that it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards 
in addition  if a company acquires a school from another entity  the acquired school will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the department of education approves the transaction 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the department of education 
if the department of education finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
we are currently provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis 
the department of education issued our current program participation agreement in may  after an extended review following the change in control that occurred in february the department of education s recertification imposed certain conditions on us  including a requirement that we post a letter of credit  accept restrictions on the growth of our program offerings and enrollment  and receive title iv funds under the heightened cash monitoring system of payment rather than by advance payment 
in october  the department of education eliminated the letter of credit requirement and allowed the growth restrictions to expire  and in august  it eliminated the heightened cash monitoring restrictions and returned us to the advance payment method 
we submitted our application for recertification in march in anticipation of the expiration of our provisional certification on june  the department of education did not make a decision on our recertification application by june  and therefore our provisional certification to participate in the title iv programs has been automatically extended on a month to month basis until the department of education makes its decision 
since june  we have filed updates with the department of education and communicated with department of education personnel in order to update our pending recertification application with relevant information  such as our status as a publicly traded corporation after the initial public offering and the identity of the members of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us while the investigation by the office of inspector general of the department of education is being conducted  while the qui tam lawsuit is pending  or at all  or that it will not impose restrictions as a condition of approving our pending recertification application or with respect to any future recertification 

table of contents change in ownership resulting in a change in control 
the department of education and the higher learning commission  as well as many accrediting commissions and states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control 
the types of and thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the various regulatory bodies 
under department of education regulations  an institution that undergoes a change in control as defined by the department of education loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
in connection with our initial public offering in november  we submitted a description of the offering to the department of education  including a description of the voting agreement entered into by certain of our stockholders 
pursuant to the agreement  brent d 
richardson  our executive chairman and christopher c 
richardson  our general counsel and a director collectively  the richardson voting group  controlled the voting power of approximately of our total outstanding voting stock after the initial public offering 
based on this description  the department of education concluded that our initial public offering did not result in a change in control under the department of education s regulations that were applicable to us before we became a publicly traded corporation 
with respect to publicly traded corporations  like us  department of education regulations provide that a change in control occurs if either i there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form k with the sec disclosing a change in control  or ii the corporation has a stockholder that owns  or has voting control over  at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation defined in the regulations as a controlling shareholder  and that controlling shareholder ceases to own  or have voting control over  at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
prior to the completion of our secondary offering  the richardson voting group was amended to also include endeavour associates fund iv  lp and affiliates and therefore the richardson voting group own or control more than of our outstanding voting stock following our secondary offering completed in september  the department of education has not concluded that the offering triggered a change in ownership resulting in a change in control under the department of education s regulations 
the higher learning commission provides that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in ownership  corporate control or structure in order for the institution to retain its accredited status 
in june  the higher learning commission adopted new policies and standards for the review of transactions that may constitute such a change in control 
one standard provides that a transaction may be considered a change in control if an individual  entity or group increases or decreases its control of shares to greater than or less than of the total outstanding shares of the stock of a parent corporation that owns or controls the accredited institution 
in addition  in the event of a change in control  the higher learning commission requires the institution to obtain its approval in advance of the change  and in certain circumstances that process may require several weeks or several months or more to complete 
in addition  following a change in control  the higher learning commission will conduct an onsite evaluation within six months in order to continue the institution s accreditation 
the higher learning commission did consider our initial public offering in november to be a change in control under its policies and  while it approved our consummation of the offering  it informed us that it would conduct a site visit to confirm the appropriateness of the approval and to evaluate whether we continue to meet the higher learning commission s eligibility criteria 
the higher learning commission  after conducting its site visit in march  determined  among other things  that the initial public offering was conducted in a manner that did not disrupt our ongoing operations and that no further action would be required as a result of the change in control  and formally approved the change in control in june because the richardson voting group owned or controlled more than of our outstanding voting stock following our secondary offering completed in september  we were advised by the higher learning commission that the offering would not constitute a change in control under its policies and standards 

table of contents even though the offering in september did not constitute a change of control under the department of education s regulations or the higher learning commission s policies  under the terms of the voting agreement with the richardson voting group  if any person party to the voting agreement transfers shares covered by the proxy in registered or open market sales  the proxy is no longer effective as to such shares 
accordingly  the number of shares over which the richardson voting group will continue to hold voting power will decrease over time as shares held by other parties to the voting agreement are sold  and we may not be aware of these sales since many of the shares subject to the voting agreement are held in street name 
if at any time in the future  as a result of such future registered or open market sales  the number of shares over which the richardson voting group holds voting power falls below  a change in control will occur 
at that point  with respect to the department of education  if we file a timely and materially complete application  the department of education may temporarily certify us on a provisional basis following the change in control  so that our students would retain access to title iv program funds until the department of education completes its full review 
in addition  the department of education will extend our temporary provisional certification if we timely file other required materials  including any approval of the change of control by the higher learning commission and the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  as required  and certain required financial information consisting of our recent sec filings showing our financial condition 
as a general matter  an institution is required to file the materially complete application within ten business days after the change in control  as measured from the date of the event that constitutes the change in control 
the deadline for an institution to timely file the other materials  including the financial documentation  that are required following a change in control is the last day of the month following the month in which the change of control occurs 
for an institution that is owned by a publicly traded corporation  like us  a related department of education regulation provides that the deadline to notify the department of education of a significant change in the distribution of the ownership of the institution is ten days  as measured from the date on which management of the corporation learns of such significant change or  alternatively  the date that the institution notifies its accrediting agency of such change 
if the department of education were to determine that we failed to meet any of these application and other deadlines  our certification would expire and our students would not be eligible to receive title iv program funds until the department of education completes its full review  which commonly takes several months and may take longer 
if the department of education approves the application after a change in control  it would normally certify us on a provisional basis for a period of up to approximately three years 
the precise conditions and duration of our provisional certification in this circumstance and what restrictions  if any  may be imposed  are difficult to predict because we have been certified on a month to month basis for an extended period and are subject to the ongoing investigation by the office of inspector general of the department of education and the qui tam lawsuit  which may affect the department of education s decision regarding the terms to attach when it next renews our certification 
with respect to the higher learning commission  if we anticipate that the number of shares over which the richardson voting group holds voting power will fall below at any time in the future  we would be required to obtain the approval of the higher learning commission before such event occurs 
however  because we may be unaware when such event occurs  we would seek the cooperation of the higher learning commission to allow us to arrange an appropriate review procedure at that time since there may not be an opportunity to obtain the higher learning commission s advance review and approval  as is typically required by its policies 
another policy of the higher learning commission provides that an institution is obligated to provide notice of certain transactions  such as the transfer of stock by an investor  promptly after the institution becomes reasonably knowledgeable of such transaction 
this policy suggests that  in certain circumstances  the higher learning commission can adapt its procedures to allow an institution  like us  to provide notice and seek the necessary approval after the institution gains knowledge of an investor transaction such as the sale of shares by other parties to the voting agreement  but there can be no assurance that would be the case with respect to this offering or any such sales of stock that may occur following the completion of this offering 
in such a circumstance  we cannot predict whether the higher learning commission would impose any limitations or conditions on us  or identify any compliance issues related to us in the context of the change in control process  that could result in our loss of accreditation by the higher learning commission 
any such loss would result in our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and cause a significant decline in our student enrollments 

table of contents many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval  but their thresholds for determining a change in control vary widely 
the standards of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education provide that an institution that is owned by a publicly traded company whose control is vested in the voting members of the board of directors  such as grand canyon education  undergoes a change in control if or more of the voting members of the board of directors change within a month period or the chief executive officer of the corporation changes 
a change in control under the definition of one of the other state agencies that regulate us might require us to obtain approval of the change in control in order to maintain our authorization to operate in that state  and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of the change in control 
we notified the arizona state board for private postsecondary education of our initial public offering and  based on our communications with that agency before and after the consummation of the initial public offering  we do not believe that our initial public offering constituted a change in control under arizona law that was applicable to us before we were a publicly traded corporation 
we notified the arizona state board for private postsecondary education of the offering in september of and the arizona state board for private postsecondary education confirmed in writing that such offering would not constitute a change of ownership or control under its standards 
if we were to undergo a change in control under the standards of the arizona state board of private postsecondary education at any time in the future  we would be required to file an application with the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to obtain approval for such change in control 
we cannot predict whether the arizona state board for private postsecondary education would impose any limitations or conditions on us  or identify any compliance issues related to us in the context of the change in control process  that could result in our loss of authorization in arizona 
any such loss would result in our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and cause a significant decline in our student enrollments 
we also notified other accrediting commissions and state agencies  as we believed necessary  of our initial public offering and the reasons why we believed that offering did not constitute a change in control under their respective standards  or to determine what was required if any such commission or agency did consider the offering to constitute a change in control 
none of the other accrediting commissions and state agencies that we notified of our initial public offering advised us that it concluded that the offering constituted a change in control under its policies or that it required us to take any further action 
we provided each of these other accrediting commissions and state agencies  as we believed necessary  with a notice and description of this offering before the consummation of the september offering 
none of them required us to obtain their approval in connection with the september offering 
if the september offering were considered a change of control under the standards of any of these commissions or agencies  and we failed to obtain the approval of that commission or agency  we could lose accreditation  state licensure  or be subject to other limitations or penalties 
additional state regulation 
most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries 
some states have sought to assert jurisdiction over out of state educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location in the state but that have some activity in the state  such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state  employing faculty who reside in the state  or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state 
state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states  and can change frequently 
in addition to arizona  we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state education agency in those states  which we have obtained  and in other states we have obtained approvals as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities 
we review the licensure requirements of other states when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies 
because state regulatory requirements  including agency interpretations  can change frequently  and because we enroll students from all states and the district of columbia  we expect we will have to seek licensure or authorization in additional states in the future 
if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for any state  we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization by that state  or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in that state  fines  and penalties 
while we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized  other than arizona  are individually material to our operations  the loss of licensure or authorization in a state other than arizona could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments
