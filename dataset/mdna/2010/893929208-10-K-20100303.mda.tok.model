item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included herein and or incorporated by reference into this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report or in documents incorporated by reference into this annual report 
overview we are the third largest medical transcription company in the united states based on revenue 
we serve approximately customers nationwide 
we estimate that our primary target market is approximately billion  comprised primarily of  community based hospitals hospitals accessible by the general public in the united states 
our mission is to provide accurate and timely documentation of the patient medical provider encounter at a competitive price 
customer service is crucial to our success  and we have consistently ranked among the top medical transcription service organizations in the industry 
our approximately  home based domestic medical language specialists transcriptionists  supplemented by our offshore partners  provide high quality medical documents and fast turnaround times  which also result in high customer retention rates  which have averaged more than measured by revenues over the last three years 
we develop and utilize an array of technology to support the transcription process  including robust voice capture systems  state of the art speech recognition technology  our proprietary internet based beyondtxt transcription workflow platform and various customer systems 
we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the increasing adoption and use of emrs because the data and narrative content we create comprise key portions of emrs 
outlook the us economy has deteriorated significantly since the fall of  stemming primarily from disruption in the global credit markets 
if the economy were to further deteriorate  we could see deterioration in the financial condition of our customers and collection of our accounts receivable 
the decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from the financial crisis  as well as general unfavorable economic conditions  could cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending  including spending for medical care 
job losses and the resulting losses of healthcare benefits could further reduce demand for healthcare services 
we have not experienced any noticeable deterioration in accounts receivable or transcription volume to date 
it is also uncertain what effect the credit crisis may have on the security of the us banking system  and specifically the bank where our cash and cash equivalents are deposited 
this could impact our access to and cost of capital 
in addition  fdic insurance does not fully insure deposits  and it is estimated that million of our cash and cash equivalents were not insured at december  in addition to the impact of the overall economic environment  the following trends and uncertainties could have a material future impact on our financial results the aging of the baby boomers will create increased demand for healthcare services  which should in turn create increased demand for medical transcription services 
over the next years  the us population over the age of is expected to increase from roughly million to million  according to the us census bureau 
increased adoption of emr solutions could result in greater demand for electronic documentation  including transcription of reports that are currently hand written 
alternatively  emr solutions could reduce the demand for traditional transcription since physicians could be required to point and click to complete a template rather than dictate to document portions of their patient encounters 
management believes that dictation is more efficient and produces a more robust record than using only templates  and we anticipate that in the future  hybrid solutions will become more common 
we believe that the pace of change in the healthcare industry has increased  particularly as it relates to 
table of contents adoption of the emr  and we expect this trend to continue 
we are addressing this opportunity and risk by exploring opportunities to make the data in our reports more useful to hospitals and by exploring the opportunity to partner with firms to more deeply integrate our service offering into total documentation solutions for hospitals 
increased use of speech recognition technology and offshore resources in the future could result in higher profitability for us 
at the same time  competition within the medical transcription industry  combined with use of offshore resources and speech recognition technology by our competitors  could create downward pricing pressure in the industry 
the potential net impact of these two trends is difficult to predict with certainty 
historically  our new customer sales have predominantly come from replacing incumbent medical transcription firms 
a significant portion  perhaps the majority  of medical transcription work in hospitals is still performed by hospital employees 
management sees a trend toward outsourcing medical transcription services that could have a positive impact on our financial results if the trend accelerates and we are able to successfully compete for the business 
we have not historically had difficulty in staffing to meet demand as we have grown 
however  looking at the industry as a whole  we do not expect the domestic labor market for medical transcriptionists to grow fast enough to meet increased demand 
we are addressing this challenge by increasing employee productivity through the use of speech recognition technology  utilizing offshore resources and by attempting to develop a reputation as one of the best places to work in the industry 
it is possible that in the future a tightening labor market could result in upward pressure on wages  but to date we have not seen evidence of this and we do not anticipate this occurring in the short term 
we have completed three acquisitions in  which have had a material impact on our financial statements 
acquisitions involve significant risk  including integration risk  and it is possible that we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we have made 
we have experienced annual operating losses in prior years  the most recent occurring in while we have increased our level of net income in recent years  there can be no assurance that operating losses will not occur in the future 
over the short term  excluding the impact of acquisitions  the variability in our earnings and cash flow is mitigated by the fact that our revenue is recurring in nature and our largest expense  the cost of the transcriptionists  is variable in relation to revenue 
critical accounting estimates that are material to registrant a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions based on knowledge of current events and actions  however  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we had goodwill and net intangible assets at carrying amounts of  and  respectively 
the total of  represents of total assets as of december  management reviews goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  management calculates the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and intangibles relate based on market capitalization of the company as a whole 
we have concluded that we operate in one reporting unit medical transcription services since all of our revenue is derived from medical transcription services and since we have one organization dedicated to the provision of our service 
the fair value of our single reporting unit is substantially in excess of its carrying value as of december  
table of contents intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment of intangible assets is evaluated in accordance with the impairment or disposal of long lived assets subsections of topic property  plant and equipment  which states that a long lived asset or asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on an evaluation as of december   none of our intangible assets require testing for recoverability or impairment 
contingent consideration payable 
contingent consideration payments were part of the agreements in connection with the acquisitions of trs and mdsi 
we estimated the fair value of these payables as of the purchase dates of each acquisition 
the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb s  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic business combinations requires that these estimates are re measured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved 
these interim changes in estimated fair value  along with any differences in the final settlement  are recognized in current operating expense 
the purchase date fair value of the trs contingent consideration was  as of december   the fair value of the trs contingent consideration was calculated at  the  difference was recognized as operating expense in the fourth quarter of and the total amount of  was paid in february  under the terms of the trs asset purchase agreement  the seller had until february  to accept or dispute our calculation of the contingent consideration payment 
on february   we received notice that the seller disputed our calculation and claimed an additional payment of million 
we have evaluated this claim and believe that no additional payments are due under the calculations outlined in the asset purchase agreement 
the purchase date fair value of the mdsi contingent consideration was  in the third quarter of the total contingent consideration in the amount of  was paid in the fourth quarter of resulting in a  reduction to operating expense 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   we had net current deferred tax assets of  of which  relates to mdsi  and net non current deferred tax liabilities of  of which  relates to mdsi 
deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to realize 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
fasb asc topic income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may not be realized 
we estimate future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding expected future revenues and expenses 
in addition  we must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable income 
we have valuation allowances against net operating loss carryforwards in certain states in which future taxable income in those states may not be sufficient to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in those states prior to their expiration 
stock based compensation 
our stock based awards are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc topic stock compensation 
we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock awards over the service period for which the awards are expected to vest 
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant 
we calculated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merten option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
legal proceedings 
from time to time in the normal course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings 
we evaluate the need for loss accruals under the requirements of asc contingencies 
we record an estimated loss for any claim  lawsuit  investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  then we record the minimum amount in the range as our loss accrual 
if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
on january   we reached a mediated settlement with our lady of the lakes hospital  inc olol which was finalized on february  under the settlement  olol released all claims  in contract and in tort  which were asserted or could have been asserted in the litigation against transcend 
in 
table of contents return  we agreed to pay  which was accrued at december  and paid in  to olol and released all claims under our counterclaim against olol 
on june   transcend entered into a master equipment lease agreement with farnam street financial  inc farnam street 
on april   transcend filed a complaint against farnam street  alleging breach of contract  fraud and violation of the deceptive trade practices act  among other things 
on september   farnam street filed a claim against transcend  alleging breach of contract  among other things 
on february   transcend and farnam street agreed to dismiss farnam street s claim  with the expectation that farnam street will counter claim under our original complaint 
the dispute centers around lease renewal  lease termination and lease buy out provisions 
the lawsuit is in the early procedural stages 
we have determined that the probability of a gain is remote  the probability of a loss is reasonably possible but not probable and that the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to revenue of million in the million increase in revenue is attributable to revenue contributed by the acquisitions of million deventure million  trs million and mdsi million  increased revenue from existing customers of million and revenue from new customers of million  offset by a decrease in revenue of million from customers who terminated their contracts in direct costs increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in direct costs include costs attributable to compensation for transcriptionists  fees paid for speech recognition processing  telephone expenses  recruiting  management  customer service  technical support for operations  and implementation of transcription services 
transcription compensation is a variable cost based on lines transcribed or edited multiplied by specified per line pay rates that vary by individual as well as type of work 
speech recognition processing is a variable cost based on the minutes of dictation processed 
all other direct costs referred to above are semi variable operations infrastructure costs that periodically change in anticipation of or in response to the overall level of production activity 
as a percentage of revenue  direct costs increased to in from in the increase in costs as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to a decrease in the percentage of work processed on the company s beyondtxt transcription platform versus other platforms from in to in work processed on beyondtxt has lower costs due to the use of speech recognition technology to produce drafts of reports which are then edited by our medical language specialists 
the decrease in the percentage of beyondtxt work is due to the impact of additional non beyondtxt work processed for customers from the three acquisitions completed in direct costs as a percentage of revenue were also higher for the acquired businesses 
in addition  implementation and support costs have grown in order to manage conversion of some acquired customers onto beyondtxt and to support the larger customer base 
with all other factors remaining stable  we believe that direct costs as a percent of revenue should decrease in as customers from acquisitions are migrated to our beyondtxt platform 
approximately of our transcription work was performed offshore during  compared to during during  approximately of our volume was edited using speech recognition technology on the beyondtxt platform  compared to during gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in compared to in see direct costs discussion 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation from the additions to the sales team  increases in commissions on sales  an increased focus on advertising and marketing and increased fees paid to group purchasing organizations 

table of contents research and development expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses and increases in hardware and software maintenance costs related to information technology initiatives 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and in general and administrative expenses for deventure  trs and mdsi collectively contributed  of the increase 
we incurred  of transaction costs related to acquisitions in we also recognized a net expense of  due to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions 
the balance of  of the increase was due primarily to increased compensation  contract services and professional fees  employee benefits costs  and stock based compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of deventure  trs and mdsi contributed  of the increase 
the remaining  was due to growth in depreciable assets 
interest and other expense increased  to  in  compared to  in the increase is due primarily to increases in amortization of prepaid costs related to the credit facility that we entered into with regions bank in and the write off of  of prepaid costs related to the early termination of our facility with healthcare finance group  or hfg  and the promissory note payable to development corporation of abilene  inc  or dcoa  an increase in interest expense and lower interest income on cash due to lower interest rates and cash balances for most of the year 
we reported income tax expense of  in compared to  in the provision increased primarily due to higher pre tax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate of for compared to for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to revenue of million in the million increase in revenue consisted of increased revenue from existing customers of million  revenue from new customers of million  partially offset by decreases in revenue of million from customers who cancelled their contracts in direct costs increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in direct costs include costs attributable to compensation for transcriptionists  recruiting  management  customer service  technical support for operations  fees paid for speech recognition processing  telephone expenses and implementation of transcription services 
transcription compensation is a variable cost based on lines transcribed or edited multiplied by specified per line pay rates that vary by individual as well as type of work

all other direct costs referred to above are semi variable production infrastructure costs that periodically change in anticipation of or in response to the overall level of production activity 
as a percentage of revenue  direct costs decreased to in from in the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to cost savings that resulted from an increase in the use of our speech recognition enabled beyondtxt platform  growth of semi variable direct costs of operations at a slower rate than the rate of revenue growth and the use of increased offshore transcription resources 
approximately of our transcription work was performed offshore during  compared to during during  approximately of our volume was edited using speech recognition technology on the beyondtxt platform  compared to during gross profit increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in compared to in see direct costs discussion 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were and in and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to the addition of an executive vice president of sales and marketing and three regional sales directors during research and development expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and the increase is primarily due to increased data infrastructure expense and third party software license expense 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in  compared to million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and the increase was due primarily to an increase in healthcare insurance  compensation and audit costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue in and were 
the increase is due to additional capital spending in and in late interest and other expense decreased  to  in  compared to  in the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in the amount of debt outstanding during compared to  along with increased cash which drove interest income higher 
we reported income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in during the fourth quarter of  we performed a detailed review of its income tax position  specifically the valuation allowance that had been established against deferred tax assets 
as a result of the review  management determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of its net operating loss carryforwards and that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary  except for a  valuation allowance as of december  against the deferred tax asset related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards which will more likely than not expire before being utilized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance over the course of resulted in an income tax benefit of million in  offset by current and deferred tax expense of million 
during  we recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of based on a detailed review of our tax provision and further reductions in the valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease obligations discussed below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years short term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes projected interest payments 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  working capital of  and availability of approximately million on our line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable see note 
we had  of debt outstanding as of december  and did not utilize our available line of credit in cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to use of available net operating loss carryforwards in that were fully utilized in and changes in working capital  partially offset by improved profitability before income taxes 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the outflow in was due to the acquisitions of deventure for  trs for  and mdsi for   in capital expenditures and  for the purchase of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash used in financing activities of  in the same period in the cash provided during was mainly due to net proceeds of  from our follow on offering that closed in december  in addition  cash was provided from the tax benefit for share based payments of  the proceeds on the exercise of stock options of  and the proceeds of borrowing of  offset by note repayments of  in  the outflow consisted of note repayments of  offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
we maintained a four year credit facility with healthcare finance group  or hfg  that was due to mature on december  and was initially comprised of up to million on an accounts receivable based revolving promissory note and up to million of term loans to fund acquisitions 
the term loan portion expired on december  on august   we terminated our credit facility with hfg in order to secure new financing from regions bank 
on august   transcend and mdsi entered into a loan and security agreement with regions bank 
transcend and mdsi are both borrowers under the loan and security agreement  which replaced our credit facility with hfg 
the agreement with regions bank includes a one time term loan of million for the costs and expenses of  and to the extent necessary a portion of the purchase price for  the purchase of mdsi 
the loan and security agreement also provides for up to million in a revolving loan commitment based on eligible accounts receivable 
we may use proceeds of the revolving loan only for working capital  general corporate purposes  and for specified acquisitions 
the maximum amount of the revolving loan may be increased at the discretion of regions bank to million 
the term loan is payable in monthly installments of  beginning december  and ending august  the revolving loan commitment expires in august  borrowings bear interest at a rate based on the current libor  and are secured by substantially all of the borrowers assets 
the outstanding balance on the term loan was  as of december  the loan and security agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants customary for financings of this type 
among other things  the loan and security agreement restricts the borrowers from incurring certain additional debt  prohibits the borrowers from creating  permitting or allowing certain liens on their property  restricts the payment of dividends  distributions and other specified equity related transactions by us  and prohibits certain borrowings and specified transactions with affiliates 
the loan and security agreement also requires the maintenance of a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  tangible net worth  and cash flow leverage  as defined in the agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the agreement except the covenant related to annual lease expense 
regions bank issued a waiver of this covenant as of december  and the agreement was amended in february to increase the maximum annual lease expense allowable 

table of contents we anticipate that cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations should be sufficient for the next twelve months to finance operations  make capital investments in the ordinary course of business  pay contingent amounts related to previous acquisitions  and pay indebtedness when due 
part of our growth strategy is the completion of acquisitions 
management believes that available cash and our credit facility together with other acquisition options  such as seller financing  are only sufficient to complete small to medium sized acquisitions 
additional financing will be required for larger acquisitions 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date 
however  the effects of inflation on future operating results will depend in part on our ability to increase prices or lower expenses  or both  in amounts that offset inflationary cost increases 
contract prices are generally fixed for the duration of the contractual period and typically do not provide for price increases over the term of the contract  which usually extends from one to three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we had no material exposure to market risk from derivatives or other financial instruments as of december  we do have a floating rate of interest on our credit facility 
as of december   the current balance of the term loan under our credit facility was  and the current rate was 
on the current payment plan  this debt will be paid off by mid and a increase in the interest rate would not significantly increase interest expense
