the company is party to various interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the management of borrowing costs 
as of december   the fair value of the company s net position would result in cash payments of million 
future changes in the us interest rate environment would correspondingly affect the fair value and ultimate settlement of the contracts 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against the variability in exchange rates on cash flows and intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   there is million unrealized losses on the company s foreign exchange contracts 
volatility in the future exchange rates between the us dollar and euro  canadian dollar and british pound will impact the final settlement of any of these contracts 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of the company s commercial commitments and the notional amount by expiration period as of december  in millions notional amount by expiration period less than total year years years financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit purchase obligations total commercial commitments financial standby letters of credit largely relate to casualty insurance policies for the company s workers compensation  automobile  general liability and product liability policies 
performance standby letters of credit represent guarantees of performance by foreign subsidiaries that engage in cross border transactions with foreign customers 
purchase obligations relate to commercial chassis 
as of december   the company has a liability of approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits refer to note 
due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for this liability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
inventory reserve the company performs ongoing evaluations to ensure that reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are properly identified and recorded 
the reserve balance includes both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves at are established for identifiable obsolete products and materials 
general reserves for materials and finished goods are established based upon formulas which reference  among other things  the level of current inventory relative to recent usage  estimated scrap value and the level of estimated future usage 
historically  this reserve policy has given a close approximation of the company s experience with excess and obsolete inventory 
the company does not foresee a need to revise its reserve policy in the future 
however  from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve balance 

table of contents warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty costs as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the increase in the rate in is primarily due to increased costs in the environmental solutions group 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
after the claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to resolve the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from hearing loss litigation see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
if the company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the appropriate time 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit 
the company had no goodwill impairments in  or the fair values of the 
table of contents reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts by or more  except at the environmental solutions group reporting unit 
the fair value of the environmental solutions group reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
the environmental solutions group reporting unit s goodwill is million 
adverse changes to the company s business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods which could be material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a summary of the company s goodwill 
indefinite lived intangible assets an intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
these assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when evaluating if an intangible asset has a finite useful life 
in addition  for indefinite lived intangible assets  significant judgment is applied in testing for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
the company had no impairments of indefinite lived intangible assets in  or adverse changes to the company s business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods which could be material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a summary of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
postretirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 
the following table summarizes the impact that a change in these assumptions would have on the company s operating income in millions assumption change basis basis point increase point decrease discount rate return on assets employee compensation levels the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to published high quality bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure us pension liabilities decreased from in to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation expense the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective 
table of contents grant date fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including the company s stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we base the assumption on the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  asc topic sfas no 
r also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
therefore  only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we revise the rate if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within percentages between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk although the majority of sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars  the company has exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro and british pound 
if average annual foreign exchange rates collectively weakened against the us dollar by  pre tax earnings in would have decreased by million from foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates
