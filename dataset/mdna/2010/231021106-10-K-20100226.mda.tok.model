item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements 
our md a is presented in the following sections executive summary and financial highlights results of operations restructuring and other charges operating segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and other commercial commitments off balance sheet financing application of critical accounting estimates recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines  electric power generation systems and engine related component products  including filtration  exhaust aftertreatment  fuel systems  controls and air handling systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including paccar inc  daimler trucks north america  chrysler group  llc  volvo ab  ford motor company  komatsu  man nutzfahrzeuge ag formerly volkswagen and case new holland 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators 
the components segment sells filtration products  exhaust aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve 
table of contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by political  economic and regulatory matters  including environmental and emissions standards  in the countries we serve 
at the same time  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 
the global economic downturn in extensively challenged most of our businesses and the markets in which they operate 
all of our operating segments incurred double digit declines in net sales and three business units incurred a decrease in ebit ranging from percent to percent 
our joint ventures throughout the world also experienced severe downturns in operating results causing income from equity investees to decline percent 
we experienced significant decreases in market demand for many of our products 
the challenging worldwide economy impacted all of our business units in different ways 
our power generation and distribution businesses  which have longer lead times  began to see declines in while our other businesses started to experience declines in the second half of  especially in the fourth quarter 
demand in most of our markets around the world appears to have reached bottom and we believe those markets have stabilized at these lower levels 
we are also seeing improvements in emerging markets including china  india and brazil 
the economy in the united states us  while showing some signs of recovery  still remains fragile and unemployment continues to remain high 
in the second half of  we experienced increased sales in our global engine markets and in north america  we experienced a temporary increase in engine and related component demand prior to the emissions standard change 
the increased demand was consistent with sales trends we observed in prior emissions implementations and was the primary reason for sales to us markets increasing to percent of total net sales in  compared with percent of total net sales in throughout the year  we took actions to align our businesses with reduced customer demand  particularly in the first nine months of these actions included global workforce reductions and closing certain manufacturing operations 
costs associated with these restructuring actions  in conjunction with significantly reduced demand and volumes  negatively impacted our operating results in compared to and results 
at the same time  we took actions which enabled us to end the year with a stronger balance sheet 
we closely monitored our receivables and customer relationships  reduced inventories percent  reduced capital expenditures percent and increased our cash and marketable securities by over billion  generating over billion in cash from operations 
at the same time  we lowered our debt to capital ratio  maintained our credit ratings  improved our pension funding through increased contributions and strong returns and our billion line of credit remains unused 
as a result of the temporary increase in sales in the second half of  and the challenging economy  we expect new environmental protection agency epa emission compliant engine and component demand will be weak in the first half of excluding the emerging markets  we expect overall demand in most of our businesses to remain at relatively low levels for the first half of while we expect overall demand for most of our products to be weak in the first half of  with some improvements in demand in emerging markets  the actions that we initiated in late and throughout will continue to enable us to navigate through the challenging economic environment and will position us to respond to market conditions when and where they improve 
our short term priorities remain continue to earn a solid profit  continue to align our cost structure and manufacturing capacity with real demand for our products  continue to invest in critical technologies  products and capacity  and continue to demonstrate that we care about our customers more than anyone else

table of contents outlook near term many of the markets we serve have slowed significantly as a result of the credit crisis and the challenging global economic environment  however  demand in most of our markets appears to have reached bottom and we are seeing signs that markets have stabilized at these levels 
we are also seeing improvement in emerging markets including china  india and brazil 
consistent with prior emissions standards implementation  the north american on highway markets experienced increased demand prior to the implementation of the epa s emissions standards 
based on our prior experience we expect epa engine and component sales to on highway oem customers to be very weak in the first half of in most of our other markets we expect demand to remain stable with current levels for the first half of  while we expect emerging markets to have sales comparable to levels 
long term while there is uncertainty in the near term market as a result of the current economic conditions and market dynamics surrounding the epa emissions standards change  we are confident that opportunities for long term growth and profitability will continue in the future

industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction  marine and mining markets by percent  percent and percent  respectively 
stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the power generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand 
medium duty truck sales decreased significantly due to a percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn 
the us market was impacted by the economic downturn  however  this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the january   emissions standards change and improving market share 
heavy duty truck sales declined as international units sold were down percent 
we experienced a decline in mexican heavy duty sales due to an increase in heavy duty truck sales in the first six months of resulting from the increased activity ahead of mexico s july   new emissions requirements  appreciation of the us dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the us and canada permitted under a new law

medium duty truck sales increased due to increased demand in global medium duty truck markets  primarily due to our market share increases in the north american medium duty truck market  weaker demand in the first six months of resulting from the pre buy to replace trucks ahead of the emissions standards change and strong demand in latin america driven by strong economic conditions in brazil in stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our power generation segment  especially internationally 
medium duty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the north american bus market

table of contents liquidity and capital resources management s assessment of liquidity we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the difficult environment in the us and global economies 
our strong financial performance  particularly in the fourth quarter of  enabled us to finish the year with minimal debt and sizable cash and marketable securities balances 
this cash performance was driven primarily by improved inventory management  controls on capital and discretionary spending and lower repurchases of common stock 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
as of december   other sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  billion available under our revolving credit facility  million  based on eligible receivables  available under our accounts receivable sales program and million available under international and other domestic credit facilities 
the maturity schedule of our existing long term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term 
required annual principal payments range from million to million over each of the next five years 
while the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted  we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  dividend payments  common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 
we have considered the impact of ongoing market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and are monitoring the impact on our customers and suppliers 
we have noticed an impact as reflected in our days sales in receivables  but have not seen a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in we expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program  however  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in we will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of continued difficult economic conditions and our customer s access to credit 
the overall decline in market valuations negatively impacted the current value of our pension trusts in  however  pension assets produced strong positive returns in at this time  we are comfortable that the currently unused billion credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us 
this assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility  throughout the year  with a prompt repayment  to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility 
we successfully tested the facility again in february as a result  we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions 
a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december   are denominated in 
table of contents foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
working capital summary we fund our working capital with cash from operations and short term borrowings when necessary 
various assets and liabilities  including short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs

the increase in receivables was due to higher sales in global engine markets  higher sales in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of as a result of a temporary increase in engine and related component demand prior to the emissions standards change and the significant decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of as a result of the onset of the economic recession 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in inventories as a result of our efforts to reduce our working capital 
current liabilities decreased primarily due to a decline in other accrued expenses and accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volume and controls around discretionary spending

net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations  primarily inventories  as a result of management s response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by decreased income as the result of declining sales 
management s priorities included reducing inventory  aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital 
pensions the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets  market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans 
as a result of the credit crisis and the related market recession  our pension assets experienced significant deterioration in the financial market distress of continued into early with the debt and equity markets bottoming out in the first quarter 
in the second half of  the financial markets began to rebound 
the recovery helped to improve our plan performance 
thus  for the year ended december   the return for our us plan was above percent while our uk plan return was above percent 
the most recent three year average return for all of our pension invested assets was slightly above one percent 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities 
the remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments  including real estate and private equity 
we made million of pension contributions in and we anticipate making contributions of million to million to our pension plans in expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 
claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate million in the million of pension contributions in included voluntary contributions of million 
these contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to participants

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the recoverability of an investment related to new products  the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
recoverability of investment related to new products we have capitalized million associated with the future launch of our light duty diesel engine product 
market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs 
we concluded that events and circumstances indicated that these assets should be reviewed for possible impairment at december  we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write down is appropriate 
these projections require estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed 
we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios 
our analysis indicated that the assets are recoverable at december  if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and or product applications  we could be required to write down these assets to net realizable value 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs  primarily base warranty and other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note  product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to 
table of contents realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets included million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap 
gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a year average market value of return 
the long term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities  fixed income  real estate and other miscellaneous investments 
the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate for long term expected return assumptions us plans non us plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  
table of contents amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and non us pension plans  respectively 
under gaap  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period through and our expected expense for net periodic pension expense in millions pension expense the increase in periodic pension expense in was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession 
another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans non us plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by standard poors for the us and iboxx for the us all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and us were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of december  the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
our model called for years of benefit payments 
for the us plans  the sum of the cash flows from the bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process 
the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio 
the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
in developing the uk discount rate  excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years  thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed 
as a result  the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining 
we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

table of contents the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in millions impact on pension expense increase decrease discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets percent increase percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
our investment policies in the us and us provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long term strategic asset allocation 
we are committed to its long term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection 
rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur 
the rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns 
for the us qualified pension plans  our assumptions for the expected return on assets was percent in projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
except for the short term adverse conditions in the equity markets in  our recent three year annual rates of return have all exceeded percent 
as a result  based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year in for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows percentage of plan assets at december  target allocation investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total 
table of contents actual cash funding for our us pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of the act 
the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes 
among its many provisions  the act establishes a percent funding target for plan years beginning after december   which has now been extended to by the us congress due to the recession 
our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate 
the table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period and our expected range of contributions for pension contributions in millions contributions contributions beyond will depend on the funded status of our us plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act and contractual obligations negotiated in the uk our pension plans in the us and outside the us were under funded at december   by a total of million due to pension trust asset performance 
under gaap  the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs credits are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders equity by million after tax in the increases resulted from lower discount rates and higher mortality assumptions partially offset by improved plan asset performance in note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under gaap accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
in accordance with gaap  our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment 
however  there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes 
these two situations are described further below 
this analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing within our components operating segment  emissions solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit 
this reporting unit accounts for almost percent of our total goodwill balance at december  also within our components segment  our turbocharger business is considered a separate reporting unit 
within our power generation segment  our alternator business is considered a separate reporting unit 
within our engine segment  our recon business is considered a separate reporting unit 
this reporting unit is in the business of remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components 
our distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services 

table of contents no other reporting units have goodwill 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate a weighted average cost of capital  which reflects a market rate  for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and  if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
in addition  we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by gaap and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million  approximately percent of which resided in the emissions solutions plus filtration reporting unit 
for this reporting unit  a percent reduction in our estimated future cash flows would not have impacted our assessment 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 
recently adopted and recenty issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements recently adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its existing standards for business combinations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the amended standards make significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions 
because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after january   the amended standards did not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in december  the fasb amended its existing standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december  the new standard established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries 
the new standard defined a noncontrolling interest  previously called a minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the new standard required  among other items  that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity  separate from the parent s equity  consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of income  and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value 
we adopted the new standard effective january  and applied it retrospectively 
as a result  we reclassified noncontrolling interests of million  million and million  respectively  from the mezzanine section to equity in the december   and balance sheets 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard 
in march  the fasb amended its existing standards for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standards require enhanced disclosures about a company s derivative and hedging activities 
we adopted the new standard effective january  and applied it prospectively 
the new disclosures required are included in note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb amended its existing standards for subsequent events  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods ending after june  and established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the new standard established the period after the balance sheet date during which we should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which we should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we evaluated subsequent events through february   which is the date our annual report was filed with the securities and exchange commission 
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in june  the fasb amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets  which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from gaap 
the new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized 
the new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred assets 
the new standard will require us to report any future activity under our sale of receivables program as secured borrowings as of january  as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this program 
in june  the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary 
the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie  b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach  and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments 
the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity s involvement in a vie 
while we are still finalizing our evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements  we believe the only impact will be the deconsolidation of cummins komatsu engine company ckec 
this deconsolidation will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
financial information about ckec is included in note  variable interest entities  to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times 
specifically  this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists 
the new rules are effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity swap contracts  foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
when material  
table of contents we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter party or our credit risk 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
we transact business in foreign currencies and  as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility  we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third party sales and purchases denominated in non functional currencies 
our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to one year 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  unrealized gain or loss  if any  is recognized in current income during the period of change 
as of december   the amount expected to be reclassified to income over the next year is not material 
for the years ended december   and  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge 
to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are considered economic hedges 
the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million debt  due in  from a fixed rate of to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap 
the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain 
table of contents or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense 
these gains and losses for the year december   were as follows december  in millions income statement classification gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings interest expense commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers 
in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and  consequently  fluctuations in gross margins  we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations 
the commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
as of december   we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of million from aocl to income over the next year 
for the year ended december   we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable 
the amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of million 
our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements
