item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts   as of january   for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for disputed claims and quality issues 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
as of january   the company has  accrued for inventory obsolescence and market reserves 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
see the comparison of to metals segment below 
as noted in note e to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  as of january   in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  are expected to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note e 
expenditures related to costs currently accrued are not discounted to their present values and are expected to be made over the next three to four years 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances  also referred to as triggering events  indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset or group of assets the assets may no longer be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant decline in the market price of the assets  a significant adverse change in the operating use or physical condition of the assets  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate impacting the assets value  including regulatory issues such as environmental actions  the generation by the assets of historical cash flow losses combined with projected future cash flow losses  or  the expectation that the assets will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of the useful life of the assets 
the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment requiring further testing during the year ended january  if the company concluded that  based on its review of current facts and circumstances  there were indications of impairment  then testing of the applicable assets would be performed 
the recoverability of the assets to be held and used is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the assets at the date of the test to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets over the remaining useful life of the assets 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  the company uses projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  which are derived using the most recent available estimate for the reporting unit containing the assets tested 
several key assumptions would include periods of operation  projections of product pricing  production levels  product costs  market supply and demand  and inflation 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the assets are disposed or use has ceased 
the company has goodwill of  recorded as part of its acquisition  in  of manufacturers soap and chemical company  a reporting unit operating within the chemicals segment  and  recorded as part of its acquisition on august   of ram fab  inc  a reporting unit operating within the metals segment 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  is to be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded  with its carrying amount 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized and the second step  which is a calculation of the impairment  is not performed 
however  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge equal to the difference in the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
in making our determination of fair value of the reporting unit  we rely on the discounted cash flow method 
this method uses projections of cash flows from the reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive these assumptions used in our testing from several sources 
many of these assumptions are derived from our internal budgets  which would include existing sales data based on current product lines and assumed production levels  manufacturing costs and product pricing 
we believe that our internal forecasts are consistent with those that would be used by a potential buyer in valuing our reporting units 
the wacc rate is based on an average of the capital structure  cost of capital and inherent business risk profiles of the company 
the assumptions used in our valuation are interrelated 
the continuing degree of interrelationship of these assumptions is  in and of itself a significant assumption 
because of the interrelationships among the assumptions  we do not believe it would be meaningful to provide a sensitivity analysis on any of the individual assumptions 
however  one key assumption in our valuation model is the wacc 
if the wacc  which is used to discount the projected cash flows  were higher  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would decrease 
conversely  if the wacc were lower  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would increase 
changes in any of the company s other estimates could also have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit s assets 
based on the company s initial review in the fourth quarter of  each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value  therefore no impairment loss was recognized 
the company believes that if impairment charges should occur with respect to its existing assets  the charges would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicated values for the related long lived assets  including goodwill  were less than the carrying values of those assets  significant impairment charges could be necessary

sales for the fourth quarter decreased percent compared to from a percent decline in average selling prices  coupled with a percent decline in unit volumes 
the segment experienced operating losses of  and  for the year and fourth quarter of compared to a profit of  for the year and a fourth quarter loss of  in the same periods in  respectively 
sales of commodity pipe were down percent and percent for the year and in the fourth quarter  as average selling prices declined percent and percent and unit volumes decreased percent and percent for the year and in the quarter  respectively  compared to the same periods of non commodity pipe and piping systems also experienced declines in sales for the year and fourth quarter  down percent and percent respectively 
the decrease in sales for the year resulted from a percent decline in average selling prices and a nine percent decrease in unit volumes 
the decrease for the quarter resulted from a percent decline in average selling prices  offset by a percent increase in unit volumes  when compared to the fourth quarter of the volume increase for non commodity pipe and piping systems in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from the acquisition on august   of ram fab 
the significant decreases in selling prices together with unit volume declines in both commodity and non commodity pipe and piping systems  without including ram fab and when compared to the same periods in  reflect the decrease in demand for these products resulting from the worldwide economic turmoil and recession 
this contributed to the large decline in both gross profit and operating income for compared to  and to the losses incurred in the fourth quarters of both and stainless steel surcharges  resulting primarily from the changes in nickel prices  peaked in october of after incrementally increasing over the six month period from may to october  and fell slightly over the next three months 
the surcharge averages remained at levels equal to approximately half of s averages throughout most of although we cannot precisely calculate the effect of the price declines  we estimate that they reduced profits by about  for compared to the lower volumes also generated unabsorbed manufacturing costs and taken together with the lower selling prices and unit volumes  caused commodity pipe to incur losses for the year and fourth quarter of responding to the poor economy  many of the piping systems customers extended their delivery dates throughout causing a decline in both dollar and unit volume sales compared to last year  and creating manufacturing inefficiencies throughout the segment 
the piping systems operations benefitted in from the completion of several favorable contracts  primarily in the lng market  which generated significant volume  revenues and profits in as a result of these factors  non commodity pipe and piping systems experienced significant reductions in sales and profits compared to the same periods of also contributing significantly to the segment s losses for the year and fourth quarter of was the accrual of a claim from a customer who is alleging that the segment delivered defective pipe in which the customer removed and replaced 
while we believe the claim is unwarranted  and we are vigorously defending it  approximately  in claims expense was recorded in  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter 
all of these factors taken together caused the segment to incur losses for the year and fourth quarter of selling and administrative expense decreased  or percent in when compared to  but increased to six percent of sales in compared to four percent of sales in the dollar decrease came primarily from decreased management incentives  which are based on profits 
comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales increased five percent for the year ended compared to from a seven percent increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a five percent decline in unit volumes 
gross profit for the year ended declined percent to  or percent of sales  from year end s total of  or percent of sales 
operating income for the year ended declined percent to  from year end s total of  sales for the fourth quarter of increased percent to  from sales of  in the fourth quarter of  resulting from a percent increase in unit volumes  partially offset by a percent decline in average selling prices 
the segment had a negative gross margin of  for the fourth quarter of compared to a gross profit of  or ten percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of the segment experienced an operating loss of  for the fourth quarter of compared to generating operating income of  in the fourth quarter of commodity pipe unit volumes increased percent in the fourth quarter of resulting in a three percent increase for the year compared to the fourth quarter and year ended the increase in commodity volumes reflects the apparent benefit that the unfair trade case  filed in january by us producers of stainless steel pipe and the united steelworkers union against china  had on imports over the last three quarters of  coupled with the very low volume experienced in s fourth quarter 
gross profits are impacted by stainless steel surcharges which are assessed each month by the stainless steel producers to cover the change in their costs of certain raw materials 
the company  in turn  passes on the surcharge in the sales prices charged to its customers 
under the company s first in first out fifo inventory method  cost of goods sold is charged for the surcharges that were in effect three or more months prior to the month of sale 
accordingly  if surcharges are in an upward trend  reported profits will benefit 
conversely  when surcharges go down  profits are reduced 
unfortunately  stainless steel surcharges began a decline in the third quarter of  which accelerated in the fourth quarter of and reduced profits significantly 
this decline created steady downward pressure on commodity selling prices causing average selling prices to fall percent in the fourth quarter of and percent for the year compared to the fourth quarter and year ended this resulted in an approximately  loss in the fourth quarter of under our fifo inventory method that matched the low selling prices with much higher inventory costs 
the rapid decline in commodity pricing also created an inventory valuation issue at year end as the market value of much of our commodity inventory fell below our costs  which led to an approximate  charge in the fourth quarter of to reduce the january  inventory value to market prices 
the non commodity business continued to deliver excellent results 
although unit volumes fell percent for the year and percent in the fourth quarter of  average selling prices increased percent for the year and percent for the quarter compared to the year and fourth quarter of the majority of the decline in unit volumes was attributable to our piping systems operation as customers pushed out delivery dates in the fourth quarter of in response to the economic downturn 
the increase in average selling prices was attributable to a change in product mix 
as a result  the non commodity business generated excellent gross profits for the year and in the fourth quarter of piping systems backlog was  at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to  at the end of the fourth quarter of selling and administrative expense decreased  or six percent in when compared to  but remained unchanged at four percent of sales in consistent with the dollar decrease was attributable primarily to decreased management incentives  which are based on profits  offset somewhat by an increase in sales commission expense  resulting from the increase in sales in compared to specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment delivered very good results in as operating income for the year increased percent to  on sales of  compared to operating income of  on sales of  in operating income for the fourth quarter of increased percent to  on sales of  compared to operating income of  on sales of  for the fourth quarter of during  the segment experienced rising raw material and energy costs throughout the year and while management increased prices in an effort to offset the cost increases  the increases were not sufficient to prevent the cost increase from impacting profitability 
during  the increases in raw material and energy costs abated and in some cases actually declined  forcing management to lower selling prices  which caused the sales decline for the year 
however  price levels remained at levels allowing the segment to maintain a higher level of profitability in compared to the segment experienced strong sales volumes in the majority of its markets throughout the fourth quarter of  which contributed to the increases in sales and profits achieved in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year 
on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with santolubes manufacturing  llc sm to sell the specialty chemical business of blackman uhler specialties  llc bu for a purchase price of  along with certain property  plant and equipment held by synalloy corporation for a purchase price of  all located at the spartanburg  sc location 
the purchase price of approximately  payable in cash  was equal to the approximate net book values of the assets sold as of october   the effective date of the sale  and the company has recorded a loss of approximately  resulting primarily from transaction fees and other costs related to the sale 
divesting bu s specialty chemicals business  which had annual sales of approximately  has freed up resources and working capital to allow further expansion into the company s metals businesses 
bu along with organic pigment s op pigment dispersion business  which was sold on march  and had annual sales of approximately  were both physically located at the spartanburg facility 
op completed all operating activities at the end of the third quarter 
as a result  these operations  which were previously included in the specialty chemicals segment  are being reported as discontinued operations 
selling and administrative expense increased  or two percent of sales in compared to the amount  and increased to eight percent of sales in from seven percent of sales in the increase resulted primarily from increased management incentives  which are based on profits

operating income declined percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of the increase in revenues in resulted primarily from adding new products during the year  together with increased selling prices of our basic chemical products to pass on some of the higher raw material and energy related costs 
the declines in gross profit and operating income for the fourth quarter of  when compared to the same period in  were caused primarily by our inability to pass on all of the increases in raw material and energy related costs 
selling and administrative expense increased  or eight percent in compared to the amount  and decreased to seven percent of sales in from eight percent of sales in the increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses primarily from commissions from the increase in sales in compared to unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note m to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate unallocated corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of include a  favorable adjustment from the reversal of accrued environmental remediation liabilities on projects at the company s spartanburg location that were completed in the quarter 
in addition  corporate expenses in the quarter were favorably impacted by reduced quarterly environmental charges of approximately  that were eliminated by the sale of bu at the end of the third quarter of unallocated corporate expenses for the year and fourth quarter also declined over last year s totals for the same periods as a result of decreased management incentives  which are based on profits 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense decreased  or eight percent  to  for  compared to  incurred in the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in management incentives totaling  in when compared to s total of  offset somewhat by environmental expenses in of  compared to  in interest expense in decreased  from as a result of decreases in borrowings and in the libor interest rate under the lines of credit with the company s bank

current conditions and outlook the metals segment s business is highly dependent on capital expenditures which have been significantly impacted by the economic turmoil 
falling stainless steel prices  the depressed economy  and distributors reluctance to restock inventories  have created a poor pricing environment for our commodity pipe 
surcharges began falling in november  but appear to have bottomed in january  and have increased over the last two months through march distributors maintained their inventories at lower than normal levels through the end of  but activity for both commodity and non commodity pipe over the first part of has improved  indicating that distributors may be increasing their inventory levels 
management believes it is benefiting from the stimulus spending by the federal government  which includes a buy american provision covering iron and steel  as we have seen increased bidding activity in both the water and wastewater treatment and power generation areas  significant parts of our piping systems business 
however  business opportunities remain extremely competitive hurting product pricing in all of our markets 
although management is disappointed with the level of profitability in  we remain confident that we are in an excellent position to benefit from the eventual improvement in economic conditions 
while the impact from current economic conditions both domestically and worldwide makes it difficult to predict the performance of this segment going into  we are seeing improvements in business conditions within our markets 
we believe we are the largest and most capable domestic producer of non commodity stainless pipe and an effective producer of commodity stainless pipe which should serve us well in the long run 
we also continue to be optimistic about the piping systems business over the long term 
piping systems continues to maintain a strong backlog  with approximately percent of the backlog coming from energy and water and wastewater treatment projects  and the ram fab acquisition should allow us to expand piping systems business 
piping systems customers have begun increasing their delivery requests under our existing contracts which should favorably impact profits over the first half of piping systems backlog was  at year end  of which  was from orders booked by ram fab  which was acquired on august  this compared to  at the end of we estimate that approximately percent of the backlog should be completed over the next twelve months 
the specialty chemicals segment ended with excellent results especially over the last half of the year 
business conditions continue to be strong in our markets and in anticipation of future growth  management is adding capacity and making capital improvements to its facilities 
the segment should continue to generate consistent profit margins over the first half of  assuming conditions in the segment s markets do not deteriorate from their current levels 
however  the depressed economic conditions make the segment s performance uncertain over the next several quarters
