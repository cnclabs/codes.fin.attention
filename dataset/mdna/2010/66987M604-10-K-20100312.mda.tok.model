item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this report 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information which speaks only as of the date of this report 
we are not obligated to update this information  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our obligation to file reports with the sec 
for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item a 
risk factors and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of current products principally includes third generation  or g  intelligent mobile hotspots  communications and applications software  usb modems  embedded pci express mini card modems and wireless pc card and expresscard modems 
we plan to introduce fourth generation  or g  products 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on a majority of the world s wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
our strong customer relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales 
most of our sales to wireless operators and oems are sold directly through our sales force 
to a lesser degree  we also use an indirect sales distribution model through the use of select distributors 
we are continuing to drive widespread adoption of our products through increased global marketing activities  expansion of our sales team and distribution networks and continued leverage of our strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wide area network  or wan  technology  ease of use  performance  size  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on time to market  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
we have agreements with lg innotek and inventec appliances corporation  or iac  for the outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  lg innotek and iac provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in europe  the middle east and africa  or emea 
factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products 
this may place significant demands on our resources 
the continuing economic uncertainties and the resulting slowdown in certain regional economies are causing  and we expect may continue to cause  contraction in demand for our products 

table of contents net revenues 
we believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g and g products  g and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  including our mifi line of intelligent mobile hotspots  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following economic environment and related market conditions  increased competition from other wireless data modem suppliers as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain a wireless data access feature  demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  timing of deployment of g networks by wireless operators  decreased demand for ev do and hspa products  and changes in technologies 
we anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months  including g and g products 
we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like alcatel lucent  dell  qualcomm  sprint pcs  verizon wireless  telefonica  virgin mobile  vodafone and major software vendors 
through these strategic relationships  we have been able to enhance our market penetration activities by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
cost of revenues 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to lg innotek and iac 
in addition  we currently outsource certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in emea to mobiltron 
all costs associated with these manufacturers and mobiltron are included in our cost of revenues 
cost of revenues also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalties  operations group expenses  costs associated with the company s cancellation of purchase orders  costs related to outside services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
operating costs and expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in north america  europe  and asia 
we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing net revenues from sales of these products 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating costs and expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million during  an increase of million or compared to net revenues for ev do product driven technology amounted to million in  an increase of million or compared to we benefited from strong sales of our mifi product primarily during the second half of that contributed significantly to the increase in ev do net revenues 
in addition  ev do net revenues were positively impacted by embedded module sales during the first half of primarily driven by sales to a content delivery device customer 
however  sales of embedded modules significantly decreased to laptop manufacturers year over year due to the impact of competing product available to oems during ev do products are primarily sold in the north american market and represented approximately of net revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the same period in net revenues for high speed packet access hspa product driven technology amounted to million in  a decline of million or compared to the decrease in sales of hspa products was primarily due to intense competitive pressure resulting in a steep decline in demand for our products in europe 
hspa products represented approximately of net revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the same period in we expect similar levels of competitive pressure in the hspa markets for the foreseeable future 
however  we expect the recent quarterly trend of sales declines to be modestly offset in by increased revenues from mifi product sales in europe as more wireless operators are expected to launch the product in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues in the primary driver of the decrease in cost of revenues in as a percentage of net revenues as compared to was a more favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 

table of contents additionally  cost of revenues in was negatively impacted by inventory write downs to the lower of cost or market in as compared to cost of revenues in included million of inventory write down to the lower of cost or market  which represents a decrease of million of write downs recorded in the higher inventory write down in resulted primarily from the effects of lower average sales prices and demand for our hspa products due to competitive pressures and the slowdown of the global economies 
increased competitive pressures may continue to negatively impact the average sales prices of our products 
this may require us in future periods to record inventory write downs to reflect lower of cost or market adjustments and revalue certain assets that may become impaired 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues in the increase was primarily attributable to the changes in product mix of net revenues and cost of revenues as discussed above 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues compared to million  or of net revenues in this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount  higher stock based compensation expenses  an increase in product testing and certification fees and an increase in equipment costs in the current year to support expanded research and development activities 
we continue to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our core business strategy 
as such  we expect to make further investments in research and development to remain competitive 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the amount of revenue recognized  and potential variation in the costs associated with the development of our products  including the number and complexity of the products under development and the progress of the development activities with respect to those products 
however  we expect to maintain or increase our investment in research and development to continue to provide innovative products and services 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million or of net revenues in this increase was due primarily to an increase in cooperative marketing and advertising funds to support the launch of new products including mifi 
although total sales and marketing expenses increased during  it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues during while managing sales and marketing expenses relative to revenue  we expect to continue to make selected investments in sales and marketing as we introduce new products  market existing products  expand our distribution channels and focus on key customers around the world 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in the decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower professional fees 
professional fees were significantly impacted during by approximately million in legal fees related to our ongoing class action securities litigation and our intellectual property device indemnification obligations as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
during  we incurred million in professional fees and related expenses as a result of our internal review of revenue cut off procedures  internal controls  and accounting related to certain customer contracts 
while we are closely monitoring and controlling general and administrative costs  we expect these costs will continue to include significant legal fees to defend claims described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents interest income expense 
interest income  net decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to although our average cash and marketable securities balance has increased period over period  average yields have decreased 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  to  of income compared to  of expense in this increase was primarily due to the year over year strengthening of the euro and the related foreign exchange impact on our respective euro denominated accounts receivable and cash balances 
also  our gross exposure to euro based financial balances decreased year over year due to decreased euro based sales 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was approximately  for fiscal  which represents an annual effective tax rate of 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the recognition of an approximately million benefit in related to a derecognition of our uncertain tax liability  a benefit of million from the impact of research and development tax credits  a million tax expense impact of accounting for share based compensation and a million increase in our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
in the third quarter of  we reduced our uncertain tax liability by approximately million  including a related interest accrual of approximately  due to the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the taxable year and the completion of the examination of our federal tax return 
approximately million of this amount benefited the tax provision as a discrete item 
we recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards granted under equity incentive compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units  but cannot recognize a tax benefit currently for those share based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of the accounting guidance in statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which was superseded and subsumed by asc topic  we recognize a tax benefit in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  and for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption this guidance  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
during  we recorded an additional tax expense of approximately million associated with share based compensation 
the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in an increase of percentage points in our annual effective tax rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished 
additionally  income tax expense was negatively impacted by activity related to our valuation allowance in during  management evaluated our deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that valuation allowance should be increased by approximately million based on uncertainty associated with our ability to utilize increased deferred tax assets 
this determination was based on available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and recent financial operations 
this determination required significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and is consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  was  excluding the valuation allowance adjustment 
net income loss 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  as compared to net loss of approximately million in although operating expenses increased during compared to the same period last year  net income was favorably impacted by the increases in net revenues and gross margin percentage as discussed above 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the decrease in net revenues was primarily attributable to decreases in sales for our ev do products partially offset by an increase in our hspa products 
the decrease in ev do product sales for the year ended december  compared to was approximately million  primarily due to lower unit shipments of our merlin express and pc cards  and ovation usb modems and the effects of a lower average sales prices for such products due to competitive pricing pressures and the slowdown of global economies 
our hspa product sales increased by approximately million during compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in unit shipments of our ovation usb modems and expedite embedded modules 
overall  ev do net revenues  which consist primarily of north american products  represented approximately of net revenues in compared to in while hsdpa hsupa products represented approximately of net revenues in compared to in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in was primarily related to the rate of decrease in the average per unit selling prices for products exceeding the rate of decrease in the average per unit cost of revenues and other market driven factors 
cost of revenues included million of inventory write down to the lower of cost or market due to the effects of lower than expected demand for certain products  the effects of the falling valuation of the euro  and poor macro economic conditions 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of approximately  related to technology licenses  production fixtures  and tooling equipment 
as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of the assets in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance contained in asc  and concluded that certain assets were not fully recoverable and an impairment loss was recognized in the year ended december  cost of revenues for the year ended december  included a million benefit due to a change in our assessment of contingent liability related to intellectual property claims 
we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss relating to these intellectual property claims 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  included share based compensation expense of approximately  compared to approximately  in gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues in the decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in revenues and cost of revenues as discussed above 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenues compared to million  or of revenues in this decrease in expenses reflected a decrease of million in consulting and outside service fees and the favorable impact of development cost reimbursements from a vendor totaling million 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in payroll related expenditures for ongoing research and development activities 
research and development expenses in included share based compensation of approximately million  compared to approximately million in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues in the reduction in expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in included share based compensation of approximately million  compared to approximately million in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues in 
table of contents during the year  we incurred approximately million in professional fees and expenses related to an internal review of our revenue cut off procedures  internal controls and accounting related to certain customer contracts 
general and administrative expenses in included share based compensation of million  compared to million in interest income expense 
interest income  net decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to a decrease in the average yields realized on our marketable securities and cash balances during the year  which resulted in lower income as compared to other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million  to  of expense compared to  of income in this decrease was primarily due to the foreign exchange losses on our euro denominated accounts receivable and cash balances 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax benefit rate of 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the impact of domestic and foreign tax credits for research and development expenses and the impact of accounting for share based compensation  for which certain share based awards are treated as permanent differences 
during  management evaluated our deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets should not be significantly revised 
approximately million of deferred tax valuation allowance relating to our canadian subsidiary was established based on the uncertainty associated with the canadian subsidiary s ability to utilize the increased deferred tax assets 
this determination was based on available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and recent financial operations 
this determination required significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and is consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  was million excluding the valuation allowance adjustment 
the tax expense for the year ended december  was million excluding the valuation allowance adjustment in during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million associated with share based compensation 
the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our annual effective tax benefit rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished 
net income loss 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  as compared to net income of approximately million in the decrease in net income was due to a decrease in revenue and our overall profitability as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
we do not currently have a revolving credit facility or similar loan agreement 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that will allow us to sell up to million of equity  debt or other securities described in the registration statement in one or more offerings by us from time to time 
as set forth in the shelf registration 
table of contents statement  the net proceeds from the sale of our securities may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we had not issued any securities under this registration statement 
working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities year ended december  in thousands increase decrease working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included in working capital 
as of december   our working capital decreased million over the prior year primarily due to our purchase of long term marketable securities during as of december   our marketable securities increased million primarily due to the investment of a portion of our net cash provided by operations 
see the discussion of cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities by major security type in note in the consolidated financial statements  and discussion of market risk that follows in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at december  to million at december  as a result of increases in cash provided by operating activities during historical cash flows the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for compared to million for during  the million increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to increased sales of our products and improved margins  along with the beneficial impact of certain working capital accounts 
the difference between our net income of million and our net cash provided by operating activities of million is primarily due to non cash charges 
table of contents including depreciation and amortization  charges for inventory losses  and share based compensation 
during  the difference between our net loss of million and our net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization  charges for inventory losses  and share based compensation 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was approximately million compared to million used in investing activities in the cash used by investing activities in was related to net purchases of marketable securities of approximately million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
the cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to purchases of property and equipment  offset by net sales of marketable securities 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily related to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and share purchases pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan  including related excess tax benefits  were higher in compared to due to increased stock option exercise activity 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to our repurchase of million of our outstanding common stock on the open market pursuant to a repurchase program 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by fiscal year total operating leases capital leases committed purchase orders total contractual obligations our liability for uncertain tax benefits  including interest  as of december  was approximately million 
our tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is not included in our table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we do not believe that we will pay such amount within one year from december   however  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future payments with respect to this liability 
other liquidity needs we expect to incur ongoing professional fees and expenses to defend litigation filed against us or related to our products  which litigation is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these costs cannot be estimated at this time 
during the next twelve months  we plan to incur approximately million for discretionary capital expenditures  including the acquisition of additional software licenses 
we believe our cash resources from cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  and our ability to raise capital under our shelf registration statement will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations  a material failure to satisfy our contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products 

table of contents we may raise additional funds to accelerate development of new and existing services and products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests and securities issued may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities  we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  provision for warranty costs  royalty costs  income taxes  foreign exchange forward contracts  and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is principally generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oem customers and value added resellers and distributors 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer s acceptance of the product  we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels 
to date  we have not incurred material price protection obligations 
revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances 
cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable 
to the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us  or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated  such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various factors  including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends 
in arrangements in which our hardware and software are delivered concurrently  we do not provide significant post contract customer support pcs and recognize revenue upon the delivery of the of the hardware product  assuming all other basic revenue recognition criteria are met 
as of december   we have not recorded any significant revenues from separate software sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows  which are determined using an expected cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically two to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that may change rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
provision for warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if  based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in a decrease in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we will continue to evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the impact of uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
foreign exchange forward contracts 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the economic exposure associated with cash and accounts receivable balances denominated in euros 
our forward contracts do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we mark to market the forward contracts and include unrealized gains and losses in the current period as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation expense 
we have stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis 
although the black scholes model is an acceptable model  the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards  as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of our million in cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of money market funds with the value of all of our cash equivalents determined based on level inputs  which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
at december   substantially all of our marketable securities are invested in fixed income products 
as such  our investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due in part to these factors  our future investment market values and income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
using a model that estimates the aggregate yield to maturity of our investment portfolio  we estimate that basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  our million in marketable securities by approximately  however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale within the meaning of asc topic  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
credit risk we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities  which include various security holdings  types and maturities  with a number of financial institutions 
although the global credit crisis appears to have abated somewhat  credit risk remains 
as of the date of this report  we have not identified any significant credit risk associated with any of the financial institutions that maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities 
however  our ability to support our working capital needs depends  in part  on our available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
as a result  any significant decrease in the value of our investments may materially adversely impact our ability to support our working capital needs 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards specified in our investment policy guidelines at the time the investments are made 
at december   we have cash and cash equivalents of million 
of this million  million is held in cash demand deposits 
our million in cash equivalents at december  was held in money market investments 
these money market funds attempt to maintain a net asset value nav of per unit of investment 
should the underlying investments held by these money market funds suffer significant losses to market value due to interest rate changes or perceived counterparty risk  the nav of these money market funds may suffer declines below the targeted nav 
we hold money market funds that target a balance of investment return and preservation of invested capital through diversified holdings 
as such  we do not believe we currently have significant exposure to nav declines for our money market holdings 

table of contents at december   we had million invested in our portfolio of marketable securities 
our investment policy guidelines limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the fair value of our marketable securities at december  was determined based on level inputs  which were derived based on quoted prices for identical or similar assets  which had few transactions near the measurement period 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we generate euro denominated accounts receivable from sales to customers that are members of the european union  and we lack significant euro denominated purchases and trade liabilities to offset our exposure to this euro denominated accounts receivable activity 
during the year ended december   euro denominated revenue was approximately million 
as a result  we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  principally change in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts  principally forward currency foreign exchange contracts 
these forward currency foreign exchange contracts cover a portion  generally to  but may cover up to  of our euro based financial assets 
at december   we had approximately million million of euro denominated financial assets  as compared to million million in forward currency foreign exchange contracts with expiration dates of days or less 
at december   we recorded an unrealized gain of approximately  on our outstanding forward contracts 
in addition  at december   we recorded approximately  in unrealized foreign currency losses related to our outstanding euro denominated accounts receivable balances 
both the unrealized gain on the outstanding forward contracts and the unrealized losses on outstanding euro denominated receivables were recorded in other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
assuming a translation of our euro denominated revenue for the year ended december  at an average euro to us dollar exchange rate of and a uniform ten percent strengthening or weakening of this exchange rate  we estimate that income before income taxes for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million 
this analysis does not give effect to any forward currency foreign exchange contracts that may be used to hedge foreign currency risk 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposure and hedging transactions 
our sales to non european union countries are typically denominated in us dollars 
competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to increase prices in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
sales of these products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  and in particular  the euro 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress the demand for these us manufactured products  reduce sales  or cause us to reduce per unit selling prices
