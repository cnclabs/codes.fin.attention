our distributed product decline was primarily due to a million decline in uniface and changepoint license fees  offset by a million increase in vantage license fees 
the license fee decline occurred during our first quarter of fiscal as the global economic slowdown that began during the second quarter of fiscal continued to affect the closure of license transactions for all our product lines

the improvement in the contribution margin for fiscal was due to growth in revenue  primarily from the healthcare industry  exceeding the growth in expenses which were relatively flat compared to fiscal as discussed below 
application services segment revenue revenue from application services increased million or during fiscal to million from million in fiscal and decreased million or during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to our continued expansion into the healthcare industry and  to a lesser extent  increased spending within the manufacturing industry 
we anticipate demand in the healthcare industry will continue to grow as hospitals  physicians and the united states government move towards establishing electronic patient health and medical records which will require secure computerized databases and environments for storing and sharing of information 
our healthcare portal and messaging solutions are designed to meet this demand and will be a factor in our future growth of the application services segment 
the decrease in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in spending by our automotive clients associated with the general economic problems within the sector  offset by revenue growth within the healthcare industry

restructuring charge fiscal and fiscal restructuring actions during fiscal and fiscal  the company incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  associated with the following initiatives aligning the professional services segment headcount and operating expenses after initiating a plan to exit low margin engagements and increasing the operating efficiency of our products segment and administrative and general business processes with the goal of reducing operating expenses 
during the second half of fiscal  the professional services segment s business model was realigned resulting in the company exiting engagements considered low margin or unprofitable 
this change required the company to undertake restructuring actions to reduce headcount and operating expenses resulting in restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  during fiscal and fiscal employee termination costs were million and million  respectively  due to the company eliminating professional services personnel and management positions 
the second initiative  to increase the operating efficiency of the company s products segment and administrative and general business processes  resulted in the company incurring restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  during fiscal and fiscal employee termination costs accounted for million and million  respectively  of the charges due to the elimination of positions within our products segment related to technology and sales and marketing personnel and corporate administrative and general positions 
as part of these initiatives  full or partial closing of seven offices occurred during fiscal  resulting in lease abandonment charges of million 
the remaining facilities charges for fiscal and fiscal primarily related to changes in sublease income assumptions associated with leased facilities that were abandoned in previous restructuring initiatives 
at this time  we do not have any initiatives that will require us to incur restructuring charges  however unanticipated future conditions or events may require us to reassess the need for further restructuring initiatives 
fiscal restructuring actions during fiscal  the company undertook various restructuring initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of certain critical business processes within the products segment resulting in a restructuring charge of million 
these initiatives included the realignment and centralization of certain product development activities leading to the full or partial closing of certain development labs and termination of approximately employees  primarily programming personnel 
the company also terminated approximately employees from various other functions of the organization  primarily within sales and marketing 

table of contents see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for additional details related to the restructuring charges and changes in the restructuring accrual for fiscal  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from licensing software products and providing maintenance services  web performance services  application services  and professional services including product implementation and consulting services 
we provide software deliverables that include licensed software product  maintenance and professional services related to our software 
we also provide non software deliverables such as professional services unrelated to our software and software as a service saas offerings where we grant the customer a right to use the software but they do not have the right or capability to take possession of the software 
saas offerings include web performance services and application services 
in accordance with asc revenue recognition  we split arrangements that include software and non software deliverables using either vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
product revenue recognition in order for a transaction to be eligible for revenue recognition  the following criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg  maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe of fair value for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe of fair value can be established 
when maintenance or services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or over the period in which the services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include term and unlimited capacity licenses as we do not sell maintenance licenses separately and therefore cannot establish vsoe for these undelivered elements in these arrangements 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate recognition of the software license fees  maintenance fees and as applicable  
table of contents professional services fees under asc however  to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue based on its determination of fair value 
we apply our vsoe of fair value for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and stand alone services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue using the residual method 
license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been delivered to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
license revenue associated with term transactions is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
web performance services fees our subscription fees relate to arrangements that permit our customers to access and utilize our web performance services 
the subscription arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
subscription fees are deferred upon contract execution and are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional and application services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for development services rendered under a fixed price contract  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and if determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
our application services fees are combined with professional services fees in our consolidated statement of operations and consist of fees for our on demand software and other services 
the arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain engagements related to our application services business involve a project to setup the customer s structure and provide on going support for the project 
revenue associated with these projects is recognized over the service period as the customer derives value from the services  consistent with the proportional performance method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete our fixed price or customer s structure setup projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

table of contents capitalized software we follow the guidance of asc costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed when capitalizing development costs associated with our software products and asc internal use software when capitalizing development costs associated with our web performance services and application services networks 
the cost of purchased and internally developed software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software technology that is generally three to five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products  services and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the performance test involves a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we measure the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the company performs step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg  economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock awards in accordance with asc share based payment 
stock award compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate of are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for fiscal risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in fiscal was per option share 
if we increased the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would decrease percent 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting

fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the cause of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in customer collections of million resulting from the decline in revenue  primarily professional services  and an increase in income taxes paid during fiscal compared to fiscal of million 
the decrease was partially offset by reductions in disbursements for employee payroll and benefits of million primarily due to the cost savings achieved from our restructuring initiatives 
the consolidated statements of cash flows included in item of this report computes net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of the effects of acquisitions  divestiture and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue have typically had the largest impact on the reconciliation of net income to compute cash flows from operating activities as we allow for deferred payment terms on multi year products contracts 
the increase in the net change of accounts receivable of million was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in professional services fees throughout fiscal on the accounts receivable balance 
the increase in the net change of deferred revenue of million from fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in deferred revenue associated with our web performance services since the gomez acquisition 
the other significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows the adjustment to net income of million resulting from the gain on divestiture of our quality and devpartner product lines the proceeds from the sale were recorded to investing activities and the change in accounts payable and accrued expense balances increasing cash flow from operating activities by million primarily due to the changes in our bonus and commission accruals which increased from march  to march  as of march   we had million accrued for restructuring actions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
at this time  there are no initiatives that will require us to incur restructuring charges  however unanticipated future conditions of events may require the company to reassess the need for further restructuring initiatives 
we believe our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating cash needs for the foreseeable future

the other significant change in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal relates to the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses causing cash flows from operating activities to decrease by million 
this change was primarily due to a larger restructuring initiative in fiscal as compared to fiscal and higher commission and bonus expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal  causing the associated accruals to be higher at march  as compared to march  as of march   million was accrued related to restructuring actions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to manage the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
cash investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
our investment portfolio consists of cash investments that have a cost basis and fair value totaling million as of march  the average interest rate and average tax equivalent interest rate were as of march  these investments will mature within the next three months 
we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and  are due in fiscal through fiscal  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated million positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue was derived from foreign sources in fiscal this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 

table of contents we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets 
we also have non us subsidiaries with financial instruments that are not denominated in their reporting currency 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss of a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
