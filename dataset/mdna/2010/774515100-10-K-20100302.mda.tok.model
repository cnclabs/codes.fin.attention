wholesale sales decreased million to million for compared to million for the million decrease in wholesale sales is the result of decreased sales in the majority of our footwear categories and apparel 
retail sales were million in compared to million for the million decrease in retail sales results from plant closings and layoffs in the manufacturing sector as the current economic conditions have impacted a significant portion of our retail customer base 
in addition  retail sales were negatively impacted by our ongoing transition to more internet driven transactions and the decision to remove a portion of our lehigh mobile stores from operations to help lower costs

restructuring charges 
as a result of our decision during the fourth quarter of to initiate a comprehensive series of actions to reduce the operating cost structure and  increase the operating efficiency of both our wholesale and retail divisions we recognized million of restructuring charges 
these actions involved the relocation of our wholesale division s customer care function from franklin  tn to nelsonville  oh  and the closing of underperforming mini stores in our retail division 
these charges were composed of severance and employee benefits related costs  transition costs  and facility exit costs  which includes facility shut down and lease contract termination costs 
non cash intangible impairment charges 
our evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets indicated that none of these assets were impaired 
as a result of our annual evaluation of intangible assets  in we recognized impairment losses on the carrying values of the lehigh and gates trademarks of million and million  respectively 
we recognized tax benefits relating to the lehigh and gates trademark impairments of million and million  respectively 
we estimated fair value based on projections of the future cash flows for each of the trademarks 
we then compared the carrying value for each trademark to its estimated fair value 
since the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value  we recognized the reductions in fair value as non cash intangible impairment charges in our operating expenses 
interest expense

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for compared to million the prior year

gross margin decreased to million or of net sales for compared to million or of net sales for the prior year 
wholesale gross margin for was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in the basis point increase reflects an increase in sales price per unit  as well as a decrease in manufacturing costs resulting from increased operating efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities 
retail gross margin for was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the basis point decrease is primarily the result of increased costs to purchase products

sg a expenses were million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales for the net change primarily reflects decreases in salaries and commissions of million  professional fees of million and freight and handling of non cash intangible impairment charges 
as a result of our annual evaluation of intangible assets  in we recognized impairment losses on the carrying values of the lehigh and gates trademarks of million and million  respectively 
we recognized tax benefits relating to the lehigh and gates trademark impairments of million and million  respectively 
we estimated fair value based on projections of the future cash flows for each of the trademarks 
we then compared the carrying value for each trademark to its estimated fair value 
since the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value  we recognized the reductions in fair value as non cash intangible impairment charges in our operating expenses 
in  we recognized an impairment loss on the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of million 
because the trading value of our shares indicated a level of equity market capitalization below our book value at the time of the annual impairment test  there was indication that our goodwill could be impaired 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  we valued the wholesale segment  for which all the goodwill applied  based on the guideline company method 
the companies we selected are publicly traded wholesale competitors who manufacture shoes and apparel 
while the selected companies may differ from the wholesale division in terms of the specific products they provide  they have similar financial risks and operating performance and reflect current economic conditions for the footwear and apparel industry in general 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that an indication of impairment did exist and the results of the second step of the impairment test resulted in an impairment of million or million  net of tax benefit to our goodwill 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million for the prior year 
a reduction in our average borrowings combined with reductions in prime and libor interest rates during resulted in a decrease of million in interest expense for interest expense for includes million of deferred financing costs

liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have been our income from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and other indebtedness 
over the last several years our principal uses of cash have been for working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth 
our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory  offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of january through march of each year and highest during the months of may through october of each year 
we typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital requirements 
as a result  balances on our revolving credit facility will fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
our working capital decreased to million at december   compared to million at the end of the prior year 
our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our corporate offices  property  merchandising fixtures  molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology 
capital expenditures were million for and million in capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million 
in may  we entered into a note purchase agreement  totaling million  with laminar direct capital lp  whitebox hedged high yield partners  lp and gpc lix lp  and issued notes to them for million  million and million  respectively  at an interest rate of payable semi annually over the five year term of the notes 
principal repayment is due at maturity in may the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down the gmac commercial finance gmac term loans which totaled approximately million and the million american capital strategies  ltd acas term loan 
the balance of the proceeds  net of debt acquisition costs of approximately million  was used to reduce the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
the note purchase agreement is secured by a security interest in our assets and is subordinate to the security interest under the gmac line of credit 
in march  we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility with gmac commercial finance gmac which was set to expire on january  the size of the facility was reduced to million from million and the maturity date was extended to april  the interest rates for the term of this amendment are libor plus or prime plus  at our option 
the financing costs associated with this amendment totaled approximately million 
the total amount available on our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under this facility and total capacity of million 
our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants which require us to maintain fixed charge coverage ratios  and places limits on the amount of our annual capital expenditures 
at december   we had no retained earnings available for dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
we believe that our existing credit facilities coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our continued liquidity  however  is contingent upon future operating performance  cash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facilities 
based on our expected borrowings for  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the subsequent twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million in income before income taxes and cash flows 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable debt and assume no changes in the composition of that debt 
cash flows cash flow summary in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the principal sources of net cash in included decreases of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory offset by decreases of million in accounts payable 
the principal sources of net cash in included decreases of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory and million in income taxes receivable offset by decreases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued and other liabilities 
the principal sources of net cash in included decreases of million in inventory and million in income taxes receivable combined with increases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued and other liabilities 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the principal use of cash in  and was for the purchase of molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology software and system upgrades 
financing activities 
cash used by financing activities during was million compared to million in and million in proceeds and repayments of the revolving credit facility reflect daily cash disbursement and deposit activity

the company s financing activities during included cash proceeds from the issuance of debt of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of million and repayments on long term debt of million 
borrowings and external sources of funds our borrowings and external sources of funds were as follows at december  and december in millions revolving credit facility term loans real estate obligations other total debt less current maturities net long term debt our real estate obligations were million at december  the mortgage financing  completed in  includes two of our facilities  with monthly payments of less than million through we lease certain machinery  trucks  shoe centers  and manufacturing facilities under operating leases that generally provide for renewal options 
future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are million  million  million and million for years through  respectively  and million for  or approximately million in total 
we continually evaluate our external credit arrangements in light of our growth strategy and new opportunities 
in march  we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility with gmac commercial finance gmac which was set to expire on january  the size of the facility was reduced to million from million and the maturity date was extended to april  the interest rates for the term of this amendment are libor plus or prime plus  at our option 
the financing costs associated with this amendment totaled approximately million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  resulting from financial contracts and commitments 
we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts are generally consistent from year to year  closely reflect our levels of production  and are not long term in nature less than three months 
contractual obligations at december  payments due by year millions total less than year years years over years long term debt minimum operating lease commitments minimum royalty commitments expected cash requirements for interest total contractual obligations assumes the following interest rates which are consistent with rates as of december  on the million revolving credit facility  on the million five year term loan  and on the million mortgage loans 
from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
additionally  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
inflation our financial performance is influenced by factors such as higher raw material costs as well as higher salaries and employee benefits 
management attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
we were able to mitigate the effects of inflation during due to these factors 
it is anticipated that inflationary pressures during will be offset through decreases in the cost of sourcing our inventory 
we expect these reductions to be generated by price reductions with our suppliers resulting from the competitive pressures which they are currently experiencing as a result of the current global economic conditions 
our suppliers are experiencing increased competition from other suppliers as a result of the underutilization of their available manufacturing capacity 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our management regularly reviews our accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles  pension benefits and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue principally consists of sales to customers  and  to a lesser extent  license fees 
revenue is recognized when goods are shipped and title passes to the customer  while license fees are recognized when earned 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on the relative age and size of trade receivable balances 
sales returns and allowances we record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances 
these reductions are influenced by historical experience  based on customer returns and allowances 
the actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased  then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
sales returns and allowances for sales returns were approximately and of sales for and  respectively 
inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable and we have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories at amounts above cost through our factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
intangible assets intangible assets  including goodwill  trademarks and patents are reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently  if necessary 
we perform such testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
in assessing whether indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows  long term growth rates of our business  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital and other factors such as  discount rates  royalty rates  cost of capital  and market multiples to determine the fair value of our assets 
these estimates and assumptions require management s judgment  and changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or impairment for each of our other indefinite lived intangible assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that indications of intangible asset impairment exist 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of our business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  competition  or the sale or disposition of a reporting segment 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
pension benefits accounting for pensions involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements for information on our plan and the assumptions used 
pension expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of december each year 
the funded status of our plan and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december actual results would be different using other assumptions 
on december  we froze the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all non us territorial employees 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying plan assets could result in losses or a higher accrual 
income taxes management has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net operating losses that it believes may not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   approximately million of undistributed earnings remains that would become taxable upon repatriation to the united states
