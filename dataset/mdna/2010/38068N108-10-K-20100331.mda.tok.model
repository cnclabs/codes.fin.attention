item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  dated march   is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition 
gold reserve  an exploration stage company  is engaged in the business of acquiring  exploring and developing mining projects 
from to we focused substantially all of our management and financial resources on the development of the brisas gold and copper project located in the kilometre mining district of the state of bolivar in south eastern venezuela which we refer to as the brisas project or brisas 
due to what we believe are the improper actions of the venezuelan government  we have been forced to discontinue development of the brisas project  as discussed below 
while we pursue arbitration  we are attempting to settle our dispute with the venezuelan government  mitigate our loss through the sale of brisas project assets  and are seeking to invest in or acquire an alternative mining project 
the brisas project has been expropriated by the venezuelan government  and we no longer have control or physical access to the project 
as a result  we no longer report mineral reserves for brisas  and we have discontinued the development of our venezuelan properties  including brisas and choco which was a grass roots exploration property also located in the state of bolivar 
on october   we filed a request for arbitration under the additional facility rules of icsid against the bolivarian republic of venezuela to seek compensation as a result of the expropriation and other violations of the canada venezuela treaty 
our request was registered by icsid in november for more information  see item legal proceedings  arbitration 
the information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k relating to our past development efforts  regulatory process and reported mineral reserves of brisas and choco are presented only for informational and historical purposes and should not be construed as an indication of our expectations regarding the future development and operation of these properties or the outcome of the arbitration proceedings 
the venezuelan ministry of mines mibam approved the brisas operating plan during and in early the venezuelan ministry of environment minamb approved the brisas environmental and social impact study for the exploitation and processing of gold and copper ore estudio de impacto ambiental y sociocultural or esia 
in march  minamb issued the authorization for the affectation of natural resources for the construction of infrastructure and services phase of the brisas project the authorization to affect 
in  we commenced significant pre construction procurement efforts with the assistance of our epcm contractor  awarding contracts for brisas site preparation and construction camp facilities and placing orders for processing equipment  early works construction equipment and various other site equipment totaling approximately million  accelerated detailed project engineering  hired a number of senior technical staff  completed the sale of approximately million of senior subordinated convertible notes convertible notes and million net of expenses in new equity  launched a number of environmental and social initiatives and commenced preparation of the brisas site for construction activities 
in april  the minamb revoked the authorization to affect 
venezuelan legal counsel advised management that the revocation of the authorization to affect was groundless and legally unsupported 
after months of continuous effort to meet with the venezuelan government and resolve the issues related to the revocation of the authorization to affect and the more recent denial in may of the normal course extension of the brisas alluvial and the el pauji concessions which by venezuelan law were already renewed  on october  we filed for arbitration against venezuela at icsid under the canada venezuela treaty 
in evident retaliation  venezuelan government personnel arrived at the brisas project camp site on october   claimed ownership of the brisas alluvial concession  seized assets  expelled our personnel  and took physical possession of the property 
subsequently on november   the venezuelan government notified us through the issuance of an administrative act  dated october   of its intent to cancel o ur underlying hard rock concession 
as a result of the expropriation of the brisas project by the venezuelan government and our loss of control and physical access to the project we recorded a million non cash write off of the capital costs associated with the expropriated assets  including an adjustment for the estimated net realizable value of certain processing and related equipment purchased for the brisas project of approximately million 
since acquiring the brisas alluvial concession in  we have spent close to million on the project including equipment recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and financial  legal and engineering costs incurred in support of our venezuelan operations and the write down of previously capitalized costs associated with our venezuelan operations recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
for more background in formation on the brisas project  see item properties 
the costs incurred since include property and mineral rights  easements  acquisition costs  equipment expenditures  litigation settlement costs  general and administrative costs and extensive exploration costs including geology  geophysics and geochemistry  approximately drill holes totaling over  meters of drilling  independent audits of drilling  sampling  assaying procedures and ore reserves methodology  environmental baseline work socioeconomic studies  hydrology studies  geotechnical studies  mine planning  advanced stage grinding and metallurgical test work  tailings dam designs  milling process flow sheet designs  environmental impact statement and bankable feasibility study  including a number of subsequent updates  and an independent csa national instrument report which was most recently updated in march deta iled engineering for brisas was approximately complete at the date of its expropriation by the venezuelan government 
we have no commercial production at this time and  as a result  we have not recorded revenue or cash flows from mining operations and continue to experience losses from operations  a trend we expect to continue unless and until the investment dispute regarding brisas is resolved favorably to the company and or we acquire or invest in an alternative project 
historically we have financed the company s operations through the issuance of common stock  other equity securities and convertible debt 
the company has only one operating segment  the exploration and development of mineral properties

likewise our october request for arbitration under the additional facility rules of icsid and the write off of the costs associated with our venezuelan operations will shape the future financial position and results of operations of the company 
we expect the arbitration process to last three to five years  consume substantial management time and cost an estimated to million  excluding the time and funds necessary to collect on any award

as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  in we initiated the exploration and development of the brisas project  located in the historic km mining district of the state of bolivar in southeastern venezuela 
the brisas deposit  which is one of the largest undeveloped gold copper deposits in the world  contains estimated ore reserves of million ounces of gold and billion pounds of copper 
from to  we focused substantially all our corporate and operations management and financial resources on brisas 
since acquiring the brisas alluvial concession in  we have spent close to million on the project including equipment recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and financial  legal and engineering costs incurred in support of our venezuelan operations and the write down of previously capitalized co sts associated with our venezuelan operations recorded in the consolidated statement of operations developing the brisas project into a world class mining project 
current plan as a result of the expropriation of the brisas project by the venezuelan government  our primary objective is to manage the arbitration effort in cooperation with arbitration counsel and various experts  to minimize costs and accelerate its completion  to the extent possible 
substantially all of the key management personnel have been employed by the company for over years with a single focus of developing the brisas project 
these individuals possess valuable historical knowledge related to the brisas project which is important to the successful execution of our arbitration efforts 
our other major objectives are to explore opportunities to settle our dispute with venezuela  sell brisas project assets  redeem  restructure or otherwise modify the terms of the subordinated notes  and continue evaluating alternative industry opportunities for an investment transaction 
the successful execution of these objectives will be facilitated by the company s senior management team which has substantial technical  financial and administrative experience related to the mining industry 
the timing of any such new investment or transaction if any  and the amounts that may be required cannot be determined at this time and are subject to available cash  sale of equipment originally slated for the brisas project and or future financings  if any 
critical accounting estimates we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
based on certain probability weighted alternative outcomes  management considers the sum of the expected future net cash flows to be generated from the use or disposition of a long lived asset undiscounted and without interest charges and compares that to its carrying value and if such expected future net cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to fair value 
fair value is generally determined by discounting estimated cash flows  using quoted market prices where available or making estimates based on the best information available subsequent to the expropriation and the resulting loss of control and physical access to the brisas project  we recorded a million non cash write off of the carrying value of the expropriated assets including an adjustment for the estimated net realizable value of certain processing and related equipment purchased for the brisas project of approximately million 
management makes no assurances that the estimated net realizable value of the remaining processing and related equipment can be disposed of for its recorded estimated value 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the debt component of the company s convertible notes is accreted to the face value of the notes using the effective interest rate method over the expected life of the notes  with the resulting charge recorded as interest expense 
the expected life of the notes is an estimate and is subject to change  if warranted by facts and circumstances related to the potential early redemption of the notes by either the company or the holders 
at december   we revised our estimate of the expected life of the notes to june  and adjusted the carrying value accordingly 
see consolidated balance sheets convertible notes and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adjusted carrying value was calculated by computing the present value of estimated future interest and principal payments at t he original effective interest rate 
as a result of this change  the carrying value of the notes increased by approximately million with a corresponding increase in capitalized interest and accretion 
the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
future tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and those amounts reported in the financial statements 
the future tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the differences are expected to be settled 
future tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be realized 
we operate and file tax returns in a number of jurisdictions 
the preparation of such tax filings requires considerable judgment and the use of assumptions 
accordingly  the amounts reported could vary in the future 
see consolidated statements of operations income tax expense 
the company uses the fair value method of accounting for stock options 
the fair value is computed using the black scholes method which utilizes estimates that affect the amounts ultimately recorded as stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
through  the company re measured its bolivar denominated transactions at the official exchange rate of bs 

in  based on new guidance from the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa international practices task force iptf  the company concluded that the parallel market rate was the most appropriate rate to use to re measure bolivar transactions 
accordingly  in the company began to use the average rate received in the parallel market to re measure bolivar transactions and at december   used the parallel rate to translate bolivar denominated monetary items 
on january  the venezuelan government modified the currency  fixing the official exchange rate at bs 
to us 
in january  the official rate was adjusted to bs 
to us for most goods and services and bs 
to us for certain priority items such as basic foods and medicines 
in late  the venezuelan economy was determined to be highly inflationary 
after consideration of the recent events with respect to the venezuelan currency and economy  the company continues to believe that it is most appropriate to use the parallel rate to re measure transactions and to translate bs 
denominated monetary items 
significant accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the more significant accounting policies are as follows financial instruments 
effective january   the company adopted cica section this section requires entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate a the significance of financial instruments for the entity s financial position and performance  and b the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the balance sheet date  and how the entity manages those risks 
stock based compensation 
we use the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors 
consideration paid for shares on exercise of share options in addition to the fair value attributable to stock options granted is credited to capital stock 
exploration and development costs 
exploration costs incurred in locating areas of potential mineralization are expensed as incurred 
exploration costs of properties or working interests with specific areas of potential mineralization are capitalized at cost pending the determination of a property s economic viability 
development costs of proven mining properties not yet producing are capitalized at cost and classified as property  plant and equipment 
property holding costs are charged to operations during the period if no significant exploration or development activities are being conducted on the related properties 
upon commencement of production  capitalized exploration and development costs will be amortized based on the estimated proven and probable reserves benefited 
properties which are abandoned are written off and properties determined to be impaired are written down to the estimated fair value 
interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use 
measurement uncertainty 
any operations we may have are subject to the effects of changes in legal  tax and regulatory regimes  political  labor and economic developments  social and political unrest  currency and exchange controls  import export restrictions and government bureaucracy in the countries in which we operate 
subsequent to the expropriation and the resulting loss of control and physical access to the brisas project  we recorded a million non cash write off of the carrying value of the expropriated assets including an adjustment for the estimated net realizable value of certain processing and related equipment purchased for the brisas project of approximately million 
the realizable value of the remaining processing and related equipme nt may be different than management s current estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company operates and files tax returns in a number of jurisdictions 
the preparation of such tax filings requires considerable judgment and the use of assumptions 
accordingly  the amounts reported could vary in the future 
internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
we believe that internal controls over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated  can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are met 
there have been no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the twelve months ended december  that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  the company s internal control over financial reporting 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our total financial resources  which include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  were approximately million compared to million at december  the company s cash and investments are held primarily is us dollar denominated accounts 
cash and cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities total overall financial resources decreased approximately million from december  this decrease was primarily due to expenditures for property  plant and equipment of approximately million relating to our purchase commitments for the brisas project  capitalized interest related to the convertible notes of approximately and approximately million used by operations more fully described below in results of operations  offset by approximately million from sales of equipment 
as of march  we held approximately million in cash  restricted cash and investments  including restricted cash of approximately million held pursuant to a letter of credit for certain equipment purchase commitments 
with the write off of the capitalized costs associated with our venezuelan operations  the company s net book value at december  has decreased to approximately million 
the primary future obligation of the company is the senior subordinated notes which may be settled in cash or common shares in the event the holder chooses the one time option to put the notes back to the company for repurchase on june  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  in the near term we believe that cash and investment balances and funds available from potential future equipment sales will be sufficient to enable us to fund our activities through the timing and extent of additional funding  if any  depends on a number of important factors  including  but not limited to the timing and outcome of our investment dispute with the venezuelan government  the timing and the amount of proceeds  if any  from the sale of brisas project assets  the extent of future acquisitions or investments  if any  status of the financial markets and our share price 
operating activities cash flow used by operating activities for was approximately million  which was an increase over of approximately million 
although management was successful at reducing certain operating expenses as noted below in results of operations  we utilized approximately million in to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses  the bulk of which related to the cost of defending the company against the hostile take over offer by rusoro mining ltd 
investing activities purchase of property  plant and equipment net purchase of proceeds from marketable securities proceeds from sale of equipment decrease increase in restricted cash  capitalized interest paid on convertible debt  other investing activities during the months ended december  included net investment in property  plant and equipment of approximately million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these payments primarily relate to obligations related to the equipment orders for brisas originally totaling approximately million 
in  net purchases of marketable securities totaled approximately million compared to net proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in marketable securities primarily relates to investments in debt securities in an effort to improve the overall rate of return on invested cash 
as a result of the april revocation of the authorization to affect  the venezuelan government s inability to clearly articulate  at that time  its intentions related to brisas and the uncertainty of the future time schedule  the board of directors  in early  authorized management to evaluate the sale or a redeployment to an alternative project of all or a portion of the equipment previously ordered for brisas 
in and  we sold certain equipment one sag mill  two ball mills  tonne per day through put and related motors as well as mobile equipment originally costing approximately million 
the company recovered approximately million of progress payments and the purchaser assumed the remaining payment obligations of approximately million resulting in a combined loss on sale of equipment of approximately million 
as of december   the company had remaining equipment purchase commitments of approximately million due in relating to previous equipment orders 
in connection with a portion of these commitments  we opened an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a canadian chartered bank providing security on the performance of obligations and secured by cash 
as of december  and  the company had restricted cash of million and million  respectively as required by this letter of credit 
the million reduction of restricted cash during was the result of million of payments and a million release of collateral related to the cancellation of a portion of the equipment 
similarly  changes in and were a result of progress payments for equipment commitments and the origination of the commitment  respectively 
the company capitalized interest related to the convertible notes until october when we lost control and physical access to the brisas project 
the reduction in over that recorded in relates to the amounts that were incurred subsequent to october which were expensed in the period incurred 
financing activities net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes net proceeds from issuance of common shares extinguishment of convertible notes in may we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due june  and  class a common shares at per share cdn per share for approximately million for a combined total of approximately million before expenses and fees 
although the convertible notes have a face value of million  they are recorded on the balance sheet at approximately million as canadian accounting standards require the company to allocate the proceeds from the notes between their equity and debt components based on their respective fair values at the time of issuance 
the convertible notes are due in june the holders  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  have a one time option to require the company to repurchase the notes on june   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the repurchase of the notes for cash would require substantial funds and this option may not occur if we lack sufficient liquidity at that time 
as a result  we may elect to satisfy our obligation to pay the repurchase price  in whole or in part  by delivering common shares 
if in the future we elect to repurchase the notes with common shares  we would be required to issue shares based on the share price on june   which will likely result in significant dilution to existing shareholders and a potential change of control of the company 
the convertible notes are trading in the gray market often at a significant discount to face value 
as the terms of the indenture provide that the company may repurchase the convertible notes in open market purchases or negotiated transactions  the board of directors authorized management to repurchase a portion of the outstanding convertible debt 
as of december   we had re purchased approximately million face value of convertible notes 
management continues to explore broader efforts to redeem a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
these efforts could include a public offer to reacquire all or a portion of the notes or a more limited dutch auction or individual private transactions 
the time and extent of such plans will be influenced by  among other things  terms of the indenture  regulatory issues  market conditions and available cash 
the covenants contained in the subordinated note indenture are limited to administrative issues such as payments of interest  maintenance of office or agency location  delivery of reports and other related issues 
likewise  events of default are defined as failure to pay interest and principal amounts when due  default in the performance of covenants  failure to convert notes upon holder s exercise of conversion rights and similar provisions or the company s failure to give notice of a fundamental change which is generally defined as events related to a change of control in the company 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information on the company s material contractual obligation payments for the periods indicated as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years convertible notes  nbs p  equipment contracts  total  nbsp  in may  the company issued  aggregate principal amount of its convertible notes 
the notes pay interest semi annually and are due on june  subject to certain conditions  the notes may be converted into class a common shares of the company  redeemed or repurchased 
the note holders have the option to require the company to repurchase the notes on june   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the company may elect to satisfy its obligation to pay the repurchase price  in whole or in part  by delivering common shares 
in the event of a change of control of the company  the company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but unpaid interest unless there has occurred and is continuing certain events of default under the company s indenture 
at any time on or after june   and until june   the company may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest if the closing sale price of the common shares is equal to or greater than of the conversion price then in effect and the closing price for the company s common shares has remained above that price for at least trading days in the period of trading days preceding the company s notice of redemption 
beginning on june   the company may  at its option  redeem all or part of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as of december    face value of convertible notes have been settled in cash or repurchased by the company at a total cost of  the amounts shown above include the interest and principal payments due based on the estimate that the term of the notes will end on june  if the notes were to reach their contractual maturity date of june   additional interest payments would amount to million over the additional ten year term of the notes 
the company originally placed orders totaling million for the fabrication of processing equipment  mobile equipment and other mining equipment and related engineering 
in july and november  the company sold a portion of this equipment recovering million in deposits and reducing our future commitment by million 
as of december   the company has equipment orders totaling million and has made payments on these orders of million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations prior to  we re measured our bolivar denominated transactions at the official exchange rate 
in  based on guidance from the aicpa s iptf  we concluded that the parallel market rate was the most appropriate rate to use to re measure bolivar denominated transactions 
the iptf continues to review the advisability of using the parallel rate and in the absence of more or new definitive guidance  we continue to use the parallel rate 
if we were to change the method of re measuring bolivar denominated transactions it may have an effect on the company s future results of operations 
as a result of the expropriation of the brisas project by the venezuelan government and our loss of control and physical access to the project  we recorded a million non cash write off of the carrying value of the expropriated assets  including affected equipment on order of approximately million 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a cost reduction program in response to the delays being experienced in venezuela and the subsequent actions by the venezuelan government 
our results of operation for the twelve months ended december   and are a product of an extraordinary loss on expropriation of assets  operating expenses related to the management of brisas including legal and arbitration costs associated with the brisas investment dispute with venezuelan government  takeover defense costs and loss on disposal of equipment  net of interest income and gains on the disposition of marketable securities  extinguishment of debt and foreign currency

in addition  the change in net loss was also due to an increase in other income of approximately million  reductions in operating expenses of approximately million and costs associated with the takeover defense and litigation of approximately million  and increases in loss on sale of equipment of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million 
interest income for the month period ended december  decreased from the comparable period primarily due to substantially reduced rates of return on invested cash and to a lesser extent  lower levels of invested cash 
the gain on the extinguishment of debt was due to the re purchase of approximately million face value of the company s convertible notes at a substantial discount 
the increase in gain on sale of securities is a result of non recurring investment transactions during the period reported 
excluding the extraordinary loss on the expropriation of assets  expenses in amounted to million compared with million in  a million reduction 
as a result of an effort to reduce controllable costs  we cut general and administrative  technical services and corporate communications expense by approximately million which was comprised primarily of reductions related to both the number of personnel and compensation related items  fees associated with consultants  costs associated with efforts related to the brisas project debt financing and  to a lesser extent  the cumulative sum of reductions of other operating expenses 
these decreases have been supplemented by a decline in takeover defense costs of approximately million  but offset by an increase in loss on the sale of equipment of approximately million  an increase in legal and accounting expense of approximately million  primarily related to arbitration costs  and an increase in interest expense of approximately million as a result of no longer capitalizing interest expense subsequent to the date we filed for arbitration with icsid 
we expect the trend of further reducing general and administrative  technical services and corporate communications expense to continue along with future increases in expenses associated with the execution of our arbitration efforts 
compared to consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million or per share  an increase of approximately million from the change in net loss was primarily a result of a decrease in other income of approximately million and operating expenses of approximately million and an increase in costs associated with the takeover defense and litigation of approximately million and loss on sale of equipment of approximately million 
interest income for the month period ended december  decreased by million from the comparable period primarily due to substantially reduced rates of return on invested cash and to a lesser extent  lower levels of invested cash 
the loss on sale of marketable securities of million in compared to a million gain on sale of marketable securities reported in accounted for the remaining reduction in other income for the comparable periods 
overall  expenses in amounted to million compared with million in  a million increase 
we cut general and administrative expense by approximately million which was comprised primarily of reductions related to compensation expense  fees associated with bank financing efforts and other general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was offset by increases in other operating expenses including legal costs associated with the initial stages of filing for arbitration  changes in foreign currency gain losses  approximately million of expenses attributable to defending against the unsolicited takeover offer from rusoro mining ltd 
and loss on the sale of equipment of approximately million as well as the impact of changes in minority interest and income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  deposits  advances and other  accrued interest and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these instruments 
fair value estimates are made at the balance sheet date based on relevant market information but involve uncertainties and therefore cannot be determined with precision the company currently does not enter into any hedging transactions 
the company is exposed to various risks including credit risk  liquidity risk  currency risk and interest rate risk as described below a credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to meet its obligations to the company 
the company s primary exposure to credit risk is through its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances 
the company diversifies its cash holdings into major canadian and us financial institutions and corporations 
b liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
the company manages this risk by maintaining adequate cash balances through equity and debt offerings to meet its current and foreseeable obligations 
the following table presents the company s payments due on accounts payable and accrued expenses and its undiscounted interest and principal payments due on its convertible notes  based on the estimate that the term of the notes will end on june  if the notes were to reach their contractual maturity date of june   additional interest payments would amount to million over the additional ten year term of the notes 
payments due by period less than n bsp  more than total year years years years a p and accruals  interest  principal  total   c the company is subject to currency risk mainly due to its operations in venezuela 
transactions denominated in foreign currency are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which have an impact on the statement of operations 
the company s cash  value added tax and other monetary assets and liabilities that are held in venezuelan and canadian currency are subject to fluctuations against the us dollar 
a weakening of those currencies against the us dollar would have increased decreased the company s net loss from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial instruments  as at december  and  by the amounts shown below 
nbs p  venezuelan bol var canadian dollar total nbsp  the company limits the amount of currency held in non u 
s dollar accounts  but does not actively use derivative instruments to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
d the company is subject to the risk that changes in market interest rates will cause fluctuations in the fair values of its financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents earn floating market rates of interest 
other current financial assets and liabilities are generally not exposed to this risk because of their immediate or short term maturity 
the interest rate on the company s convertible notes is fixed and therefore the interest payments are not subject to changes in market rates of interest
