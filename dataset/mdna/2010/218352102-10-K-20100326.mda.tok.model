table of contents medical education and commercialization we are planning for the commercialization of corlux 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a marketing and sales force or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our products 
we intend to develop our own medical affairs and commercialization infrastructure in the united states for corlux because we believe that the initial markets for cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression in the united states are highly concentrated and accessible 
we intend to engage a partner to commercialize corlux in territories outside of the united states 
if approved  we expect to hire a small  experienced field sales force  supported by medical affairs and other infrastructure  to sell corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
we intend to focus on patients who are in the care of an endocrinologist and in active treatment for their disease 
we estimate that there are fewer than endocrinologists who would need to be targeted to reach the cushing s syndrome population in active treatment 
we plan to reach out directly to patients utilizing web based initiatives and interactions with patient groups 
we expect distribution and logistical support to be provided by specialty pharmacies 
a large portion of the people who suffer from cushing s syndrome remain unrecognized or undertreated 
we intend to develop programs to educate the medical community about early diagnosis of this syndrome and increase awareness regarding corlux 
if approved for the treatment of psychotic depression  we plan to reach patients who are candidates for ect by marketing to hospitals and psychiatrists that perform ect 
we estimate that there are approximately hospitals with more than in patient psychiatric beds 
of these  we estimate that approximately offer ect 
we believe that approximately psychiatrists administer most ect procedures 
subsequently  we also intend to expand our commercialization efforts to address the larger set of patients with psychotic depression currently undergoing combination drug therapy  which would require an increase in the size of our initial sales force 
as with cushing s syndrome  a large portion of the people who suffer from psychotic depression remain unrecognized or undertreated 
we intend to develop programs to educate the medical community about early diagnosis of psychotic depression and increase awareness regarding corlux as a treatment for this disorder 
manufacturing as a drug development entity  we intend to continue to utilize our financial resources to complete the development of corlux and advance other product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing our own manufacturing facilities 
we intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates 
we have entered into manufacturing agreements with two contract manufacturers  produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas and scinopharm taiwan scinopharm  to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient api for corlux 
the agreement with pcas  which was executed in early november  is for an initial period of five years with an automatic extension for one additional year unless either party gives twelve month s prior notice that it does not want the extension 
there is no guaranteed minimum purchase commitment under this agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement 
the agreement with scinopharm obligates us to purchase at least  of bulk mifepristone per year following the commercial launch of corlux 
this agreement is terminable by either party at any time 
we have also entered into an agreement with another contract manufacturer  pharmaform  llc  for the production of corlux tablets for use in clinical activities 
to date  our need for corlux tablets has been limited to the amounts required to support our clinical trials 

table of contents competition if approved for commercial use as a treatment for cushing s syndrome or the psychotic features of psychotic depression  corlux will compete with established treatments  including other potential compounds under development for cushing s syndrome or  in the case of psychotic depression  with ect and combination drug therapy 
we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a clinical trial in europe and the united states 
if this product is approved for commercialization before corlux  our potential future revenue could be reduced 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories received orphan drug designation for cushing s syndrome in europe  but they have stated that they have not yet conducted any clinical trials 
we may also experience competition from novartis  which is developing a somatostatin analogue  pasireotide  that is in phase trials for various endocrine disorders  including cushing s disease  which is a subset of the patients with cushing s syndrome 
ect has been shown to be the most effective treatment for psychotic depression  but it carries the risks of general anesthesia  potential memory loss and other adverse effects as well as the stigma associated with the procedure 
use of corlux does not require anesthesia and  in our clinical trials conducted to date  patients treated with corlux have not exhibited the adverse effects associated with ect 
other competitors include companies that market antipsychotic drugs that are used off label as part of combination drug therapy for psychotic depression 
to reduce the psychotic features of psychotic depression  these drugs generally are taken in combination with antidepressant medication over a period of weeks to several months 
unlike the use of corlux  this extended course of treatment may put patients at risk of significant adverse side effects  including weight gain  diabetes  sedation  permanent movement disorders and sexual dysfunction 
antipsychotics include bristol myers squibb s abilify  novartis clozaril  pfizer s geodon and navane  ortho mcneil s haldol  janssen pharmaceutica s risperdal  astrazeneca s seroquel  glaxosmithkline s stelazine and thorazine  mylan s mellaril  schering corporation s trilafon and eli lilly s zyprexa 
we are aware of one clinical trial that has taken place  conducted by the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  a division of schering plough  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
this medicine is a gr ii antagonist  the commercial use of which would be covered by our patent 
in  akzo nobel filed an observation in our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression  in which akzo nobel challenged the claims of that patent application 
in  we filed a rebuttal to akzo nobel s observation 
in february  the european patent office epo allowed our patent application 
in july  the patent was issued 
we are not aware of any public disclosures by any company  other than akzo nobel  regarding the development of new medicinal products to treat psychotic depression 
however  other companies may be developing new drug products to treat psychotic depression and the other conditions we are exploring 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms 
most of our competitors have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
many colleges  universities and public and private research organizations are also active in the human health care field 
while these entities focus on education  they may develop or acquire proprietary technology that we may require for the development of our product candidates 
we may attempt to obtain licenses to this proprietary technology 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our product candidates  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our future products either alone or through outside parties 

table of contents intellectual property patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions  and to rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
under an agreement with stanford university  we have licensed exclusive rights to the following issued us patents and any corresponding foreign patents us patent number subject matter expiration date  use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of cocaine induced psychosis october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of early dementia february  we are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to stanford university on sales of products commercialized under any of the above patents 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
if stanford university were to terminate any of our exclusive licenses due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
we also own issued us patents for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment  for the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication  for the prevention and treatment of stress disorders  for increasing the therapeutic response to ect  for the treatment of delirium  for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and for inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with down s syndrome 
in addition  we have eight us method of use patent applications covering certain gr ii antagonists  including the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders by optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum  postpartum psychosis  neurological damage in premature infants  catatonia  migraine headaches  psychosis associated with interferon alpha therapy  depression in patients taking interleukin il and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als 
we have composition of matter claims on three patent families of novel selective gr ii antagonists 
applications for all of the three families have been allowed in europe 
in the united states  applications for two of the three families have been allowed 
examination has not yet begun in the united states on our third novel selective gr ii antagonist family 

table of contents we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications or that competitors will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued 
although two of our patents and one of our patent applications have claims directed to the composition of compounds  we do not have a patent with claims directed to the composition of mifepristone 
our rights under our issued patents related to mifepristone cover only the use of that compound in the treatment of specific diseases 
the patent covering the product mifepristone has expired 
the only fda approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy 
the fda has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and may impose restrictions on corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we plan to rely on the scope of our use patent  the restrictions imposed by the fda on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and the different patient populations  administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression 
the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain  involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation 
our product candidates may give rise to claims that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others 
if it is determined that our drug candidates infringe on others patent rights  we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights 
if we fail to obtain licenses when necessary  we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents  or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all 
if we do become involved in intellectual property litigation  we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation 
we believe that we do not currently infringe any third party s patents or other proprietary rights  and we are not obligated to pay royalties to any third party other than stanford university 
in november  mclean hospital had alleged that it also had rights to the technology that led to the patent for the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
mclean hospital was a prior employer of one of our founders  dr 
alan schatzberg and it alleged that the invention of the technology underlying this patent was conceived by dr 
schatzberg and or dr 
anthony rothschild while the two were employed by mclean hospital 
we contended that the invention was actually conceived by dr 
schatzberg and dr 
joseph belanoff while they were employed by stanford university and that the patent was appropriately assigned by them to stanford university 
in october  we announced a resolution of this issue in which we retained our exclusive rights under the patent and which required us to make no additional payments under the license  regardless of the resolution of the impending inventorship dispute 
in january  the inventorship issue was resolved in favor of stanford university 
as discussed earlier under competition  in akzo nobel filed an observation to the grant of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
we are not aware of any other disputes related to patent issues 
license agreement under our exclusive license agreement with stanford university to patents covering the use of corlux to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of early dementia  we are required to pay stanford  annually as a nonrefundable royalty payment 
this payment is creditable against future royalties 
we are also obligated to pay stanford a  milestone upon the filing of the nda for corlux 
table of contents for the treatment of psychotic depression and a further  milestone payment upon fda approval of corlux 
the milestone payments are also creditable against future royalties 
this license agreement expires upon expiration of the related patents or upon notification by us to stanford 
government regulation prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of the products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization 
the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing  submission of an ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic s intended use  and  in the case of a new drug  approval by the fda of an nda 
the process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations in order to obtain the necessary approvals and subsequently complying with federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense 
preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product 
drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the fda as a part of an ind  which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans 
typically  human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
phase clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers 
phase clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the drug and to provide enough data to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product  as required by the fda 
the fda and the institutional review boards closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the united states and may reevaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda may also require that additional studies be conducted  such as studies demonstrating that the drug being tested does not cause cancer 
after phase trials are completed  drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies  clinical trials  formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the fda in the form of an nda for approval to commence commercial sales 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
if the fda accepts an nda for filing  they may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet regulatory approval criteria 
fda approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fda approves an nda  the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the united states 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post market regulatory standards is not maintained 
the drug developer must submit periodic reports to the fda 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with 
table of contents safety or efficacy occur after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies  to monitor the effect of approved products  and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post market studies 
facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities where applicable  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations cgmp 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
with respect to post market product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  a drug developer may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications 
the purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 
data supporting the use of a drug for these new indications must be submitted to the fda in a new or supplemental nda that must be approved by the fda before the drug can be marketed for the new indications 
approvals outside the united states 
we have not started the regulatory approval process in any jurisdiction other than the united states and we are unable to estimate when  if ever  we will commence the regulatory approval process in any foreign jurisdiction 
we or our partners will have to complete an approval process similar to the us approval process in foreign target markets for our product candidates before we can commercialize our product candidates in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional testing 
foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
the prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return to us 
orphan drug designation 
the fda has granted us orphan drug designation for corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
the designation provides special status to a product to treat a rare disease or condition providing that the product meets certain criteria 
orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the orphan drug act 
a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition 
fast track designation 
the fda sometimes grants fast track status under the food and drug administration modernization act of the fast track mechanism was created to facilitate the development and approval of new drugs intended for the treatment of life threatening conditions for which there are no effective treatments and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition 
the fast track process includes scheduling of meetings to seek fda input into development plans  the option of submitting an nda serially in sections rather than submitting all components simultaneously  the option to request evaluation of studies using surrogate endpoints  and the potential for a priority review 

table of contents we have been granted fast track status for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
however  the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda at any time 
the fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that corlux will receive regulatory approval 
priority review 
the fda has indicated to us that it will grant us a priority review of our nda of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression if no other medications have been approved for this indication at the time of our submission 
employees we are managed by a core group of experienced pharmaceutical executives with a track record of bringing new drugs to market 
to facilitate advancement of development programs  we also enlist the expertise of associates and advisors with extensive pharmaceutical development experience 
as of december   we had full time employees  three part time employees and long term contract staff 
four of our employees are mds we consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves significant risks 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k  including our financial statements and related notes  before you decide to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us  however  they may not be the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate  corlux  currently being developed for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
if we are unable to commercialize corlux for cushing s syndrome or for psychotic depression  or experience significant delays in doing so  we may be unable to generate revenues and our stock price will likely decline 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we currently do not have any commercial products and we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenues and achieve profitability will be solely dependent on the successful development  approval and commercialization of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or for the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we are conducting a single phase trial in cushing s syndrome and a phase clinical trial in psychotic depression 
we have previously completed three phase clinical trials evaluating corlux for psychotic depression  all of which failed to achieve statistically significant results with regard to the primary or key secondary endpoints 
many factors could harm our efforts to develop and commercialize corlux  including insufficient funding  negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from our pre clinical or clinical development programs  side effects that may be identified in the course of our clinical trials  changes or delays in our clinical development program  rapid technological change making corlux obsolete  competition from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours  increases in the costs of our clinical trials  an inability to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approval for the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  an inability to manufacture corlux or the active ingredient in corlux in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost  and political concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone  or ru  that could limit the market acceptance of corlux 

table of contents our clinical trials may not demonstrate that corlux is safe and effective 
if our clinical program for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for any other indications does not demonstrate safety and efficacy  our business will be harmed 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda to market corlux  our phase clinical trials must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the particular indication 
our first three phase studies evaluating corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression did not meet their primary or key secondary endpoints 
in addition to the ongoing phase clinical trials of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we will need to conduct other studies in support of a potential nda 
clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays  and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
while we obtained favorable results in our phase clinical trials in psychotic depression  these results were not replicated in a robust enough way in our completed phase clinical trials and are not sufficient to use by themselves as the pivotal clinical trials in an application for fda approval of this indication 
in addition  we cannot assure you that supportive studies and tests will produce favorable results 
the development plan for corlux  or any other compound  is not certain 
if we decide to  or if the fda or other regulatory agencies require us to pursue additional clinical trials or other studies  there may be a delay in the development of our compounds  which may have a negative impact on our business 
during the development of corlux  we have been engaged in dialogue with the fda to determine an acceptable development plan which would enable the fda to complete its review in a satisfactory manner 
we anticipate continued dialogue with the fda to define any additional data needed to complete an nda 
we may decide  or the fda or other regulatory authorities may require us  to pursue additional clinical  pre clinical or manufacturing studies to satisfactorily complete our nda for either cushing s syndrome or psychotic depression 
for example  the fda may require us to perform a bioequivalance study comparing our recently reformulated corlux clinical trial materials to the materials used in our earlier clinical trials in psychotic depression 
additional trials or studies will require additional funding which is not assured 
also  it is possible that additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable will delay or prevent the completion of the development of corlux for treating cushing s syndrome or the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
many other factors could delay or result in termination of our clinical trials  including  but not limited to availability of funding  negative or inconclusive results  slow patient enrollment  patient noncompliance with the protocol  adverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials  negative or problematic fda inspections of our clinical operations or our manufacturing operations  and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of corlux 
even after we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate for an optimal nda  we may not receive regulatory approval to market corlux 

table of contents we will need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of corlux and our other proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  including cort additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms  which could adversely effect our business 
we may have to perform additional clinical trials prior to submission of an nda for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we may need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and will need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression 
in addition  we will need to raise additional funds to prepare for the commercialization of corlux for either of these indications  to develop a product for weight gain management associated with antipsychotic medications  and to continue and expand the development of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  including cort we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan into early however  our expectations are based on our currently planned clinical development and research programs for corlux and for certain of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  including cort  which may change as a result of many factors  including the costs  timing of site selection and enrollment of our clinical trials  the results of our research efforts and clinical trials  the need to perform additional clinical trials and other supportive studies  the need to establish a second source for corlux tableting  the timing of the approval by the fda  if any  to market corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including announcements of claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in our growth rates  changes in our research development plans for our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  including cort  the timing of commercialization of corlux and future product candidates  and changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
even though we raised approximately million in october  through a private placement of our common stock and warrants  and generated an additional  between october and january under our committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  market and economic conditions may make it difficult for us to raise any additional capital 
the sales of common stock and warrants during and the first quarter of have been dilutive to stockholders and any exercise of outstanding warrants and additional equity financing will cause further dilution to stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise 
table of contents seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for at least the next few years 
we are a development stage company with no current source of product revenue 
we have a limited history of operations and have focused primarily on clinical trials  and if the outcome of our clinical trials supports it  we plan to seek fda regulatory clearance to market corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
subject to our ability to raise additional funds  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with the clinical trials and other development activities for corlux and for other product candidates 
we expect to incur significant expenses related to the preparation for commercializing corlux and for the product s launch  if the fda approves our nda 
as a result  we expect that our losses will increase at least until corlux is launched and commercially available to patients 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable 
the committed equity financing facility ceff that we entered into with kingsbridge in march may not be available to us at certain times  may generate a lower level of funding than we anticipate  may require us to make additional blackout or other payments to kingsbridge  and will result in dilution to our stockholders 
kingsbridge will not be obligated to purchase shares under the ceff unless certain conditions are met  which include a minimum price for our common stock  currently set at per share and the effectiveness and continued effectiveness of the resale registration statements 
the actual amount of funds that can be raised under this agreement will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of our stock during the pricing periods of each sale 
in june  the sec declared effective our registration statement with the sec covering the resale of approximately million of the shares issuable under the ceff and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
this registration statement covers approximately of the million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff and all of the  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
we intend to file an additional registration statement covering the resale of the remaining shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff days after kingsbridge and its affiliates have resold substantially all of the securities covered by this initial registration statement  therefore  the timing of the submission of this subsequent registration statement is uncertain 
this subsequent registration statement may be subject to review and comment by the staff of the sec  as well as consent by our independent registered accounting firm 
we cannot assure you that these registration statements will be declared effective or  if declared effective  that they will remain continuously effective thereafter 
in addition  kingsbridge is permitted to terminate the ceff if it determines that a material and adverse event has occurred affecting our business  operations  properties or financial condition and if such condition continues for a period of days from the date kingsbridge provides us notice of such material and adverse event 
if we are unable to access funds through the ceff  or if the ceff is terminated by kingsbridge  we may be unable to access alternative capital on favorable terms or at all 
we are entitled in certain circumstances  to deliver a blackout notice to kingsbridge to suspend the use of the resale registration statement and prohibit kingsbridge from selling shares thereunder 
if we deliver a blackout notice in the trading days following the settlement of a draw down  or if the resale registration statement is not 
table of contents effective in circumstances not permitted by our agreement with kingsbridge  then we may be required to make a payment to kingsbridge  or issue kingsbridge additional shares in lieu of the payment 
if the trading price of our common stock declines during a suspension of the resale registration statement  the blackout or other payment could be significant 
any shares that we may issue to kingsbridge under the ceff will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current stockholders  and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
for each draw down under the ceff  we will issue shares to kingsbridge at a discount of up to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the ceff when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing  and may further decrease our share price 
we may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to secure adequate funding for these programs 
the costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allow us to consider for further development are collectively greater than the funds currently available to us 
for example  we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are specific gr ii antagonists but  unlike corlux  do not appear to block the progesterone receptor 
further development of these proprietary compounds  including cort  or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that such development may jeopardize our ability to complete the clinical development of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or psychotic depression 
global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
global economic and market conditions were extremely unstable in  with significantly tighter credit conditions 
any economic recovery during could be fragile and uneven 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential wide spread and long term recession  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  global financial markets and corporate  consumer and governmental debt levels have contributed to market volatility and diminished expectations for the us  european and other economies 
as a result of these conditions  the cost and availability of capital have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
concern about the stability of the markets generally  and the strength of counterparties specifically  has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide credit to businesses 
continued turbulence in the global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
if these market and economic conditions continue  they may limit our ability to fund our clinical trials and drug development programs 
in addition  our access to funds under our ceff or any credit facility into which we may enter depends on the ability of the counterparties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us 
we cannot assure you that continuing long term disruptions in the global economy and tighter credit conditions will not have an adverse effect on such counterparties 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow funds  access our ceff or raise equity capital  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  curtailing clinical or drug development activity  which would have an adverse affect on our business and results of operation 

table of contents we depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis  and  as a result  we may face costs and delays outside of our control 
we rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis 
however  we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials 
if our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedules  we will be unable to complete our trials or to complete them as planned  which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of corlux or other development programs 
we have an agreement with a contract research organization cro that is conducting our ongoing phase trial evaluating corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  to supervise and monitor clinical site performance and to perform investigator supervision  data collection and analysis for this trial 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with this or other cros or with the clinical investigators and the clinical sites through the completion of all trial activities without delays in anticipated timing of trial activities or excessive expenditures 
our agreements place substantial responsibilities on these parties  which could result in excessive expenditures for our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected 
for example  if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with fda approved good clinical practices  we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites 
if these cros  clinical investigators  clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize  corlux 
the conduct of any future clinical trials will likely also be conducted through the use of cros and clinical research sites 
the conduct  timing and cost of these trials will be subject to the same kinds of risks as discussed above 
our use of medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services in study  our ongoing clinical trial evaluating corlux for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  may not result in any improvement in the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments and may continue to slow the pace of enrollment in study in connection with our ongoing phase trial evaluating corlux for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  we engaged medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services 
medavante is providing centralized psychometric assessments via high resolution video conferencing 
the use of medavante s centralized rating services is expected to increase the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments 
medavante has provided similar centralized rating services to companies conducting clinical studies in various psychiatric disorders 
however  they have not previously provided centralized rating services to any study in patients with psychotic depression 
although corcept and medavante conducted a small pilot evaluation in patients with psychotic depression to assess patient receptivity  we cannot be certain that centralized rating will be successful in the patients enrolled in our study 
if patients are uncomfortable or unwilling to participate in the centralized rating process or if medavante is unable to provide services in a satisfactory manner over the course of the trial  we may not see any improvement in the accuracy or reliability of the psychiatric assessments 
such a result might diminish the likelihood of a successful trial or a definitive demonstration of the efficacy of corlux in treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 

table of contents during screening for study  we have seen a higher than anticipated incidence of potential patients who do not meet appropriate criteria for entrance into the trial for diagnostic and other clinical reasons 
we believe that this is the result of improved accuracy in the screening process resulting from the use of the medavante centralized rating services as an additional step in the selection of patients appropriate for inclusion in the study 
in addition  in march  we announced that  in order to lower variable and fixed expenses and to conserve financial resources  we scaled back our planned rate of spending on this trial and extended the timeline for its completion 
we are currently using eight clinical sites in order to conserve capital 
a continued lower enrollment rate could result in delays in the timing of anticipated completion of the trial and increased study costs over the longer term 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our product candidates  including corlux  and our business will be harmed 
the research  testing  manufacturing  selling and marketing of product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  in which regulations differ from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval typically is an uncertain process  is costly and takes many years 
in addition  failure to comply with the fda and other applicable foreign and us regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these include warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending ndas  or supplements to approved ndas 
regulatory approval of an nda or nda supplement is never guaranteed 
despite the time  resources and effort expended  failure can occur at any stage 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process for human medicines 
the fda can deny  delay or limit approval of a product candidate for many reasons including the fda may not find that the candidate is safe  the fda may not find data from the clinical or preclinical testing to be sufficient  or the fda may not approve our or our third party manufacturers processes or facilities 
future governmental action or changes in fda policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an nda in the united states 
in addition  because the only currently fda approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy  we expect that the label for corlux will include some limitations  including a warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  including corlux  we will also be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may not be permitted to market our product candidates 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda approves any of our product candidates  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping for the medicine will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the medicine  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the medicine  and could include withdrawal of the medicine from the market 

table of contents failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from commercializing our product candidates abroad 
we intend to commercialize our product candidates in international markets with the help of one or more partners 
outside the united states  we can commercialize a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in some cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process  and  in some cases  additional risks 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
we have not taken any actions to obtain foreign approvals 
we may not develop our product candidates in the clinic in order to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market 
the orphan drug designation for corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome may not provide protection from competition and other benefits as anticipated 
in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
although we have received orphan drug designation from the fda  we cannot be assured that we will recognize the potential benefits of this designation 
for example  we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a phase clinical trial in europe and the united states for this indication 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories recently received a recommendation for orphan drug designation for cushing s syndrome in europe  but they have stated that they have not yet conducted any clinical trials 
if another drug is approved for this indication before corlux  we may not garner the seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval and other benefits that we anticipate 
the fast track designation for the development program of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process 
if a human medicine is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the medicine demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition  the sponsor of an ind may apply for fda fast track designation for a particular indication 
marketing applications submitted by sponsors of product candidates in fast track development may qualify for expedited fda review under the policies and procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification 
although we have obtained a fast track designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we may not experience a faster development process  review or approval compared to applications considered for approval under conventional fda procedures 
in addition  the fda may withdraw our fast track designation at any time 
if we lose our fast track designation  the approval process may be delayed 
in addition  our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that corlux will receive regulatory approval for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 

table of contents even if we receive approval for the marketing and sale of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and or psychotic depression  corlux may never be accepted as a treatment for the approved indications  which would adversely effect our financial results 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and or the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for any other approved indication 
even if the fda approves corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  or for any other indication  physicians may not adopt corlux 
physicians will recommend the use of corlux only if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect profiles and other factors  that it is preferable to other products or treatments then in use 
acceptance of corlux among influential practitioners may be essential for market acceptance of corlux 
other factors that may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of corlux include the effectiveness of corlux  including any side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the product labeling or product insert required by the fda for corlux  the cost effectiveness of corlux and the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement  in particular from government payors such as medicare and medicaid  for patients using corlux  the timing of market entry of corlux relative to competitive products  the intentional restriction of distribution of corlux to physicians treating the target patient population  the extent and success of our sales and marketing efforts  the rate of adoption of corlux by physicians and by target patient population  and negative publicity concerning corlux  ru or mifepristone 
the failure of corlux to achieve market acceptance would prevent us from generating meaningful product revenue 
public perception of the active ingredient in corlux  mifepristone or ru  may limit our ability to market and sell corlux 
the active ingredient in corlux  mifepristone ru is used to terminate pregnancy 
as a result  mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the united states and elsewhere 
public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of corlux by patients and physicians 
even though we intend to create measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of corlux to a pregnant woman  physicians may decline to prescribe corlux to a woman simply to avoid altogether any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy 
we intend to create measures for controlling the distribution of corlux to reduce the potential for diversion 
however  controlled distribution may negatively impact sales of corlux 

table of contents we have no manufacturing capabilities and we currently depend on third parties to manufacture the active ingredient and the tablets for corlux 
the tablet manufacturer is a single source supplier 
if these suppliers are unable to continue manufacturing corlux and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources  our business will be harmed 
we currently have no experience in  and we do not own facilities for  nor do we plan to develop facilities for  manufacturing any products 
we have agreements with two manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of mifepristone and an agreement with a tablet manufacturer for development quantities of corlux 
the tablet manufacturer is a single source supplier to us 
our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by either party at any time 
although we anticipate engaging our current tablet supplier to produce commercial quantities of corlux  we cannot guarantee that we will enter into an agreement with them on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or corlux tablets from our contract manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture our required quantities or identify alternate manufacturers of mifepristone or corlux tablets in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all 
if our third party manufacturers of corlux fail to comply with fda regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements  our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed 
we depend on third party manufacturers to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient in corlux and to manufacture corlux tablets 
these suppliers and manufacturers must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations and guidelines 
our suppliers and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel 
their failure to follow cgmp or other regulatory requirements and to document their compliance with cgmp may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study or the termination or hold on a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for corlux 
failure of our third party suppliers and manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm our business 
if the operations of any current or future supplier or manufacturer were to become unavailable for any reason  commercialization of corlux could be delayed and our revenue from product sales could be reduced 
we may use a different third party manufacturer to produce commercial quantities of corlux than we are using in our clinical trials 
the fda may require us to conduct a study to demonstrate that the tablets used in our clinical trials are equivalent to the final commercial product 
if we are unable to establish that the tablets are equivalent or if the fda disagrees with the results of our study  commercial launch of corlux would be delayed 
if we or others identify side effects after our product candidates are on the market  we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials  change the labeling of our future products or withdraw our future products from the market  any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our product candidates are on the market regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to reformulate our future products  conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in labeling of such products or implement changes to or obtain re approvals of our manufacturing facilities  
table of contents we may experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action lawsuits 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these product candidates 
if corlux or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes  we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and other potential uses of gr ii antagonists 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage 
to date  we own seven issued us method of use patents and have exclusively licensed three issued us method of use patents  with a number of corresponding foreign patents or patent applications 
we have eight us method of use patent applications for gr ii antagonists 
we own two composition of matter patents and have one composition of matter patent application covering specific gr ii antagonists pending in the us we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we have exclusively licensed three issued us patents from stanford university for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression  which is commonly referred to as psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease 
we bear the costs of protecting and defending the rights to these patents 
in order to maintain the exclusive license to these patents until their expiration  we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to stanford university 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under this agreement 
if we become noncompliant  we may lose the right to commercialize corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia and our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  if stanford university were to terminate our corlux license due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
our patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in  akzo nobel  which was subsequently acquired by schering plough  filed an observation challenging the claims of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in  we filed a rebuttal to the epo that responded to the points raised by akzo nobel 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application and in july  this patent was issued 
in april we received notification that there will be no opposition proceedings in europe in regards to this patent 
our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
for example  the arguments presented by akzo nobel could be raised in the united states either before the us patent and trademark office or in a court of law 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued to us  or which may be issued to us in the future  may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology  which would impair our ability to compete 

table of contents if a third party were successful in asserting an infringement claim against us  we could be forced to pay damages and prevented from developing  manufacturing or marketing our potential products 
we do not have liability insurance for patent infringements 
a third party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use their intellectual property  and we may not be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
regardless of the merit of any particular claim  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  is expensive and diverts management s attention from other business 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete in the market could be diminished 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information 
nevertheless  these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if they do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our proprietary information  which could diminish our ability to compete in the market 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through means not currently foreseen 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative products that are equal or superior to our product candidates without infringing on any of our proprietary information or trade secrets 
our licensed patent covering the use of mifepristone to treat psychotic depression is a method of use patent rather than a composition of matter patent  which increases the risk that physicians will prescribe another manufacturer s mifepristone for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or psychotic depression rather than corlux or patients may acquire mifepristone from other sources  such as the internet or black market 
we have an exclusive license from stanford university to a patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists  including mifepristone  for the treatment of psychotic depression 
a method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound  not a particular composition of matter 
ten of our us issued patents and eight of our nine us patent applications are method of use patents 
because none of our issued patents covers the composition of mifepristone  we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone in indications not covered by our method of use patents 
if others receive approval to manufacture and market mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist  physicians could prescribe mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist for patients with psychotic depression instead of corlux 
although any such off label use would violate our licensed patent  effectively monitoring compliance with our licensed patent may be difficult and costly 
in addition  if others develop a treatment for psychotic depression that works through a mechanism which does not involve the gr ii receptor  physicians could prescribe that treatment instead of corlux 
in addition  we cannot be assured that patients will not obtain mifepristone from other sources 
as with other pharmaceutical products  patients may be able to purchase mifepristone through the internet or black market 
mifepristone is also sold in the united states by danco laboratories for the termination of early pregnancy 
while distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician s office and covered by other restrictions  we cannot be certain that cushing s syndrome patients may not be able to obtain mifepristone from this source 

table of contents the composition of matter patents on our families of novel selective glucocorticoid antagonists may not be issued and we would not be able to prevent competition from others 
we have filed composition of matter patent claims on three families of novel selective glucocorticoid antagonists but not all of these have been issued 
applications for all of the three families have been allowed in europe 
in the united states  applications for two of the three families have been allowed 
examination has not yet begun in the united states on our third novel selective gr ii family 
we cannot be certain that these patents will be issued to us 
if these patents are not issued we may not be able to prevent others from developing competing compounds 
the competing products could be prescribed by physicians instead of those developed by us 
our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize new product candidates beyond corlux are at a very early stage 
if we fail to identify and develop additional uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to market additional products 
to develop additional potential sources of revenue  we believe that we must identify and develop additional product candidates 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat psychotic depression  mild cognitive impairment  weight gain due to treatment with antipsychotic medication  stress disorders  early dementia  delirium  gastroesophageal reflux disease  down s syndrome and psychosis associated with cocaine addiction  and to increase the therapeutic response to ect 
in addition  we have eight us method of use patent applications covering gr ii antagonists for the treatment of a number of other metabolic and psychiatric disorders and three us composition of matter patent applications covering specific gr ii antagonists 
we have also filed patent applications in all of the major international markets 
we may not develop or continue to develop product candidates for any of the indications or compounds covered by our patents and patent applications 
typically  there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials  so our product development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products 
the use of gr ii antagonists may not be effective to treat these conditions or any other indications 
in addition  we could discover that the use of gr ii antagonists in these patient populations has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe 
we may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates 
if we do enter into such an arrangement  we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement 
any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement 
we only have significant clinical experience with corlux and we may determine that corlux is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
in that event  we would have to identify and may need to secure rights to a different gr ii antagonist 
for example  we do not intend to develop corlux for mitigation of the weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa  risperdal or other atypical antipsychotics  even though we have reported positive results in the proof of concept studies described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are pursuing other gr ii antagonists for this use and may pursue additional compounds 
the compounds developed pursuant to our preclinical and discovery research programs  including cort  may fail to generate commercially viable product candidates in spite of the resources we may dedicate to the program 
even if product candidates are identified  we may abandon further development efforts before we reach clinical trials or after expending significant expense and time conducting clinical trials due to financial constraints  concerns over safety  efficacy of the product candidates or for other reasons 
moreover  governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts 
if we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations 

table of contents we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects or that our product candidates are not effective  whether by participants in our clinical trials for corlux or other product candidates  or by patients using our future products 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about our product candidates safety or efficacy and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
in some cases  less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the fda approves the product for marketing 
the active ingredient in corlux is used to terminate pregnancy 
therefore  necessary and strict precautions must be taken by clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and  if approved by the fda  physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential  to insure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women 
the failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product claims 
we have only limited product liability insurance coverage  with limits that we believe to be customary for a development stage company 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates 
defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if a third party successfully sues us for any injury caused by our product candidates  our liability could exceed our total assets 
if corlux is approved and we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate coverage and reimbursement for it from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
there is significant uncertainty related to the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medications 
the commercial success of our potential medications in both domestic and international markets is dependent on whether third party coverage and reimbursement is available for them 
government payors  including medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medicines  and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our medications 
the continuing efforts of government and other third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our revenues 
our dependence on the commercial success of corlux alone makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts 
accordingly  even if corlux or future product candidates are approved for commercial sale  unless government and other third party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our future products  physicians may not prescribe them 
we intend to sell corlux directly to hospitals if we receive fda approval 
as a result  we will need to obtain approval from hospital formularies to receive wide spread third party coverage and reimbursement 
if we fail to obtain that approval  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
also  the trends toward managed health care in the united states and proposed legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for our future products or the exclusion of such products from reimbursement programs 

table of contents we may face competition from other companies who attempt to develop mifepristone for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of that disorder and which could have a negative impact on future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for any indication 
as discussed above in the risk related to orphan drug designation  we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has begun a phase ii clinical trial in europe and the united states evaluating the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome 
we are also aware that novartis is developing a somatostatin analogue that is in phase trials for various endocrine disorders  including cushing s disease  which is a subset of the patients with cushing s syndrome 
if a product for treatment of cushing s syndrome is approved for commercialization before corlux  our potential future revenue could be reduced 
we face competition from companies with substantial financial  technical and marketing resources  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression or for other indications 
if approved for commercial use  corlux as a treatment for psychotic depression will compete with established treatments  including ect and combination medicinal therapy 
combination medicinal therapy consists of the use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines  not currently approved for the treatment of psychotic depression 
the antipsychotics are prescribed for off label use by physicians to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression  which is the clinical target of corlux 
antipsychotics include bristol myers squibb s abilify  novartis clozaril  pfizer s geodon and navane  ortho mcneil s haldol  janssen pharmaceutica s risperdal  astrazeneca s seroquel  glaxosmithkline s stelazine and thorazine  mylan s mellaril  schering corporation s trilafon and eli lilly s zyprexa 
corlux may not compete effectively with these established treatments 
we are aware of one clinical trial conducted by organon  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
organon was the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  which was purchased by schering plough 
organon s new chemical entity is a gr ii antagonist  the commercial use of which would be covered by our patent 
as discussed above  in  akzo nobel filed an observation in our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression  in which it challenged the claims of that patent application 
in  we filed a rebuttal to the epo that responded to the points raised by akzo nobel 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
in july  the patent was issued 
as of the time of filing of this report  we are not aware of any other public disclosures by any company  regarding the development of new products to treat psychotic depression 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms  universities and public and private research institutions 
moreover  we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with the development and commercialization of medicinal products that are superior to and more cost effective than corlux 
many of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience  more financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing human medicines  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and commercializing products 
accordingly  corlux may not be an effective competitor against established treatments and our present or potential competitors may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to corlux or render corlux obsolete or non competitive 
if we are unable to establish corlux as a superior and cost effective treatment for psychotic depression  or any future use  we may be unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 

table of contents rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete 
pharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change and we expect that they will continue to do so 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any or all expenses incurred in connection with their development 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have no sales staff and limited marketing activities and will need to develop sales and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize corlux and any future uses of gr ii antagonists 
our employees have limited experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we currently have no sales staff and limited marketing activities 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a sales and marketing force or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our future products 
we currently plan to establish small  specialty sales forces to market and sell corlux in the united states for the treatment of cushing s syndrome and for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  as each indication is approved for marketing by the fda 
however  our sales and marketing efforts may not be successful or cost effective 
in the event that the commercial launch of corlux is delayed due to fda requirements or other reasons  we may establish a sales and marketing force too early relative to the launch of corlux 
this may be expensive  and our investment would be lost if the sales and marketing force could not be retained 
if our efforts to develop a sales and marketing force are not successful  cost effective and timely  we may not achieve profitability 
we may need to increase the size of our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing growth 
as we expand our research and development efforts and develop a sales and marketing organization  we expect to experience growth  which may strain our operations  product development and other managerial and operating resources 
future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain and integrate additional employees 
to date  we have relied on a small management team  including a number of part time contributors 
our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we must be able to manage our research and development efforts effectively  manage our clinical trials effectively  integrate additional management  clinical development  administrative and sales and marketing personnel  expand the size and composition of our management team  develop our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business 

table of contents if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including joseph k 
belanoff  md  our chief executive officer  and robert l 
roe  md  our president 
we do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key research  technical  sales  marketing  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
we face intense competition for such personnel from numerous companies  as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive northern california business area 
although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date  we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain these personnel could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our potential products 
if we acquire other gr ii antagonists or other technologies or potential products  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire other gr ii antagonists  particularly gr ii antagonists that do not terminate pregnancy 
we may also be able to acquire other technologies or potential products that are complementary to our operating plan 
we currently have no commitments  agreements or plans for any acquisitions 
the process of acquiring rights to another gr ii antagonist or any other potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology 
future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our or our manufacturers facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
because our executive offices are located in the san francisco bay area and some of our current manufacturers are located in earthquake prone areas  our business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events  including earthquake  fire  flood  power loss and communications failures 
in addition  political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks  protests or other disruptive events 
if any disaster or other similar event were to occur  we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce our product candidates 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover  and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for  our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 

table of contents risks related to our stock the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non affiliates of the company or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time 
holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active 
during the week period ended march   our average daily trading volume has been approximately  shares and the intra day sales prices per share of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market has ranged from to 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including our cash and short term investment position  actual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials  actual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors products  changes in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors potential development programs  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us  our collaborators or our competitors  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  general market and economic conditions  including those seen as a result of the recent worldwide financial credit crisis  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  developments concerning collaborations  trading volume of our common stock  limited number of shares of our common stock held by our non affiliates  maintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed  announcement of  or expectation of  additional financing efforts  and sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq capital market and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq capital market requirements  our stock could be delisted by the nasdaq capital market 
if delisting occurs  it would adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business 
if we are unable to meet any of the nasdaq listing requirements in the future  including  for example  if the closing bid price for our common stock is below per share for consecutive trading days  the nasdaq capital market staff could determine to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
securities analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports  and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
securities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage 
additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock 
a lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly and significantly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached in between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies such as ours with smaller market capitalizations to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock 
this could have a negative effect on our market price 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock 
as additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market  the supply of our common stock will increase  which could decrease the price 
substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale  subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions 
we may be required to pay significant amounts if we are not able to meet our obligations under our outstanding registration rights agreements 
the registration rights agreement covering the approximately million shares of our common stock issued in a private offering in march and an additional approximately million shares of common stock underlying warrants issued in connection with the offering provided that if we failed to file or cause to be declared effective the registration statement covering the resale of these shares prior to a specified deadlines  or failed to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement subject to limited permissible suspension 
table of contents periods  we would be required to pay the holders of such shares and warrants liquidated damages at the rate of of the purchase price of these shares and warrants per month  up to a total of 
the registration statement covering the resale of the shares and shares underlying the warrants sold in this transaction was declared effective by the sec in november since this registration statement was not declared effective within the time frame specified in the registration rights agreement  we became obligated to pay the investors in this financing liquidated damages of approximately million in as noted above  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement  we may be obligated to pay additional liquidated damage amounts in the future 
see the discussion above under risks related to our business regarding risks associated with the ceff  including the risks regarding registration rights under that agreement 
if we are required to pay significant amounts under these or future registration rights agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to finance our operations 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders acting as a group  will be able to significantly influence corporate actions 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
changes in laws and regulations may result in increased costs to us  which may harm our financial results 
new laws and regulations  as well as changes to existing laws and regulations  affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and by the nasdaq capital market  would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements 
we are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in addition  new rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or our board committees  or as executive officers 
at present  we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs 
compliance with public company obligations  including the securities laws and regulations  is costly and requires significant management resources  and we may fail to comply 
we are a small company with limited resources 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  principal financial officers and directors for 
table of contents securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
in addition  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  this same legislation also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the sec postponed the initial compliance date for this requirement for smaller reporting companies such that the requirement for the auditor s attestation and report will first apply to our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ending december  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to comply with these requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in future years 
if we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in or in future years or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required deadline in and as of future year ends  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our accounting policies or operating practices 
accounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies  including policies regarding are subject to continual review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the sec 
for example  in december  the financial accounting standards board adopted financial accounting standard r  share based payment 
this statement  which we adopted in  requires the recording of expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
as a result  our operating expenses have increased and are likely to continue to increase 
we rely heavily on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
because we are now required to expense stock options on a fair value basis  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements  changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult  even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
some of these provisions divide our board into three classes with only a portion of our directors subject to election at each annual meeting  allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent 
in addition  a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws 
our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our chairman  president or the board of directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
these provisions may prevent or delay a change in our board of directors or our management  which is appointed by our board of directors 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
section may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and 
table of contents under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of severe metabolic and psychiatric disorders 
since our inception in may  we have been developing our lead product  corlux  a potent glucocorticoid receptor ii gr ii antagonist 
we are also developing three series of novel selective gr ii antagonists 
cushing s syndrome cushing s syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
sometimes called hypercortisolism  it is relatively uncommon and most often affects adults aged to an estimated to of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each 
table of contents year  which equates to approximately  new patients in the united states 
this results in an estimated prevalence of  patients with cushing s syndrome in the united states 
the investigational new drug application ind for the evaluation of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome was opened in september the united states food and drug administration fda has indicated that our single patient open label study may provide a reasonable basis for the submission of a new drug application nda for this indication 
we expect to complete enrollment in this phase study in april  as the requisite patients have now been dosed or identified 
we expect to announce results of this study in the fourth quarter of this year and to submit our nda for the use of corlux in cushing s syndrome by year end in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
orphan drug designation is a special status granted by the fda to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
psychotic depression we are also developing corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic major depression under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
psychotic major depression will hereinafter be referred to as psychotic depression 
the fda has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
in march  we commenced enrollment in study  our ongoing phase trial in psychotic depression 
the protocol for this trial incorporates what we have learned from our three previously completed phase trials to address the established relationship between increased drug plasma levels and clinical response and attempts to decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
in one of the previously completed phase trials  study  we prospectively tested and confirmed that patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo  this threshold was established from data produced in earlier studies 
as expected  patients who took mg of corlux in study developed higher drug plasma levels than patients who received lower doses 
further  there was no discernable difference in the incidence of adverse events between placebo and any of the three corlux dose groups in study based on this information  we are using a corlux dose of mg once per day for seven days in study in addition  we also are utilizing a third party centralized rating service to independently evaluate the patients for entry into the study as well as for their level of response 
we believe the centralization of this process will improve the consistency of rating across clinical trial sites and reduce the background noise that was illustrated in earlier studies and is endemic to many psychopharmacologic studies 
we believe that this change in dose  as well as the other modifications to the protocol  should allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of corlux in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression 
in march  we announced that  in order to lower variable and fixed expenses and to conserve financial resources  we were scaling back our planned rate of spending on this trial and extended the timeline for its completion 
as of early july  we completed the implementation of this strategy  which included reducing the number of clinical sites to eight 
management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics in  we published the results of studies in rats that demonstrated that corlux both reduced the weight gain associated with the ongoing use of olanzapine and mitigated the weight gain associated with the initiation of treatment with olanzapine the active ingredient in zyprexa 
this study was paid for by eli lilly and company eli lilly 

table of contents during we announced positive results from our clinical proof of concept study in lean healthy male volunteers evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa 
the results show a statistically significant reduction in weight gain in those subjects who took zyprexa plus corlux compared to those who took zyprexa plus placebo 
also  the addition of corlux to treatment with zyprexa had a beneficial impact on secondary metabolic measures such as fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
eli lilly provided zyprexa and financial support for this study 
in january we announced positive results from a similar proof of concept study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of johnson johnson s risperdal 
this study  which began in  confirmed the earlier results seen with corlux and zyprexa  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in weight and secondary metabolic endpoints of fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
the results from the study of corlux and risperdal were presented at several scientific conferences  including the american diabetes association meeting in june the combination of zyprexa or risperdal and corlux is not approved for any indication 
the purpose of these studies was to explore the hypothesis that gr ii antagonists would mitigate weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications 
the group of medications known as atypical antipsychotics  including zyprexa  risperdal  clozaril and seroquel  are widely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
all medications in this group are associated with treatment emergent weight gain of varying degrees and carry a warning in the label relating to treatment emergent hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
research in  we initiated a discovery research program to identify and patent selective gr ii antagonists to develop a pipeline of products for proprietary use 
three distinct series of gr ii antagonists were identified 
these compounds appear to be as potent as our lead product corlux in blocking cortisol but  unlike corlux  they do not appear to block the pr progesterone  er estrogen  ar androgen or gr i mineralocorticoid receptors 
composition of matter patents on all of the three series have been granted in europe 
the patent on two series have issued in the united states 
examination has not yet begun in the united states on the third 
new chemical entity cort in  we commenced a human microdosing study of one of our newly identified selective gr ii antagonists  cort  with xceleron limited utilizing their accelerator mass spectrometry technology 
in this microdosing study  we evaluated cort  a compound which develops particularly high plasma and brain concentrations in an animal model 
on may   we announced the results from this study  which demonstrated that cort was extremely well absorbed  demonstrated good bioavailability and had a half life that appears compatible with once a day oral dosing 
in addition  further pharmacokinetic testing of cort in a rat model indicated that a ten fold increase in oral dose milligrams per kilograms to milligrams per kilograms led to a proportional increase in the amount of compound detected in plasma 
in september  we signed a second agreement with eli lilly  under which eli lilly agreed to provide funding and provide olanzapine for two studies to test the effectiveness of cort in rat models of olanzapine induced weight gain 
in january we announced top line results from these studies of cort and olanzapine 
the results from the studies of both the prevention and reversal of antipsychotic induced weight gain were positive and statistically significant 
the results of these studies were presented at the international society of psychoneuroendocrinology and the world congress of biological psychiatry conferences in july at the american diabetes association conference in june there was also a presentation of preclinical data from another study of cort conducted at stanford university 
this study demonstrated that cort 
table of contents suppresses body weight gain and improves insulin sensitivity in healthy mice fed a fat diet and high sucrose liquid 
the manufacturing and pre clinical development of cort began late in and continued through as preparatory steps to the submission of an ind with the fda  which we submitted in december on february   we began dosing patients in the phase study with this compound 
general our activities to date have included product development  designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and intellectual property prosecution and expansion 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred and common stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us  except for the limited revenue that has been collected under the agreements with eli lilly discussed above 
we are in the development stage and have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we have not generated any revenue other than the revenue under the agreements with eli lilly  and do not expect to generate significant revenue until corlux has been approved by the fda for marketing in the united states  if at all 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for corlux  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our corlux clinical development program  apply for regulatory approvals  initiate development of newly identified gr ii antagonists for various indications  continue our discovery research program  acquire and develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our corlux clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 
results of operations collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreements with eli lilly discussed above under the caption overview management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics 
under these agreements  eli lilly agreed to supply the zyprexa and olanzapine and pay for the costs of the studies 
we were required to perform development activities as specified in the agreements and we were reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue was recognized as the services are rendered in accordance with the agreements 

table of contents during the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately   and  respectively  under these agreements 
there will be no revenue under the agreements in the future as all of the activities were completed by mid research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including facilities costs and non cash stock based compensation  as well as the costs of discovery research  pre clinical studies  clinical trial preparations  enrollment and monitoring expenses  regulatory costs  the costs of manufacturing development and the costs of manufacture and or acquisition of clinical trial materials 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during  as compared to  there were increases of approximately million in costs related to research  manufacturing and ind enabling work with our selective gr ii antagonist  cort   related to the phase trial and the long term extension study in cushing s syndrome   related to the conduct of other nda supportive studies   in staffing costs   of consulting expenses and  related to the cost of a carcogenicity study 
offsetting these increases were decreases of approximately million in manufacturing expenses related to corlux due to the acquisition and manufacture during of the initial supply of materials for the corlux clinical trials and completion of certain manufacturing process development activities related to corlux   related to the scaling back of our phase trial of corlux in psychotic depression that was announced in march   in basic research on our selective gr ii antagonists as cort moved into the ind enabling phase and  related to our clinical trial of corlux for the mitigation of weight gain caused by risperdal that was completed early in research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses reflects clinical trial cost increases of approximately million related to trials in psychotic depression  cushing s syndrome and the mitigation of weight gain caused by risperdal that commenced in  which were partially offset by decreases of approximately million due to the completion of our earlier phase clinical trials for psychotic depression  our cardiac study and our earlier human proof of concept study in the mitigation of zyprexa induced weight gain in during  we also performed two smaller clinical studies to test formulation development and drug drug interaction at a cost of approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were also increases in contract research expenses of approximately  due to basic research work on new chemical compounds  approximately  related to other research and preclinical work with our selective new gr ii antagonist  cort  and approximately  of costs associated with the rat studies using this compound in combination with olanzapine  which was conducted in connection with the agreement with eli lilly discussed above 
in addition  during the year ended december   there was an increase in manufacturing expenses of approximately  due to the acquisition and manufacture of materials for the clinical trials and manufacturing process development 
there were also increases of approximately  in staffing costs   in consulting expenses   in travel costs and  in the allocation of facilities costs during as compared to research and development expenses discussed above included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and the increase in expense between years was primarily the result of expense related to new option grants calculated on a straight line basis  which was partially offset by the decrease of expense due to the declining scale of expense related to earlier option grants that were being expensed using the graded vesting method 
in addition  during  upon the termination of an employee who worked in a development function  we recorded a reversal of approximately  of previously reported stock based compensation expense  which represents the difference between the expense recorded and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the service of these individuals as employees 
there were no terminations or conversions to consultant during or 
table of contents below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands corlux psychotic depression cushing s syndrome weight gain mitigation selective gr ii antagonists unallocated activities  including nda supportive studies and manufacturing  regulatory  pre clinical activities stock based compensation total research and development expense the data in the table above for the years ended december  and has been reorganized to be consistent with the presentation for to recognize that certain costs such as nda supportive studies  some manufacturing activities  regulatory and pre clinical activities are not readily allocable to any one product or indication as these activities benefit multiple products and or indications 
we expect that research and development expenditures will increase during as compared to due to the continuation of our phase studies in cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression  and the continued development of cort and our other proprietary selective gr ii antagonists 
research and development expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on the availability of additional funds to finance clinical development plans 
see also  liquidity and capital resources 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
the cost and timing of development of our selective gr ii antagonists will be dependent on our success in the effort and any difficulties that may be encountered 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase reflects higher staffing costs of approximately  due primarily to the recruitment of our new chief financial officer during the fourth quarter of  which includes a net increase in stock based compensation of  that reflects the expense related to stock options granted to our new chief financial officer  other employees and directors late in and during during this period  there were also increases in professional fees and consultancy costs of approximately  primarily related to the costs associated with periodic filings with the sec and the preparations for the initial year of auditor attestation under sox section  which requirement was deferred until by the sec in a ruling announced in october these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in legal expenses due primarily to the reduction in patent related legal costs in as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in costs between years was primarily an 
table of contents increase of approximately  of legal costs related to patent activities and combined increases in staffing and consultancy costs of approximately  the changes in staffing costs include increases in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  and in recruiting costs of approximately  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  related to bonus compensation 
the increase in stock based compensation was the net result of approximately  of costs associated with additional stock options being expensed under the straight line method  decreases of approximately  associated with the declining scale of expense of options accounted for under the graded vesting method and the inclusion in of a reversal of approximately  of stock compensation expense in connection with the resignation of an officer  which represented the excess of expense under the graded vesting method as compared with the expense associated with stock options that actually vested prior to this termination 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the amount of general and administrative expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff necessary to support our continued clinical development activities  potential product commercialization support and the availability of additional funds

interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of investment management fees  was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in and  in interest income in and included approximately  and  respectively  related to the note receivable in connection with the march financing  which was collected in february in addition  there were also decreases in yields and balances of invested funds as compared to the increase in net interest income in as compared to is the net result of the interest on this note being partially offset by decreased yields and balances of invested funds as compared to other expense 
other expense for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to million in and  in the other expense for was primarily related to the cost of liquidated damages due to the delay in the effectiveness of the registration statement of the securities sold in the march financing 
other expense includes interest expense on capitalized leases and state tax on capital  which is based on our capital and asset positions as of each year end 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments balances of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure 
during we sold common stock and warrants in a private placement generating gross proceeds of approximately million and we sold common stock to kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  under a committed equity financing facility ceff generating an additional  issuance costs for these transactions totaled approximately  in february  we collected a note receivable of million that had been issued in march in connection with the march financing 
in january  we sold additional stock to kingsbridge under the ceff for proceeds of  the net proceeds of all these transactions have been  or will be  used for general corporate purposes 

table of contents we expect cash used in operating activities to increase during as the increased spending on the continuation of our cushing s syndrome study and the development of our selective gr ii antagonists  including cort  is expected to be only partially offset by the decreased spending on psychotic depression  as compared to spending levels during we expect our funding requirements for operating activities will increase during later years due to the continuation and expansion of our development programs for cushing s syndrome  psychotic depression and our selective gr ii antagonists  research activities  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to maintain our operations into early  including the planned completion of enrollment of our phase cushing s syndrome trial  continuation of our long term extension study in this indication  and other activities in preparation of the submission of an nda for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  the continuation of enrollment in our phase psychotic depression trial  the early clinical development of cort  one of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  and research activities aimed at the selection of additional compounds for further study 
we will need to raise additional funds to continue the development of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or the psychotic features of psychotic depression beyond early  to prepare for the commercialization of corlux for either of these indications and to continue and expand the development of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 
in march  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge 
under the terms of the agreement  kingsbridge committed to provide up to million of capital in exchange for newly issued shares of our common stock for a period of up to three years after the sec declares effective the registration statements filed by us covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
in june  the sec declared effective our registration statement with the sec covering the resale of approximately million of the shares issuable under the ceff and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
this registration statement covers approximately of the million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff and all of the  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
as of the filing of this report  approximately million shares remain available for sale under the initial registration statement 
we intend to file an additional registration statement covering the resale of the remaining million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff approximately days after kingsbridge and its affiliates have resold substantially all of the securities registered for sale under this initial registration statement 
under the terms of the agreement  the determination of the exact timing and amount of any ceff financings will be made solely by us  subject to certain conditions 
the agreement currently requires a minimum stock price of per share to allow us to issue shares to kingsbridge under the ceff 
through january  we have raised a total of approximately million from the sales of stock under the ceff 
based on the volume weighted average price on the nasdaq capital market for our common stock for the period from march   the date of the signing of the kingsbridge ceff  through march   the maximum amount of additional funds that could be raised under the ceff is approximately million 
the actual amount of funds that can be raised under this agreement will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of our stock during the pricing periods of each sale 

table of contents while we monitor the cash balance in our checking account and transfer the funds in only as needed  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institution were to fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
on october   the federal deposit insurance corporation implemented its temporary liquidity guarantee program 
under this program  non interest bearing commercial accounts are insured to an unlimited amount through june   thus mitigating our exposure to any possible bank failure 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our checking accounts 
as a result of volatile market conditions  the cost and availability of capital has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid capital markets 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  including our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our estimates of obligations under contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands research and development studies through operating lease capital leases minimum royalty payments per year total   per year amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  during and  we signed agreements for services in connection with our trials for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
the total commitment under these agreements is approximately million 
approximately  of costs under these agreements have been expensed as of december   with the remainder to be expensed over the remainder of the trials 
under the master agreement with these vendors  the agreements may be terminated upon sixty days notice to the vendors 
if terminated early  we would be responsible for the costs incurred by the vendor through the effective date of the termination plus cancellation charges as stipulated in the various agreements 
during  we signed agreements for services in connection with our ongoing phase trial to confirm the utility of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the total commitment under these original agreements was approximately million 
in june  we amended these agreements to reduce the amounts of commitments with these organizations by approximately million in accordance with the reduction in the near term scope of activities under this trial 
however  we view the reduction in these commitments as a temporary measure as it is our intent to continue the conduct of this trial to its conclusion  when sufficient capital is available for this purpose 
approximately million of these costs was expensed through december   with the remainder to be incurred over the course of the trial 
under the master services agreements with these vendors  the project contracts may be terminated upon thirty to sixty day s notice 
if terminated early  we would be responsible for the costs incurred by the vendors through the effective date of termination plus cancellation charges as stipulated in the agreements 
during the period from october to december  we signed agreements with contract research organizations and other vendors for the conduct of four of the nda supportive studies for aggregate commitments of approximately million 
approximately  of costs under these agreements has been expensed as of december   with the remainder to be incurred during in october  we renewed the operating lease agreement for our office facility for a two year term commencing on january  the new lease provides us an option to extend the lease for an additional year upon days notice 
during  we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of certain pieces of office furniture 
the obligations under these leases will be fully satisfied during under our cancellable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses with stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 

table of contents under the agreement with our contract research company  we are obligated to make a payment of  related to the commencement in february of the phase clinical trial evaluating cort we also have other contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
a under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with psychotic depression and early dementia  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering the licensed product and  upon fda approval of the licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
b under the agreement with our contract research company we may be obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events  including i patent filings in connection with the project  ii entries into phase clinical trials  and iii national regulatory approval of each product arising from work performed under the agreement  provided that sales of the product by the company or any future licensees reach  these obligations remain in force after the conclusion of work under the agreement 
there are no royalty obligations associated with this contract 
c our agreement with scinopharm taiwan that provides for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for corlux includes a minimum purchase commitment of  per year following the commercial launch of corlux 
this agreement may be terminated by us at any time without penalty 
d on november   we signed an agreement with produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas  for the manufacture of mifepristone  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in corlux  for our development and commercial needs for an initial period of five years 
the agreement provides for an automatic extension for one additional year unless either party gives twelve month s prior notice that it does not want the extension 
there is no guaranteed minimum purchase commitment under this agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty 
in february  we signed an agreement with a clinical research organization for the conduct of a phase clinical study to evaluate cort for a commitment of approximately  and  in march  we signed agreements with two contract research organizations and a clinical research site for the conduct of two nda supportive studies for corlux for aggregate commitments of approximately million 
all of these amounts are expected to be expended in net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million in federal research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as approximately million of california net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million in california research and development tax credit carryforwards  available to offset any future taxable income we may generate 
the federal and california net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized in any particular year if certain changes in our ownership occur

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accruals of research and development costs 
we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed  and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors are as follows options granted subsequent to january  the grant date fair value for all new grants issued after january  is being amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
the expected term used in determining the fair value for options is based on the simplified method prescribed by the sec that considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
there has been no adjustment made to the expected term to adjust for employees expected exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior because we have a limited employee base and do not have sufficient historical information to determine such an adjustment 
the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value of option grants is based on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies since we do not have sufficient historical data from which to base an appropriate volatility assumption 
options granted prior to january  for options granted prior to our initial public offering ipo in  we have continued to account for the portion of these grants that were non vested as of january  based on the intrinsic value of these grants 
for the options granted after the ipo  we began  as of january   to record non cash stock based compensation expense in the financial statements in amounts that represent the remaining fair value of the non vested portion of these grants 

table of contents for all options granted prior to january   we are continuing to utilize the graded vesting attribution method for amortization of the relevant compensation amounts 
since we have a limited employee base  we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations and  therefore  do not apply a forfeiture rate 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded in the financial statements and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
as of december   the company had approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense for employee options outstanding as of that date  which had a remaining weighted average vesting period of years 
non employees stock based compensation related to option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  based on the fair value of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the determination of fair value for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is re measured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq capital market 
recently adopted accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted a change in the accounting standards applicable to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this change eliminates the residual method of allocation and the requirement to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable needs to be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  it is permissible to use the best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
this change is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
as the company does not have any such agreements at this time  this change is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf discussed possible changes to the standard regarding the milestone method of revenue recognition 
under the milestone method  the additional consideration earned from achievement of the milestone is viewed as being indicative of the value provided to the customer through either a the efforts performed by the vendor or b a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance to achieve that specific milestone 
under the milestone method an entity recognizes contingent arrangement consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the proposed model requires that a milestone be substantive before this method can be applied  that is  there is a substantial uncertainty about the achievement of the milestone  substantive effort is required to achieve the milestone  and none of the payment for the milestone is refundable 
the eitf did not reach a consensus on this issue 
the task force will continue deliberations on this issue at future meetings 
the adoption of such a standard is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements as we currently have no such arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
