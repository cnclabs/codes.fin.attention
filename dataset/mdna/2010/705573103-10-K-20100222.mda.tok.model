item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our products and services we develop and license rules based bpm software and provide professional services  maintenance  and training related to our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are companies or divisions within companies  and are typically large organizations that are among the leaders in their industry 
our strategy is to sell initial licenses to these target accounts that are focused on a specific purpose or area of operations  rather than selling large enterprise licenses 
this strategy allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and limits their initial investment 
once a customer has realized this initial value  we work with the customer to identify opportunities for follow on sales 
our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our prpc software and related solution frameworks 
prpc is a comprehensive platform for building and managing bpm applications that unifies business rules and business processes

these products often require less implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products 
in many cases this has resulted in a shorter sales process and implementation period 
prpc and related solution frameworks can be used by a broad range of customers within financial services  insurance and healthcare markets  as well as other markets  such as life sciences  communications  travel and entertainment  and government 
we also offer smartpaas  which is our platform as a service offering that allows customers to create prpc applications using an internet based infrastructure 
this offering enables pegasystems customers to immediately build their applications in a secure environment while minimizing their infrastructure and hardware costs 
our customers typically request professional services and training to assist them in implementing our products 
almost all of our customers also purchase maintenance on our products  which includes rights to upgrades and new releases  incident resolution and technical assistance

the use of fair value to measure investments  with related unrealized gains or losses on investments  is a significant component to our consolidated results of operations 
we value our investments by using quoted market prices and broker or dealer quotations which are based on third party pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include some of the government debt securities  some of the municipal debt securities  money market securities and most of the corporate debt securities 
we do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include most of the municipal debt securities and some of the corporate debt securities 
the price for each security at the measurement date is sourced from an independent pricing vendor 
periodically  management may assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers to derive the fair value of these financial instruments 
management assesses the inputs of the pricing in order to categorize the financial instruments into the appropriate hierarchy levels 
see note fair value measurements in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from software licenses  maintenance fees related to our software licenses  and professional services 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements

software license revenues perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract that is not perfunctory is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software other than maintenance support  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
as a result of our focus on frequent sales to our targeted customers  our strategy to sell initial term licensing agreements to those customers with the goal to generate follow on sales  and as a result of extended payment terms  we recognize term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

table of contents historically  the majority of our term license arrangements were larger agreements with extended payment terms that did not typically result in follow on license agreements 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under the original payment terms  therefore for these arrangements  we have recognized the present value of the future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
a portion of the license fees payable under these agreements equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments was initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used were estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate 
as of december   the discount rates associated with the remaining installment receivables ranged from to 
as of december   the remaining balance of these installment receivables totaled approximately million as summarized in the table on page for licensing arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products  fees are accounted for as subscriptions and the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
maintenance revenues maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
perpetual software maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the related maintenance agreement  which is generally one year and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for term licenses  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the license term when the renewal rate or period is not substantive compared to the term license 
in general  maintenance and support obligations are based on separately stated renewal rates in the arrangement that are deemed substantive and therefore represent vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
professional services revenues our services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services  including software implementation  training  and reimbursable expenses 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
revenue from stand alone training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vsoe of fair value for our training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts in all geographic areas  except in australia and a european country 
services may be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for fixed price services 
when fixed price services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  and when services  including maintenance  are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
in the past  in a limited number of our arrangements  the fixed price services were essential to the arrangement because we made significant alterations to the functionality of the software or built complex interfaces necessary for the software to be functional in the customer s environment 
we have not been able to make reasonably dependable estimates for the purpose of determining our progress to completion  as we have limited experience with these types of unique and complex arrangements 
accordingly  when the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement  all revenue and costs are deferred until the completion of the fixed price services under the completed contract method 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized ratably during the service period  which is typically less than four months 
we warrant to our customers that our software products will conform to documented specifications 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 

table of contents our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have not established any related reserves 
deferred revenue deferred software license revenue typically results from customer specific acceptance provisions and other arrangements for which all of the criteria to recognize revenue have not been met 
deferred maintenance revenue represents software license updates and product support contracts that are typically billed on an annual basis in advance and are recognized ratably over the support periods 
deferred professional services revenue represents advanced billings for consulting and training services that are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for sales credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimates are based on the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate that resulted in their inability to make required payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of potential sales credit memos 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of sales credit memos and assumptions about future events and experience with customer disputes 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with equity awards in our consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
stock based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity award  and adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we recognize stock based compensation using the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved changes to our equity compensation program  including the granting of rsus in addition to stock options  for periodic equity compensation grants 
rsus deliver to the recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of our common stock upon vesting  net of tax withholding 
unlike stock options  there is no cost to the employee at share issuance 
we value our rsus at the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date  less the present value of expected dividends as the employee is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period 
we periodically grant stock options and rsus for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors 
the exercise price for stock options is greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of key assumptions including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of our stock price over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the 
table of contents historical volatility of our stock price 
the expected annual dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend of per share divided by the average stock price 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected option term at the time of grant 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the choice of a valuation model  and the underlying assumptions used in applying that model  involves significant judgment 
our judgment reflects our assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgment could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
accounting for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
see note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s liability for uncertain tax positions 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
to date we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately   and of our total revenue from sales to customers based outside of the us in   and  respectively 
our international license and professional services sales have increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the operating expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset our foreign currency exposure from sales 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro relative to the us dollar  could adversely impact our revenues and operating results 
most of our transactions with customers are invoiced from our offices in the us for those transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have receivables and license installments that are valued in foreign currencies 
our us operating company holds cash in foreign currencies in order to support our foreign operations 
our functional currency is primarily the us dollar  therefore  when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  we recognize a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries have intercompany accounts that are eliminated in consolidation  but that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our short term intercompany accounts are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had net monetary assets valued in foreign currencies subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses  consisting primarily of cash  receivables  and license installments  partially offset by accounts payable and intercompany payables  with a carrying value of approximately million 
a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would have changed the carrying value of these net assets by approximately million as of that date with a corresponding foreign currency gain loss recognized in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we recorded a million foreign currency transaction gain due to the increase in the value of foreign currencies  primarily the euro and british pound sterling  relative to the us dollar 
interest rate exposure we invest primarily in tax exempt municipal bonds  government sponsored enterprise bonds and corporate bonds that are fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale and as such  unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effect  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  when the investments are sold  the unrealized gains and losses are recorded as realized gains and losses and included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we analyze our investments for impairments on an ongoing basis 
as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our marketable securities
