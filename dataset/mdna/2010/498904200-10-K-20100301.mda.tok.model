overview we are a designer and manufacturer of furnishings and accessories  textiles and fine leathers for the workplace and home 
our commitment to innovation and modern design has yielded a comprehensive portfolio of products and a brand recognized for high quality and a sophisticated image 
our products are targeted at the middle to upper end of the market and are sold primarily in north america through a direct sales force and a broad network of independent dealers 
our business structure and operating approach continue to deliver industry leading operating income margins among our primary publicly held competitors 
we operate under a management 
table of contents philosophy that incorporates a collaborative culture  client driven processes and a lean  agile operating structure 
our employees are performance driven and motivated by a variable incentive compensation system and broad based equity ownership in the company 
fiscal year proved to be a very difficult year for us and our industry as a whole 
we experienced unprecedented declines in sales across the industry as the global economy continued to deteriorate 
as an industry  we saw the declines begin in the fourth quarter of and continue through in  our industry trade organization  the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association  or bifma  reported sales declined when compared to we were not immune to this decline as our sales declined when compared to the prior year 
our sales decreased across all product categories and geographies with the largest declines occurring in offices systems and in europe 
our specialty and complimentary products fared better than office systems but both experienced double digit declines 
in  operating income decreased and earnings per share fell when compared with during  as the industry continued to deteriorate we took actions to protect our industry leading profit margins 
we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges in which included job eliminations  showroom closings  and the discontinuation of certain product lines 
these actions along with previously implemented restructuring plans have allowed us to remain profitable through these extraordinary times 
in response to the difficult economic environment we continued to aggressively manage our balance sheet 
we tightened our accounts receivable collection policies and reduced our inventory to bring it more in line with the lower demand levels 
we used free cash in to pay down million of debt bringing our total debt outstanding to below million for the first time this decade 
we remain in compliance with all bank covenants and our revolving credit facility extends until june in addition  during the year ended december  we used free cash to pay dividends to our shareholders totaling million and invested million in capital expenditures 
despite the difficult economic environment  in we had one of the most successful product launches in our company s history as we introduced the generation by knoll chair 
this chair has received many accolades including winning the best of neocon gold award for office seating 
it has had one of the fastest ramp ups in terms of market acceptance and demand of any chair in our history and helped during the fourth quarter of to contribute to our first sequential increase in backlog in six quarters 
backlog of unfilled orders at december  increased million  or  when compared to september  backlog of unfilled orders of million 
we believe this chair will have a major impact on our seating revenue in the future and ultimately help us gain the market share we desire in that category 
our strategy continues to be diversifying our sales away from a primary dependence on north american office systems to higher margin products such as seating and our specialty businesses 
in  we will continue to push our growth internationally and our focus on our high design  high margin specialty businesses 
we will continue to aggressively monitor our spending and invest in new products 
all these things will better position us to succeed when the recovery in our industry occurs

at december   sales backlog was million  a decrease of million  or  from sales backlog of million as of december  in  the global recession greatly impacted the office furniture industry 
a widespread lack of business confidence and growing unemployment levels increased office vacancy rates and lowered the demand for our products  especially office systems 
office systems as a product category were impacted the most by the decline in demand with sales declining when compared to although we have diversified our sales over recent years by growing our seating and specialty businesses to make us less dependent on the office systems category  office systems still represent a significant portion of our sales 
sales to the us government remained strong in and became a larger portion of our overall revenue in approximately of our sales were to the us government and related agencies 
although the recent recession has been worldwide  geographically our european sales declined at a greater pace than north america 
the substantial reduction in industry demand has resulted in a very competitive pricing environment as our industry competes for a smaller pool of business 
this pricing pressure had a significant impact on sales  but we believe we managed to stay competitive and offset some of this pricing pressure through our cost reduction activities 
gross profit and operating income gross profit for was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit of million for operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or 
table of contents  from operating income of million for we are relatively pleased with the profit levels we reported in given the significant deterioration in industry demand and a reduction of million in our sales from as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased from for to for the decrease in gross margin during was primarily due to price deterioration and lower absorption of our fixed costs as a result of our lower sales volumes 
operating income as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in operating profit for includes restructuring charges of million compared to million in operating expenses for  excluding restructuring charges  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the decrease in operating expenses during was in large part due to decreased spending in conjunction with our lower sales volumes 
decreased sales and incentive compensation accounted for million of the reduction 
in addition  decreased bad debt expense and previously implemented cost reduction measures added to the decrease 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a decrease of million from interest expense of million for the decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower borrowing rates

the effective tax rate was for compared to for years ended december  and sales sales for were billion  an increase of million  or  from sales of billion for the increase was mainly attributable to increased sales in our specialty and complimentary businesses 
incremental sales from our edelman leather business  acquired during the fourth quarter of  also added to the increase 
in addition  net sales benefited from previously implemented price increases 
approximately million of the increase for total net sales  or approximately  was attributable to additional revenues realized from price increases

operating income for includes restructuring charges of million 
operating expenses for  excluding restructuring charges  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the increase in operating expenses during was in large part due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with our edelman leather business  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of  and increased bad debt expense

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock net repayment of proceeds from debt payment of dividends net proceeds from issuance of stock net cash used for financing activities historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares and scheduled payments of principal and interest under our debt 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus non cash amortizations  offset by million of unfavorable changes in working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus non cash amortizations  plus million of favorable changes in working capital 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
in  we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  repurchase million of common stock for treasury  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
on october   we completed the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited 
cash expenditures for the transaction totaled million  net of cash acquired 
cash from financing activities in also included the payment of fees on the refinanced credit facility 
we use our existing secured million revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs  and at times make significant borrowings and repayments under the facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
this facility matures in june and provides us with the option to increase the size of the facility by up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under the facility  compared to million outstanding under the facility as of december  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time  but no later than june 
table of contents our revolving credit facility requires that we comply with two financial covenants i our consolidated leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters  cannot exceed to  and ii our consolidated interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of our consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense  must be a minimum of to we are also required to comply with various other affirmative and negative covenants  including without limitation  covenants that prevent or restrict our ability to pay dividends  engage in certain mergers or acquisitions  make certain investments or loans  incur future indebtedness  make significant capital expenditures  engage in sale leaseback transactions  alter our capital structure or line of business  prepay subordinated indebtedness  engage in certain transactions with affiliates and sell stock or assets 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
however  because of the financial covenants mentioned above  our capacity under our revolving credit facility could be reduced if our trailing consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement continues to decline due to deteriorating market conditions 
future principal debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our fixed long term contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term debt operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions postretirement benefit plan obligations total contractual obligations for long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest has been included at either the fixed rate or the variable rate in effect as of december   as applicable 
environmental matters our past and present business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be 
table of contents enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademarks and deferred financing fees 
goodwill is recorded at the amount by which cost exceeds the net assets of acquired businesses  and all other intangible assets are recorded at cost 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of impairment exist earlier 

table of contents financing costs that are incurred by us in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
the period of these costs may be shortened if the underlying indebtedness is modified or retired 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of our us employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan s asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gain and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under the appropriate accounting guidance  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate we use to determine the obligation for these benefits matches the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and 
table of contents advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was in determining the benefit obligation for and in determining the net periodic benefit cost for the rate was then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of for and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december   by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance  we recognize in our statement of financial position the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the appropriate accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the above valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax 
table of contents losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance the applicable accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
interest rate swap agreements on may   we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing our risk in interest rate fluctuations 
these agreements each hedge a notional amount of million of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
two of the agreements were effective june  and expire on june  on these two agreements  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate of interest equal to three month london interbank offered rate libor  as determined on the last day of each quarterly settlement period 
the other two agreements are effective on june  and expire on june  we pay a fixed rate of on these two agreements and receive a variable rate of interest equal to three month libor 
the company has elected to apply hedge accounting to these swap agreements 
changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the net amount paid or received upon quarterly settlements is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense  with a corresponding reduction in other comprehensive income loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance entitled  the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap in the united states 
this new guidance establishes the fasb accounting standards codification tm as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
this new guidance is effective for most financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted this guidance as of september  this adoption did not have a material impact our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it does not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable gaap that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions 
this new guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
we adopted this new guidance as of june   as required 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis 
these changes define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance applies to other gaap that require or permit fair value measurements and is to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of these changes  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  had no impact on our financial statements 
these provisions will be applied at such time a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial liability is required  which may result in a fair value that is materially different than would have been calculated prior to the adoption of these changes 
in november  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on accounting for defensive intangible assets 
this guidance clarifies how to account for acquired defensive intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement that the company does not intend to actively use but does intend to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset 
this new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of this new guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the assets 
this new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the new guidance as of january   as required 
our adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
specifically  entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
the new guidance encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we adopted the new guidance as of january   as required 
our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which is intended to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
the new guidance requires that the acquiring entity in a business combination recognize all and only the assets and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information that they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
in addition  the new guidance modifies the accounting for transaction and restructuring costs 
it is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted the new guidance as of january   as required 
the application of the new guidance could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements if we consummate business combinations in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations and related interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non us operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers 
we have risk in our exposure to certain material and transportation costs 
steel  leather  wood products and plastics are all used in the manufacture of our products 
for the year ended december   material deflation was approximately thousand and transportation deflation was approximately million 
during  material inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was approximately million 
we continue to work to offset price increases in raw materials and transportation through our global sourcing initiatives  cost improvements and price increases to our products 
interest rate risk we have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates impacts the interest incurred and cash paid on the variable rate debt 
we use interest rate swap agreements for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in may of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate risk 
each agreement hedges a notional amount of million 
two of the agreements are effective from june  through june  and the other two are effective from june  through june  fluctuations in libor affect both our net financial instrument position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by us  if any  under these agreements

table of contents the ineffective portion of the above noted swap agreements was deemed immaterial as of december  an increase in our effective interest rate of would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
we will continue to review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and evaluate whether we should manage such exposures through derivative transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we manufacture our products in the united states  canada and italy  and sell our products primarily in those markets as well as in other european countries
