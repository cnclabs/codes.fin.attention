item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors beginning on page of this report 
overview we operate distinctive and large  multi use sports and athletic  professional fitness  family recreation and spa centers in a resort like environment 
as of february   we operated centers primarily in residential locations across states under the life time fitness and life time athletic brands 
we compare the results of our centers based on how long the centers have been open at the most recent measurement period 
we include a center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month of the center s operation  prior to which time we refer to the center as a new center 
we include an acquired center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after we assumed the center s operations 
as we grow our presence in existing markets by opening new centers  we expect to attract some memberships away from our other existing centers already in those markets  reducing revenue and initially lowering the memberships of those existing centers 
in addition  as a result of new center openings in existing markets  and because older centers will represent an increasing proportion of our center base over time  our comparable center revenue may be lower in future periods than in the past 
of the three new large format centers we have opened or plan to open in  two will be in existing markets 
of the two boutique centers we have opened or plan to open in  both will be in existing markets 
we do not expect that operating costs of our planned new centers will be significantly higher than centers opened in the past  and we also do not expect that the planned increase in the number of centers will have a material adverse effect on the overall financial condition or results of operations of existing centers 
as a result of opening new centers  assuming the operations of seven leased facilities in  assuming the operations of one leased facility in and entering into sale leaseback transactions for six facilities in  our center operating margins are lower than they have been historically 
we expect that the addition of pre opening expenses and the lower revenue volumes characteristic of newly opened centers  as well as the occupancy costs for the eight leased centers and the lease costs for facilities which we financed through sale leaseback transactions  will affect our center operating margins at these centers and on a consolidated basis 
in and  we experienced increased member attrition and lower revenue per membership as well as higher membership acquisition costs due to the challenging economic environment 
if the challenging economic conditions continue  we may face continued lower total revenue and operating profit in affected centers and on a consolidated basis 
certain of our markets may be impacted more severely than others as a result of regional economic factors such as housing  competition or unemployment rates 
our categories of new centers and existing centers do not include the center owned by bloomingdale  llc because it is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as member satisfaction ratings  return on investment  average revenue per membership  including membership dues and enrollment fees  average in center revenue per membership and center operating expenses  with an emphasis on payroll and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales and comparable center revenue growth 
we use center revenue and ebitda margins to evaluate overall performance and profitability on an individual center basis 
in addition  we focus on several membership statistics on a center level and system wide basis 
these metrics include change in center membership levels and growth of system wide memberships  percentage center membership to target capacity  center membership usage  center membership mix among individual  couple and family memberships  flex subscription memberships and center attrition rates 
during  our annual attrition rate increased from to driven primarily by the 
table of contents slowing economy and inactive members leaving earlier than in the past 
during  our annual attrition rate has decreased from to we have three primary sources of revenue first  our largest source of revenue is membership dues of total revenue for the year ended december  and enrollment fees of total revenue for the year ended december  paid by our members 
we recognize revenue from monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we recognize revenue from enrollment fees over the estimated average membership life  which we estimate to be months for and the fourth quarter of  months for the second and third quarters of and months for the first quarter of and prior periods 
second  we generate revenue within a center  which we refer to as in center revenue  or in center businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   including fees for personal training  registered dieticians  group fitness training and other member activities  sales of products at our lifecafe  sales of products and services offered at our lifespa  tennis programs and renting space in certain of our centers 
third  we have expanded the life time fitness brand into other wellness related offerings that generate revenue  which we refer to as other revenue  or corporate businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   including our media  wellness and athletic events businesses 
our primary media offering is our magazine  experience life 
other revenue also includes two restaurants in the minneapolis market and rental income from our highland park  minnesota office building 
center operations expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs  utilities  repairs and maintenance  supplies  administrative support and communications to operate our centers 
advertising and marketing expenses consist of our marketing department costs and media and advertising costs to support center membership levels  in center businesses and our corporate businesses 
general and administrative expenses include costs relating to our centralized support functions  such as accounting  information systems  procurement  real estate and development and member relations 
our other operating expenses include the costs associated with our media  athletic events and nutritional product businesses  two restaurants and other corporate expenses  as well as gains or losses on our dispositions of assets 
our total operating expenses may vary from period to period depending on the number of new centers opened during that period  the number of centers engaged in presale activities and the performance of our in center businesses 
our primary capital expenditures relate to the construction of new centers and updating and maintaining our existing centers 
the land acquisition  construction and equipment costs for a current model center can vary considerably based on variability in land cost and the cost of construction labor  as well as whether or not a tennis area is included or whether or not we expand the gymnasium or add other facilities 
we perform maintenance and make improvements on our centers and equipment throughout each year 
we conduct a more thorough remodeling project at each center approximately every four to six years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
ultimate results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives and tax provisions 
we also use estimates for calculating the amortization period for deferred enrollment fee revenue and associated direct costs  which are based on the historical estimated average membership life 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition 
we receive a one time enrollment fee at the time a member joins and monthly membership dues for usage from our members 
the enrollment fees are non refundable after days 
enrollment 
table of contents fees and related direct expenses  primarily sales commissions  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over an estimated average membership life of months  which is based on historical membership experience 
we review the estimated average membership life on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances change 
changes in member behavior  competition  economic conditions and our performance may cause attrition levels to change  which could impact the estimated average membership life 
during  there was a substantial shift in our attrition activity  primarily as a result of macroeconomic pressures and a challenging consumer environment 
during the second quarter of  we changed our estimated average membership life from months to months 
the pressure continued throughout the second half of  therefore  we reduced the estimated average membership life to months at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
the estimated average membership life remained months during our attrition rate in improved slightly from a high of at the end of first quarter to at year end 
if the estimated average membership life had been months or months for the entire year ended december   the impact would have been less than million to net income 
if the direct expenses related to the enrollment fees exceed the enrollment fees for any center  the amount of direct expenses in excess of the enrollment fees are expensed in the current period instead of deferred over the average membership life 
the amount of direct expenses in excess of enrollment fees totaled million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
monthly membership dues paid in advance of a center opening are deferred until the center opens 
we only offer members month to month memberships and recognize as revenue the monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we provide services at each of our centers  including personal training  spa  cafe and other member services 
the revenue associated with these services is recognized at the time the service is performed 
personal training revenue received in advance of training sessions and the related commissions are deferred and recognized when services are performed 
other revenue  which includes revenue generated primarily from our media  athletic events and restaurant  is recognized when realized and earned 
media advertising revenue is recognized over the duration of the advertising placement 
for athletic events  revenue is generated primarily through sponsorship sales and registration fees 
athletic event revenue is recognized upon the completion of the event 
restaurant revenue is recognized at the point of sale to the customer

table of contents overall supervision by the management committee of bloomingdale llc  which is comprised of six members  two from each of the three members of the joint venture

additional details related to our interest in bloomingdale llc are provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda  ebitdar and free cash flow as measures of operating performance 
ebitda and ebitdar should not be considered substitutes for net income  cash flows provided by operating activities  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
the funds depicted by ebitda and ebitdar are not necessarily available for discretionary use if they are reserved for particular capital purposes  to maintain compliance with debt covenants  to service debt or to pay taxes 
we believe ebitda and ebitdar are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because both are widely accepted financial indicators of a company s ability to service its debt and we are required to comply with certain covenants and borrowing limitations that are based on variations of ebitda and ebitdar in certain of our financing documents  and both are widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda and or ebitdar as measurements of operating performance because they assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same consistent measurement basis of operating performance used by management  and as the basis for incentive bonuses paid to selected members of senior and center level management 
we have provided reconciliations of ebitda and ebitdar to net income in the section quarterly results unaudited  located immediately following the report of independent registered public accounting firm and in the selected financial data section 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure consisting of net cash provided by operating activities  less purchases of property and equipment 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies and does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance presented in accordance with gaap 
we use free cash flow as a measure of cash generated after spending on property and equipment 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
additional details related to free cash flow are provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures 
we believe free cash flow is useful to an investor in understanding our cash flow generation because free cash flow allows us to evaluate the cash generated by operations and the ability of our operations to fund investment items related to purchases of property and equipment  repay indebtedness  add to our cash balance  or to use in other discretionary activities  and if negative  free cash flow reflects the need for incremental financing activities or use of existing cash balances 

table of contents our management uses free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness  and in discussions with the investment community 
we have provided reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from operations in the section quarterly results unaudited  located immediately following the report of independent registered public accounting firm and in the selected financial data section 
seasonality of business seasonal trends have a limited effect on our overall business 
generally  we have experienced greater membership growth at the beginning of the year 
we also experience increased membership in certain centers during the summer pool season 
during the summer months  we also experience a slight increase in in center business activity with summer programming and operating expenses due to our outdoor aquatics operations 
we experience an increased level of membership attrition during the third and fourth quarters as the summer pool season ends and we enter the holiday season 
this can lead to a sequential decline in memberships during those quarters 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through various debt arrangements  sales of equity and cash flow provided by operations 
principal liquidity needs have included the development of new centers  debt service requirements and expenditures necessary to maintain and update our existing centers and associated fitness equipment 
we believe that we can satisfy our current and longer term debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements primarily with cash flow from operations  by the extension of the terms of or refinancing our existing debt facilities  through sale leaseback transactions and by continuing to raise long term debt or equity capital  although there can be no assurance that such actions can or will be completed 
in  we slowed our growth plans and began to generate free cash flow that allowed us to pay down a portion of our existing debt 
we plan to pay off or refinance debt scheduled to mature in and  including mortgage notes payable to teachers insurance and annuity association of america in july and our revolving credit facility in may  through cash flow from operations  refinancing existing debt facilities or issuing new debt 
our business model operates with negative working capital because we carry minimal accounts receivable due to our ability to have monthly membership dues paid by electronic draft  we defer enrollment fee revenue and we fund the construction of our new centers under standard arrangements with our vendors that are paid with proceeds from long term debt 
on february   we prepaid three of the mortgage notes payable to tiaa at the par amount of million 
concurrent with the prepayment  the mortgages were released on three of our centers 
additionally  the loan documents with tiaa were amended reducing the number of shares of our common stock our chief executive officer must retain from million to million 
as of the date of the prepayment  the obligations to tiaa under the remaining ten mortgage notes payable  totaling million  remain due in july credit rating 
we have never had public debt 
accordingly  we do not have  nor have we had  a credit rating as stated through standard and poor s rating services or moody s investor service

investing activities investing activities consist primarily of purchasing real property  constructing new centers and purchasing new fitness equipment

we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
financing activities during the year ended december    we had the following changes to our capital structure 
interest rate swap on september   we entered into an interest rate swap contract with jp morgan chase bank  jp that effectively fixed the rates paid on a total of million of variable rate borrowings from our revolving credit facility at plus the applicable spread depending on cash flow leverage ratio until october effective july   we revised the terms of the swap  reducing the fixed rate to plus the applicable spread 
all other terms of the swap remained the same 
the spread as of december  was

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total after in thousands long term debt obligations  excluding capital lease obligations capital lease obligations interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations interest expense obligations were calculated holding floating rate debt balances and interest rates constant at december  rates 
this includes the impact of our interest rate swap 
purchase obligations consist primarily of our contracts with construction subcontractors for the completion of the five large format centers under construction as of december   three of which we plan to open in  as well as contracts for the purchase of land 
in addition to the other long term liabilities presented in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
it became effective for our interim reporting period ended september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and  therefore  impact our consolidated cash flows and consolidated results of operations 
as of december   our net floating rate indebtedness was approximately million 
if long term floating interest rates were to have increased by basis points during the year ended december   our interest costs would have increased by approximately million 
if short term interest rates were to have increased by basis points during the year ended december   our interest income from cash equivalents would have increased by less than million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness and cash equivalents balances at december
