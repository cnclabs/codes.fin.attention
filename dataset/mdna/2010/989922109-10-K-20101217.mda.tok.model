we are committed to developing technologies that help advance emergency care and save lives  while increasing clinical and operational efficiencies 
with products for defibrillation and monitoring  circulation and cpr feedback  data management  fluid resuscitation  and therapeutic temperature management  we provide a comprehensive set of technologies which help clinicians  ems and fire professionals  and lay rescuers treat victims needing resuscitation and critical care 
we intend for this discussion and analysis to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of october  and for the year then ended and the notes accompanying those consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal consisted of weeks 
our three months ended january  included the additional week and  therefore  consisted of weeks  while the three months ended december  and december  consisted of weeks 
we estimate that the revenue and expense impact of the additional week was approximately million each during the three months ended january  executive overview we ended fiscal with approximately million of cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
we completed fiscal with revenues of approximately million 
revenue results reflected a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately million compared to fiscal although we continue to experience softness in the north american hospital and pre hospital capital equipment business due to general economic conditions  we did see some modest improvement in the north american hospital capital equipment market in fiscal our capital equipment pricing was higher in fiscal than in fiscal while sales volume was lower than we would expect 
in fiscal  we saw spending constraints due to economic uncertainty and had offered more incentives to customers during fiscal we continue to believe that since our professional defibrillator products are a standard of care and the installed base of defibrillators continues to age  such spending has merely been delayed rather than lost 
our lifevest revenue grew in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continue to invest in this product 
our new temperature management business  which was acquired in may of  contributed approximately million of revenue for fiscal and million in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales our net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
net sales by customer product categories in fiscal and were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the international market lifevest to the north america and international markets total sales our sales to the north american hospital market increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth is primarily attributable to increased revenue from sales of professional defibrillators and an increased volume derived from our temperature management business  which benefited from a full year of revenue as compared to five months of revenue in fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the volume of us military big government sales 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in pre hospital sales was primarily due to increased sales of professional defibrillators as our product pricing returned to what we believe are more typical levels 

table of contents international sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in international sales was due to an increased volume of sales of aeds  temperature management products and the autopulse 
the increased volume of sales also included a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  excluding canada  of approximately million 
the increased volume of sales was driven primarily by sales growth in australia  latin america  europe and japan 
total rental revenue of the lifevest product increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increased volume is attributable to increased acceptance of the product  improved productivity of existing sales representatives and to the increase in sales personnel as we continue to penetrate this large market potential 
total sales of aeds to all of our markets increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this growth is primarily attributable to increased international sales 
total sales of the autopulse product to all of our markets increased to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal an increase in sales volume of the autopulse in the international market was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume in the north american pre hospital market  which we continue to believe is due to funding restrictions within the public agencies for capital equipment 
gross margins cost of sales consists primarily of material  labor  overhead  and freight associated with the manufacturing of our various medical equipment devices  data collection software and disposables 
these products are primarily sold to the hospital  pre hospital  and international markets 
we lease the lifevest product and sell our data collection software mainly to the pre hospital market 
overall  gross margins for fiscal increased to approximately compared to in fiscal approximately two percentage points of the increase was attributable to higher pricing 
other factors affecting the fluctuation in gross margin each individually represented less than one percentage point of our overall gross margin  including the positive impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the lifevest business 
our gross margin tends to fluctuate from period to period as a result of unit volume levels  mix of product and customer class  geographical mix  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and overall market conditions 
backlog we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at the end of the prior quarter 
backlog was approximately million at september  typically  our backlog decreases during the first and second quarters  remains relatively flat during the third quarter  and increases during the fourth quarter due to the purchasing practices of our customers 
during fiscal  we had higher levels of backlog earlier in the year and a lower level at the end of the year due to variation of the timing of orders over the course of the year relative to our shipments 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
costs and expenses operating expenses in fiscal and were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses 
table of contents as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased approximately as compared to fiscal as we gained efficiency with our growth 
the dollar spending for selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended october  compared to the same period last year 
the dollar spending increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and travel expenses for selling and marketing employees  primarily for the lifevest business 
an additional increase of approximately million was due to our temperature management business which was purchased from alsius in may the extra week in fiscal and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations both contributed an additional increase of approximately million to selling and marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal remained flat as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended october  compared to the previous year

other contributors include increased personnel related costs including salaries and stock based compensation for research and development employees and expenses associated with the arrangement with welch allyn 
investment and other income expense investment and other income expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease primarily reflected significant foreign exchange gains on marking our foreign denominated intercompany receivable balances to the spot rate at the end of fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal the increased rate resulted from a discrete benefit provided by the research and development tax credit being applied to expected annual earnings in fiscal the prior year effective tax rate benefited from the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit  retroactively from january   during the first quarter of fiscal this extension allowed a full year tax credit estimate for fiscal to be included in our fiscal rate calculation along with a discrete period adjustment of approximately  recognized during the first quarter of fiscal to record the tax credit related to the retroactive application of the credit extension 
the fiscal annual rate only contains one quarter of a full year credit 
the increase in the current year rate was partially offset by the release of approximately  of tax liabilities due to the expiration of tax statutes  completion of tax audits and the resolution of uncertain tax positions in the third quarter of fiscal additionally  during the third quarter of  we undertook a detailed review of our international tax positions and concluded that our deferred tax liabilities should be decreased by approximately  this adjustment was immaterial to all prior periods 
on october   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no

our sales to the north american pre hospital market decreased million  or  in fiscal the decrease in pre hospital sales was primarily due to decreased volume of sales of aeds of approximately million and professional defibrillators of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by a modest increased volume of data management software products of approximately million 
total sales of the lifevest product increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales by our international subsidiaries  excluding canada  totaled approximately million 
the constant currency growth was attributable primarily to international sales of our newly acquired temperature management product and increased volume of aeds 
the increased volume of sales was driven primarily by sales growth in france  the uk and asia pacific 

table of contents total sales of the autopulse product to all of our markets decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we believe this reflected the current difficult economic environment and the constraints on capital spending by hospitals and ems agencies

the dollar spending for selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  compared to the same period last year 
the dollar spending increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million related to increased personnel related costs  including salaries  commissions and stock based compensation for selling and marketing employees  primarily for the lifevest business

income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal the decreased rate resulted from a discrete benefit provided by the research and development tax credit being applied to expected annual earnings 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  congress extended the research and development tax credit which allowed us to record seven quarters worth of credits in fiscal versus only one quarter of credits in fiscal on october   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
codified within fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes overall 
as a result of this adoption  we recognized approximately  of increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits

table of contents financial condition liquidity and capital resources we believe our overall financial condition remains strong 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at october  totaled million compared with million at september  we continue to have no long term debt 
as we have previously stated  we have used cash  and it is possible we will use additional cash  to assist customers who transition to our products with various financing arrangements 
we also may use cash to assist creditworthy customers with various financing arrangements as a result of the current difficult liquidity and credit environment 
cash requirements we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid short term investments  together with future cash to be generated by operations and amounts available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe we have  and will maintain  sufficient cash to meet future contingency payments related to the lifecor and infusion dynamics acquisitions 
the final payment to lifecor  which we believe will approximate million and which will be made in fiscal in respect of fiscal results  may be made in cash or our common stock at our option 
we may also need to use these funds in the future for potential acquisitions 
sources and uses of cash to assist with the discussion  the following table presents the abbreviated cash flows for the years ended october   september   and september  s omitted net income changes not affecting cash changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period cash and cash equivalents end of period operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately million in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher accounts receivable balances and higher purchases of inventory in support of increased levels of business 
this decrease was partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expense balances and higher net income in fiscal investing activities cash used in investing activities increased approximately million in fiscal to million as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase in the use of cash was primarily attributable to a 
table of contents smaller amount of cash being generated from net sales of marketable securities in fiscal as compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  was attributable to more cash paid out in fiscal as contingent consideration for prior year acquisitions 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the absence of any acquisitions and a lower level of cash used for additions to property and equipment made in fiscal as compared to fiscal financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased approximately million for fiscal in comparison to approximately  in the previous year 
the change reflects a substantially higher number of stock options exercised during fiscal approximately  shares exercised in compared to approximately  shares exercised in 
investments in march  we acquired substantially all the assets of infusion dynamics 
under the terms of the acquisition  we are obligated to make additional earn out payments through contingencies based on performance of the acquired business 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the future payments to be made cannot be determined 
as these contingencies are resolved and the consideration is distributable  we record the fair value of the additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired assets 
our earn out payments  in the form of cash  for fiscal and were both approximately  we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for fiscal of approximately  which is expected to be paid in cash during the first half of fiscal we exercised our option to acquire the business and assets of lifecor and acquired the business and assets on april  we assumed lifecor s outstanding debt plus an additional million owed to us  which was cancelled and certain stated liabilities 
we paid the third party debt in april we agreed to pay additional consideration in the form of earn out payments to lifecor based upon future revenue growth of the acquired business over a five year period 
earn out payments to lifecor were made in the form of cash for fiscal and fiscal in the approximate amounts of million and million  respectively 
for both annual earn outs  the additional consideration was accrued during the fiscal period when earned and paid out in the subsequent fiscal period 
we have accrued  but not yet paid  an earn out for fiscal of approximately million  which is expected to be paid during the first half of fiscal in the form of cash and or our common stock 
the fiscal payment will be the final earn out payment for the lifecor acquisition 
on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of the intravascular temperature management business of alsius 
the assets acquired include intellectual property relating to the business  other intangibles  inventories and fixed assets 
we assumed warranty and service contract obligations relating to alsius s installed base of products 
we consolidated the operations of the acquired business into our sunnyvale  california subsidiary  zoll circulation  inc we believe that the acquisition of the temperature management technology and products from alsius  in combination with the technology and know how we acquired previously through the purchase of assets from radiant medical  inc in  creates the opportunity for us to become a major participant in the temperature management business 
no voting interest was acquired in the acquisition 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash to alsius 
debt instruments and related covenants we maintain an unsecured working capital line of credit with our bank 
under this working capital line  we may borrow  on a demand basis and with no expiration date  up to million 
this line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor plus 
no borrowings were outstanding on this line during fiscal there are no covenants related to this line of credit 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and one minimum purchase commitment contract for a critical raw material component 
the table below in the next section titled contractual obligations and other commercial commitments shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  in general  we choose to lease our facilities instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years after years non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the company leases certain office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the company s office leases are subject to adjustments based on actual floor space occupied 
the leases also require payment of real estate taxes and operating costs 
the company has an option to purchase the zoll lifevest manufacturing facility located in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
in addition to the office leases  the company leases automobiles for business use by a portion of the sales force 
the company s executive headquarters and defibrillator and fluid resuscitation manufacturing operations are located in chelmsford  massachusetts 
the chelmsford facility is mainly covered by an eight year lease  beginning july  and expiring on june   as well as two smaller subleases that also expire on june  the agreements do not contain a renewal period and provide that the company pay a pro rata amount of the landlord s real estate tax and operating expenses based upon square footage 
the main lease also provided the company with an allowance of approximately million for any construction costs associated with relocation efforts to the leased facility 
this reimbursement has been recorded as a deferred lease incentive within accrued expenses and other liabilities and is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the lease 
any leasehold improvements made as part of the relocation have been capitalized as leasehold improvements within property and equipment and are being amortized over the eight year life of the lease 
the company is currently negotiating a new year lease with the lessor for the chelmsford facility as the current leases expire on june  purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based upon our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon future performance and growth of sales are not included in the table above 
these include the additional earn out payments for the assets of infusion dynamics through fiscal because these earn out payments are based upon the growth of sales over several years  a reasonable estimate of the future payment obligations cannot be determined 
hedging activities we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding at october  in the notional amount of approximately million euros  serving to mitigate the foreign currency risk of a substantial portion of our euro 
table of contents denominated intercompany balances 
the net settlement amount of this contract on october   is an unrealized loss of approximately  which is included in earnings within investment and other income  net 
we had net realized gains losses of  million and million from foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal  and  respectively  which are included in earnings within investment and other income  net 
critical accounting estimates our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and to make difficult and subjective judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  and our most critical accounting estimates include accounts receivable reserves  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  fair value measurements  the valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies  which include revenue recognition and those that require significant estimates and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions  conditions  and methods of application in preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of cardiac resuscitation and temperature management therapy devices  disposable electrodes  catheters and accessories are recognized when a signed non cancelable purchase order exists  the product is shipped  title and risk have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
circumstances that generally preclude the immediate recognition of revenue include shipping terms of fob destination or the existence of a customer acceptance clause in a contract based upon customer inspection of the product 
in these instances  revenue is deferred until adequate documentation is obtained to ensure that these criteria have been fulfilled 
similarly  revenues from the sales of our products to distributors fall under the same guidelines 
for all significant orders placed by our distributors  we require an approved purchase order  we perform a credit review  and we ensure that the terms on the purchase order or contract are proper and do not include any contingencies which preclude revenue recognition 
we do not typically offer any special right of return  stock rotation or price protection to our distributors or end customers 
for sales in which payment extends beyond a twelve month period  we generally recognize revenue at its net present value using an imputed rate of interest based on our experience of successful collection on these terms without concession 
our sales to customers often include a device  disposables and other accessories 
for the vast majority of our shipments  all deliverables are shipped together 
however  in cases some elements of a multiple element arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date 
in september  the fasb amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and include some software elements 
we adopted this new guidance prospectively during the first quarter of under the historical accounting guidance  fasb asc  multiple element arrangements formerly emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we deferred the fair value of the undelivered elements and only recognized the revenue related to the delivered elements if we had established fair value for the undelivered elements 
if we had not established fair value for any undelivered elements  the entire order was deferred 
under the new guidance of asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  fair value as the measurement criteria is replaced with the term selling price and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
asu no 
also eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining the allocation of arrangement consideration 
for multi element arrangements  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  
table of contents we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
our process for determining an esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the adoption of asu no 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including training  installation  consulting and maintenance  which consists of product support services  and unspecified upgrade rights collectively  post contract customer support  pcs 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition formerly sop 
license fee revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from maintenance agreements and upgrade rights are recognized ratably over the period of service 
revenue for services  such as software deployment and consulting  is recognized when the service is performed 
our software arrangements contain multiple elements  which include software products  services and pcs 
generally  we do not sell computer hardware products with our software products 
we will occasionally facilitate the hardware purchase by providing information to the customer such as where to purchase the equipment 
we generally do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software products 
we do  however  have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for items such as consulting and technical services  deployment and pcs based upon the price charged when such items are sold separately 
accordingly  for transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  we use the residual method 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
we do not typically ship any of our software products to distributors or resellers 
our software products are sold by our sales force directly to the end user 
we may sell software to system integrators who provide complete solutions to end users on a contract basis 
on september   we entered into a state of readiness contract awarded by the us government to supply defibrillators on short notice 
a similar contract with the us government expired on september  based upon the award  we expect to receive two types of payments from the us government 
the first payment of approximately million  which was received in during the first half of fiscal and is carried within deferred revenue on our balance sheet as a liability under government contracts  is to reimburse us for the cost to acquire inventories required to meet potentially short notice delivery schedules 
we also expect to receive a payment from the us government to compensate us for managing the purchase  build  storage and inventory rotation process 
we expect that this payment will also compensate us for making future production capacity available 
the portion of this payment associated with the purchase and build aspects of the contract we expect will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis while the portion of the payment for the storage  inventory rotation and facilities charge we expect will be recognized ratably over the contract period 
the contract has a one year term with up to an additional four one year extensions 
under this contract  the us government has two options to acquire defibrillators 
the us government may buy on a replenishment basis  which means we will record a sale under our normal us government price list and maintain our state of readiness  or the us government may buy on a non replenishment basis  which will generally allow us to obtain normal margins but will reduce our future obligations under this arrangement 
for those markets for which we sell separately priced extended warranties  revenue is deferred and recognized over the applicable warranty period  based upon the estimated selling price of the contract 

table of contents we also generate rental revenue from our lifevest product 
doctors prescribe the lifevest equipment for use by their patients 
the patients then rent the lifevest product from us for use over a prescribed period of time  typically between to months 
the patients are generally covered by health plan contracts  which typically contract with a third party payor that agrees to pay based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
third party payors are entities such as insurance companies  governmental agencies  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers 
the rental income is recognized ratably over the rental period 
allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances trade in allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  for which related provisions are included in bad debt expense  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
specifically identified reserves are charged to selling and marketing expenses 
provisions for general reserves are charged to general and administrative expenses 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  communications with the customers  credit history and current economic conditions 
we also maintain an estimated reserve for potential future product returns and discounts given related to trade ins and to current period product sales  which is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included in the accounts receivable allowance amounts on our balance sheet 
as of october   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of million 
we believe our reported allowances at october  are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we might need to record additional allowances  resulting in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination would be made 
although we are not typically contractually obligated to provide trade in allowances under existing sales contracts  we may offer such allowances when negotiating new sales arrangements 
when pricing sales transactions  we contemplate both cash consideration and the net realizable value of any used equipment to be traded in 
the trade in allowance value stated in a sales order may differ from the estimated net realizable value of the underlying equipment 
any excess in the trade in allowance over the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment represents additional sales discount 
we account for product sales transactions by recording as revenue the total of the cash consideration and the estimated net realizable value of the trade in equipment less a normal profit margin 
any difference between the estimated net realizable value of the used equipment and the trade in allowance granted is recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the sale 
used zoll equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our reserves to ensure that the balance sheet value associated with our trade in equipment is properly stated 
if the trade in equipment is a competitor s product  we will usually resell the product to a third party distributor who specializes in the sale of used medical equipment  without any refurbishment 
we typically do not recognize a profit upon the resale of a competitor s used equipment  although as a result of the inherent nature of the estimation process  we could recognize either a nominal gain or loss 
warranty reserves our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  usually one year for pre hospital and international customers and five years for hospital customers 
revenue is deferred for pre hospital customers who receive warranties beyond one year 
such revenue is then recognized over the period of extended warranty 
we provide for the estimated 
table of contents cost of product warranties at the time product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the costs that we estimate include material  labor  and shipping 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at october  is adequate to cover future costs for the servicing of our products sold through that date and under warranty 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is in excess of future needs 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
we estimate excess inventory amounts by reviewing quantities on hand and comparing those quantities to sales forecasts for the next months  identifying historical service usage trends  and matching that usage with the installed base quantities to estimate future needs 
at october   our inventory was recorded at net realizable value requiring reserves of million  or of our million gross inventories 
fair value measurements during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly referenced as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
this accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements 
we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we elected to defer implementation of fasb asc as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until fiscal the implementation of fasb asc as it relates to non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities  which are required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions and credit risk 
during the first quarter of  we adopted fasb asc  financial instruments formerly referenced as sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value 
we have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments 
refer to note l  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional information 
goodwill at october   we had approximately million in goodwill  primarily resulting from our acquisitions of the assets of lifecor corporation approximately million  revivant  inc approximately 
table of contents million  certain assets of bio key international  inc approximately million  the assets of infusion dynamics  inc approximately million  and the assets of alsius corporation approximately million 
we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
additionally  we periodically review our goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
for our fiscal year end annual impairment assessment  we identified four reporting units which have goodwill allocated to them and are ultimately aggregated up to our single reportable segment 
fair value is determined based on the income approach  which is an estimate of the discounted future cash flows expected from the reporting units 
we considered the use of the market approach and the cost approach  but we concluded that these methods were not appropriate for valuing our reporting units due to the lack of relevant and available market comparisons 
the income approach is based on the projected cash flows that are discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating cash performance 
the key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates and discount rate assumptions 
the projected cash flows use internally developed revenue and expense forecasts and assumptions 
the discount rate used is the average estimated value of a market participant s cost of capital and debt  derived using customary market metrics 
other significant assumptions include terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we also compare our overall fair value to our market capitalization 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to our application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
the foregoing assumptions were consistent with our long term performance 
however  these assumptions could deviate materially from actual results 
our annual goodwill impairment testing did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded implied fair values 
we believe that none of our reporting units has a material amount of goodwill that is at risk of failing future impairment tests 
for each of the reporting units  the level of excess fair value over the carrying value exceeded at least at the end of our fiscal year 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment on the part of management about future revenues  expenses and other assumptions that contribute to the net cash flows of the reporting units 
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in impairment tests  these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets  to assess potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination includes evaluation of factors such as current market value  business climate and future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in assessing potential impairment and to record an impairment loss based on fair value in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires judgment on the part of management 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which the determination is made 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of fasb asc  income tax  formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on october  the provision contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
this provision also provides guidance on classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  we measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize cost over the requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
safe harbor statement certain statements contained herein constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the sec and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  see  plan  future  may  will  could  and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
particularly  the company s expectations regarding its business  operational results  future operational liquidity  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  and capital requirements are forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the actions of competitors  the acceptance of our products in their respective markets  adverse economic conditions  and those other risks and uncertainties contained in item a in part i of this annual report on form k entitled risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that consist of money market accounts  us treasuries and fixed rate  asset backed corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to three years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and that the fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  germany  austria  australia  and new zealand 
these subsidiaries transact business in their functional or local currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our currency transaction exposures 
these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow  fair value or net investment hedges under fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 
these derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk since gains and losses on those derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
we had one forward exchange contract outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros at october  the contract serves as a hedge of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the fair value of this contract at october  was approximately million  resulting in an unrealized loss of  a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the euro derivative foreign exchange contract outstanding at october  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would decrease by approximately  resulting in a total loss on the contract of approximately  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would increase by approximately  resulting in a total gain on the contract of approximately  any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the analysis below
