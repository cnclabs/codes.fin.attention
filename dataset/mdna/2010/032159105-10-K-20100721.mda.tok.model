item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks the company faces  and other risks include those not presently known as well as those that are currently considered to be less significant 
general economic risks the effects of the global economic crisis may continue to impact the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the global economic crisis has caused a general tightening of the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
these macroeconomic developments have negatively affected  and could continue to negatively affect  the company s business  operating results or financial condition in a number of ways 
for example  potential real estate developers may be unable to obtain financing which could cause them to delay  decrease or cancel purchases of land from the company  and revenues from subscriptions and advertising sources may further deteriorate such that magazine publishers cease publishing certain titles and thus no longer need the company s services 
the deterioration of the credit and capital markets may adversely impact the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  which may hinder or prevent the company from meeting its future operational and capital needs 
global financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption during the past months  and the debt and equity capital markets were exceedingly distressed and difficult to access during much of this period 
these issues have made  and will likely continue to make  it more difficult to obtain financing than has historically been the case 
if future funding is not available when needed or to the extent required  or if it is available only on unfavorable terms  this might adversely affect the company s ability to meet its operating needs or its future capital expenditures 
risks related to the company s real estate operations the company s real estate assets are concentrated in one market  rio rancho  new mexico  meaning the company s results of operations and future growth may be limited or affected by economic changes in that market 
substantially all of the company s real estate assets are located in rio rancho  which is adjacent to albuquerque  new mexico 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company could be affected by changes in economic conditions in this region from time to time  including regional economic contraction due to  among other things  the failure or downturn of key industries and employers 
the company s results of operations  future growth or both may be adversely affected if the demand for residential or commercial real estate declines in the rio rancho area as a result of changes in economic conditions 
for example  real estate land sales have declined from million in to million in  as builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in ri o rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
a downturn in the business of rio rancho s largest employer may adversely affect the company s real estate development business there 
intel corporation intel is the largest employer in rio rancho and operates a large semiconductor manufacturing facility there 
although intel has made substantial investments in the rio rancho plant in recent years  it has reduced its employment there from approximately  at april  to approximately  at april  as it has adjusted to current business conditions 
if intel s presence in rio rancho were to continue to diminish for any reason  such as in response to a downturn in its semiconductor manufacturing business  the rio rancho real estate market and consequently the company s land development business located there may continue to be adversely affected 
as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company s land development activities in that market may be subject to greater limitations than they have been historically 
when the company acquired its core real estate inventory in rio rancho over years ago  the area was not developed and had a low population 
as of april   rio rancho was the third largest city in new mexico and had a population of approximately  as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company may be unable to engage in development activities comparable to those the company has engaged in historically 
local community or political groups may oppose the company s development plans or require modification of those plans  which could cause delays or increase the cost of the company s development projects 
in addition  zoning density limitations  slow growth provisions or other land use regulations implemented by state  city or local governments could further restrict the company s development activities or those of its homebuilder customers  or could adversely affect financial returns from a given project  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s remaining rio rancho real estate is not all in contiguous blocks  which may adversely affect the company s ability to sell lots at levels comparable with the levels it experienced prior to the sales downturn 
of the approximately  acres in rio rancho that the company owned at april   approximately  acres were in contiguous blocks that are being developed or are suitable for development  and approximately  acres were in areas with a high concentration of ownership  where the company owns more than of the lots in the area  suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government 
the balance is in scattered lots  where the company owns less than of the lots in the area  which may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or that the company may offer for sale individually or in small groups 
as the company s land sales continue a nd the number of the company s contiguous and highly concentrated lots diminishes  the company s ability to continue to be in a position to sell lots and generate land sale revenues at satisfactory levels may be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s real estate assets are diminishing over time  meaning long term growth in the real estate business will require the acquisition of additional real estate assets  possibly by expanding into new markets 
substantially all of the company s real estate revenues are derived from sales of the company s core inventory in rio rancho 
this property was acquired more than years ago  and each time the company develops and sells real estate to customers in rio rancho  the company s real estate assets diminish 
as of april   the company owned approximately  acres in rio rancho out of an original purchase of approximately  acres 
the continuity and future growth of the company s real estate business will require that the company acquire new properties in or near rio rancho or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate development business 
while the company holds two properties in colorado  it has not for many years made any significant attempt to ide ntify a development opportunity similar to the one the company has undertaken in rio rancho  and there can be no assurance that the company will identify such an opportunity in another market 
if the company does not acquire new real estate assets  its real estate holdings will continue to diminish  which will adversely affect the company s ability to continue its real estate operations at a significant level 
the company may not be able to acquire properties or develop them successfully 
if the company is able to identify real estate development opportunities outside of rio rancho  the success of the company s real estate segment will still depend in large part upon its ability to acquire additional properties on satisfactory terms and to develop them successfully 
if the company is unable to do so  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the acquisition  ownership and development of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect the company s results of operations  including the risks that the company may not be able to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors who may have greater capital or better access to cash than the company has  the company may not be able to obtain or renew financing on acceptable terms  or at all  an adverse change in market conditions during the interval between acquisition and sale of a property may result in a lower than originally anticipated profit  the company may underestimate the cost of development required to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property  acquired properties may be located in new markets where the company may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  a lack of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures  and the company may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into its existing operations 
the company s real estate development activities have been primarily limited to a single market  and it may face substantially more experienced competition in acquiring and developing real estate in new markets 
since the company s real estate acquisition and development activities have been primarily limited to the rio rancho market  the company does not have extensive experience in acquiring real estate in other markets or engaging in development activities in multiple markets simultaneously 
should the company seek to acquire additional real estate in new markets  competition from other potential purchasers of real estate could adversely affect the company s operations 
many of these entities may have substantially greater experience than the company has in identifying  acquiring and developing real estate opportunities in other markets and in managing real estate developments in multiple markets 
these entities may also have greater financial resources than the company has and may be able to pay more than the company can or acc ept more risk than the company is willing to accept to acquire real estate 
these entities also may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the costs or the geographic concentration of their investments 
this competition may prevent the company from acquiring the real estate assets the company seeks  or increase the cost of properties that the company does acquire 
competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to the company or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
the company will likely compete for real estate investment opportunities with  among others  insurance companies  pension and investment funds  partnerships  real estate or housing developers  investment companies  real estate investment trusts and owner occupants 
properties that the company acquires may have defects that are unknown to the company 
although the company generally performs due diligence on prospective properties before they are acquired  and on a periodic basis after acquisition  any of the properties the company may acquire may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to the company that could adversely affect the property s value or revenue potential or  in the case of environmental or other factors  impose liability on the company  which could be significant 
the company is subject to substantial legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land and requires government approvals  which may be denied  and thus the company may encounter difficulties in obtaining entitlements on a timely basis  which could limit its ability to sell land 
there are many legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land  which may delay the start of planned development activities  increase the company s expenses or limit the company s customers development activities 
development activities performed in connection with real estate sales include obtaining necessary governmental approvals  acquiring access to water supplies  installing utilities and necessary storm drains and building or improving roads 
numerous local  state and federal statutes  ordinances and rules and regulations  including those concerning zoning  resource protection and environmental laws  regulate these tasks 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the governmental authorities that regulate these matters and from whom the company must obtain necessary approvals 
the approval process can be lengthy and delays can increase the company s costs  as well as the costs for the primary customers of the company s real estate business residential and commercial developers 
failure to obtain necessary approvals may significantly adversely affect the company s real estate development activities and its results of operations 
the company may be subject to environmental liability 
various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners and operators for the costs of investigating  cleaning up and removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property 
in the company s role as a property owner or developer  the company could be held liable for such costs 
this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
if the company fails to disclose environmental issues  it could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of the property 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
if the company incurs any such liability that is material  its results of operations would be adversely affected 
increases in taxes or governmental fees may increase the company s costs 
also  adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for land for commercial and residential development 
increases in real estate taxes and other local governmental fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space and road improvements or to provide low and moderate income housing  would increase the company s costs and have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  increases in local real estate taxes or changes in income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives could adversely affect homebuilders potential customer demand and could adversely affect future land sales by the company to those homebuilders 
unless the city of rio rancho supplements its current water supply  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land may be adversely affected 
all of the company s future rio rancho land development will require water service from the city of rio rancho or from another source 
while the city has not denied any development in the past due to a shortage of water supply  it has expressed concerns that its current water supply cannot support growth indefinitely 
although the city is currently pursuing various methods to supplement its water supply  if it is unsuccessful  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land could be adversely affected 
real estate is a cyclical industry  and the company s results of operations could be adversely affected during cyclical downturns in the industry 
during periods of economic expansion  the real estate industry typically benefits from an increased demand for developable land 
in contrast  during periods of economic contraction  the real estate industry is typically adversely affected by a decline in demand 
for example  increased rates of mortgage defaults that began in early calendar led to significant losses for the companies offering such mortgages and contributed to a severe and continuing downturn in the residential housing market 
further  real estate development projects typically begin  and financial and other resources are committed  long before a real estate project comes to market  which could be during a time when the real estate market is depressed 
there can be no assurance that an increase in demand or an economic expansion will occur or b e sustained in the rio rancho market  where the company s core real estate business is based and operates  or in any other new market into which the company expands its real estate operations 
any of the following among other factors  including those mentioned elsewhere in this report could cause a general decline in the demand for residential or commercial real estate which  in turn  could contribute to a severe downturn in the real estate development industry that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations periods of general economic slowdown or recession  changes in government regulation  rising interest rates and a decline in the general availability or affordability of mortgage financing  adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  shifts in population away from the markets that the company serves  tax law changes  including potential limits on  or elimination of  the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense  real property taxes and employee relocation expenses  and acts of god  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
changing market conditions may adversely affect companies in the real estate industry  which rely upon credit in order to finance their purchases of land from the company 
changes in interest rates and other economic factors can dramatically affect the availability of capital for the company s developer customers 
residential and commercial developers to whom the company frequently sells land typically rely upon third party financing to provide the capital necessary for their acquisition of land 
changes in economic and other external market conditions can and have resulted in the inability of developers to obtain suitable financing  which could adversely impact the company s ability to sell land  or force the company to sell land at lower prices  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
changes in general economic  real estate development or other business conditions may adversely affect the company s business and its financial results 
a significant percentage of the company s real estate revenues are derived from customers in the residential homebuilding business  which is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and factors such as the level of employment  consumer confidence  consumer income  availability of mortgage financing and interest rates 
adverse changes in these conditions have decreased demand for homes generally  and may continue to do so  affecting the pricing of homes and in turn the price of land sold to developers  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
a number of contracts for individual rio rancho home site sales made prior to require the company to exchange land in an area that is serviced by utilities for land in areas where utilities are not installed 
in connection with certain individual rio rancho home site sales made prior to  if water  electric and telephone utilities have not reached the lot site when a purchaser is ready to build a home  the company is obligated to exchange a lot in an area then serviced by such utilities for the lot of the purchaser  without cost to the purchaser 
although this has not been the case in the past  if the company were to experience a large number of requests for such exchanges in the future  the company s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if subcontractors are not available to assist in completing the company s land development projects  the company may not be able to complete those projects on a timely basis 
the development of land on a timely basis is critical to the company s ability to complete development projects in accordance with the company s contractual obligations 
the availability of subcontractors in the markets in which the company operates can be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the general demand for these subcontractors by other developers 
if subcontractors are not available when the company requires their services  the company may experience delays or be forced to seek alternative suppliers  which may increase costs or adversely affect the company s ability to sell land on a timely basis 
land investments are generally illiquid  and the company may not be able to sell the company s properties when it is economically or otherwise important to do so 
land investments generally cannot be sold quickly  and the company s ability to sell properties may be affected by market conditions 
the company may not be able to diversify or vary its portfolio promptly in accordance with its strategies or in response to economic or other conditions 
the company s ability to pay down debt  reduce interest costs and acquire properties is dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the deadlines the company has established for each property 
risks related to the company s media services operations the company s publisher customers face business pressures from reduced advertising revenues and increased costs for paper  printing and postal rates 
these factors could have a negative affect on their operating income  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
an important source of revenue for the magazine publishing industry  the principal industry served by the company  is advertising 
as a result of the economic slowdown  there has been a well publicized reduction in advertising at all levels which has caused a higher attrition rate of magazine titles than has been previously experienced 
in addition  the company s publisher customers principal raw material is paper 
paper and printing prices have fluctuated over the past several years  and significant unanticipated increases in paper prices could adversely affect a publisher customer s operating income 
postage for magazine distribution and direct solicitation is another significant operating expense of the company s publisher customers  which primarily use the us po stal service to distribute their products 
any continued softness in advertising revenues or significant increases in paper costs  printing costs or postal rates that publishers are not able to offset could have a negative affect on their operating income and number of titles published  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
the company s media services operations could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in the newsstand distribution channel 
the company extends credit to various newsstand distribution services customers  whose credit worthiness and financial position may be affected by changes in economic or other external conditions 
financial instruments that may potentially subject the company to a significant concentration of risk primarily consist of trade accounts receivable from wholesalers in the magazine distribution industry 
a small number of wholesalers are responsible for a significant percentage of the wholesale magazine distribution business in the united states 
recently  there has been instability in the wholesaler channel that has led to one major wholesaler abandoning the business and to certain disruptions to magazine distribution 
there is the possibility of further consolidation among these wholesalers and insolvency o r non payment of its obligations by one or more of these wholesalers  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  due to the significant concentration in the industry  should there be a disruption in the wholesale channel  it could impede the company s ability to distribute magazines to the retail marketplace 
almost all of the company s revenues in the company s newsstand distribution services business are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  and an error in estimating expected returns could cause a misstatement of revenues for the period affected 
as is customary in the magazine distribution industry  almost all of the company s revenues in its newsstand distribution services business segment are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  meaning that customers may return unsold copies of magazines for credit 
during the company s fiscal year ended april   customers ultimately returned for credit approximately of the magazines initially distributed by the company 
the company recognizes revenues from the distribution of magazines at the time of delivery to the wholesalers  less a reserve for estimated returns that is based on historical experience and recent sales data on an issue by issue basis 
although the company has the contractual right to return these magazines for offsetting credits from the publishers from whom the magaz ines are purchased  an error in estimating the percentage of returns at the end of an accounting period could have the effect of understating or overstating revenues in the period affected  which misstatement would have to be adjusted in a subsequent period when the actual return information becomes known 
the introduction and increased popularity of alternative technologies for the distribution of news  entertainment and other information and the resulting shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from print to other media has adversely affected the company s media services business segments 
revenues in the company s media services business segments are principally derived from services the company performs for traditional publishers 
historically  a reduction in the demand for the company s newsstand distribution services due to lower sales of magazines at newsstands has often been at least partially offset by an increase in demand for the company s subscription fulfillment services as consumers affected by the reduction in newsstand distribution instead sought publications through subscription 
however  the distribution of news  entertainment and other information via the internet has become increasingly popular  and consumers increasingly rely on electronic readers  personal computers  cellular phones and other electronic devices for such information 
the resulting redu ction in demand for traditional print media and the shift of advertising dollars from traditional print media to online media has adversely affected the publishing industry in general and has had a negative impact on both the company s subscription fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services segments 
competitive pressures may result in a decrease in the company s revenues and profitability 
the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution services businesses are highly competitive  and some of the company s competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than the company s 
the company experiences significant price competition in the markets in which it competes 
competition in the company s media services businesses may come not only from other service providers  but also from the company s customers  who may choose to develop their own internal subscription fulfillment or newsstand distribution operations  thereby reducing demand for the company s services 
competitive pressures could cause the company s media services businesses to lose market share or result in significant price erosion that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s operating results depend in part on successful research  development and marketing of new or improved services and data processing capabilities and could suffer if the company is not able to continue to successfully implement new technologies 
the company operates in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change  and must therefore continue to invest in developing technologies and to improve various existing systems in order to remain competitive 
there are substantial uncertainties associated with the company s efforts to develop new technologies and services for the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution markets the company serves 
the company makes significant investments in new information processing technologies and services that may or may not prove to be profitable 
even if these developments are profitable  the operating margins resulting from their application would not necessarily result in an improvement over the company s historical margins 
the company may not be able to successfully introduce new services and data processing capabilities on a timely and cost effective basis 
the success of new and improved services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by the publishers and other customers with whom the company conducts business 
the company s media services businesses are affected  to varying degrees  by technological changes and shifts in customer demand 
these changes result in the transition of services provided and increase the importance of being first to market with new services and information processing innovations 
difficulties or delays in the development  production or marketing of new services and information processing capabilities may be experienced  and may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
these difficulties and delays could also prevent the company from realizing a reasonable return on th e investment required to bring new services and information processing capabilities to market on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s operations could be disrupted if its information systems fail  causing increased expenses and loss of sales 
the company s business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its systems and communications capabilities  including the maintenance of customer databases for billing and label processing  and the company s magazine distribution order regulation system 
if a key system were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason  even if only for a short period  the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
the company s systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar event 
the company has a formal disaster recovery plan in place  but this plan may not entirely prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure 
the company s business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate the company for losses that may occur 
the company depends on the internet to deliver some services  which may expose the company to various risks 
many of the company s operations and services  including order taking on behalf of customers and communications with customers and suppliers  involve the use of the internet 
the company is therefore subject to factors that adversely affect internet usage  including the reliability of internet service providers that  from time to time may have operational problems and experience service outages 
additionally  as the company continues to increase the services it provides using the internet  the company is increasingly subject to risks related to the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches of the company s networks or those of its customers  or a secur ity breach affecting the internet in general  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive rules and regulations of credit card associations 
the company processes a large number of credit card transactions on behalf of its subscription fulfillment services customers and is thus subject to the extensive rules and regulations of the leading credit card associations 
the card associations modify their rules and regulations from time to time  and the company s inability to anticipate changes in such rules and regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof may result in substantial disruption to its business 
in the event that the card associations or the sponsoring banks determine that the manner in which the company processes certain card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations  or if the card associations adopt new rules or re gulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which the company processes card transactions  the company may be subject to substantial penalties and fines and be forced to modify the manner in which it operates  which may increase costs  or to cease processing certain types of transactions altogether  any of which could have a negative impact on its business 
other business risks the company s subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations and banking facilities 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the industries in which the company operates and the economy 
amrep southwest finances its operations in part through a loan agreement which matures in december as of april   the outstanding principal of this loan was  amrep southwest will be initiating discussions with the bank regarding renewal of this arrangement 
however  there can be no assurance that this facility can be renewed on acceptable terms 
if amrep southwest is not able to renew this fac ility on acceptable terms  or refinance it with another lender  the company would be forced to seek additional funds by selling assets or issuing equity  which it may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  the company s kable media services business now finances its operations in part through a revolving credit facility which replaced a predecessor revolving credit facility in may as of april   no loans were outstanding under the predecessor revolving credit facility 
the company s kable media services business also relies on cash flow from operations to fund its working capital requirements  including cash flow made available to it through arrangements with customers and wholesalers that are subject to expiration and renegotiation from time to time 
if amrep southwest does not renew or refinance its loan agreement or certain of kable media services arrangements with customers and wholesalers were terminated or modified to reduce or eliminate the source of working capital funding  it would likely have a material adverse affect on the company s overall liquidity 
the company may engage in future acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses  and  therefore  may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions in the time frames anticipated  or at all 
from time to time  the company may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions intended to complement or expand one or more of its business segments  such as the acquisition of palm coast data holdco  inc in january  or to enable the company to enter a new business 
the success of these transactions will depend in part on the company s ability to integrate the systems and personnel acquired in these transactions into its existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
the company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the company s operations or in separately managing a new business 
furthermore  the company may not realize the degree of benefits that the company anticipates when first entering into a transaction  or the company may realize benefits more slowly than it anticipates 
any of these problems or delays could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s current management and internal systems may not be adequate to handle the company s growth  if any 
to manage the company s future growth  if any  the company s management must continue to improve operational and financial systems and to expand  train  retain and manage the company s employee base 
if the company grows  it will also likely need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and its ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
at the same time  the company will likely be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other parties 
if the company s management personnel  systems  procedures and controls are inadequate to support its operations  expansion could be slowed or halted and the opportunity to gain significant additional market share could be impaired or lost 
any inability of the company s management to manage the company s growth effectively may adversely affect its results of operations 
the company s business could be seriously harmed if the company s accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes 
although the company evaluates its internal controls over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures at the end of each quarter  any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system will be met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s internal control systems and procedures  or the integration of its subscription fulfillment services businesses into one location in florida or any other future acquisitions and their respective internal control systems and procedures  will not result in or lead to a future material weakness in the company s internal controls  or that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the company s internal controls in the future 
if the company s internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  the company s financial statements could become incorrect or misleading and the company may experience a loss of public confidence  which could subject the company to liability and have an adverse effect on the company s business and the price of the company s common stock 
further  deficiencies or weaknesses that are not yet identified by the company could emerge and the identification and correction of those deficiencies or weaknesses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s pension plan  which the company froze in  is currently underfunded and will require additional cash contributions 
the company s pension plan was underfunded on a generally accepted accounting principles basis by approximately million at april  the company froze the pension plan effective march  so that from that date there would be no new participants in the plan and the existing participants future compensation would not affect their pension benefits 
a key assumption underlying the actuarial calculations upon which the company s accounting and reporting obligations for the pension plan are based is an assumed annual investment rate of return of eight percent 
if the pension plan assets do not realize the expected rate of return  or if any other assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations are incorrect or are modified  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plan beyond current requirements  which could impact the company s financial resources 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results can fluctuate significantly 
the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results  which may adversely affect the company s stock price 
future quarterly and annual operating results may not align with past trends as a result of numerous factors  including many factors that result from the unpredictability of the nature and timing of real estate land sales  the variability in gross profit margins and competitive pressures 
changes in the company s income tax estimates could affect profitability 
in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate the company s income taxes 
the company s estimates are based on its interpretation of federal and state tax laws and regulations 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent a djustments are required in any given period  the company will include the adjustments in the tax provision in its financial statements 
these adjustments could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the price of the company s common stock in recent years has been volatile 
this volatility may make it difficult for shareholders to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
the market price for the company s common stock varied between a high of and a low of per share during the two fiscal years ended april  this volatility may make it difficult for a shareholder to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
the company s stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other factors discussed in risk factors  and variations in the company s quarterly and annual operating results  which could be significant  material announcements by the company or the company s competitors  sales of a substantial number of shares of the company s common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s common stock is relatively thinly traded  which means that large transactions in the company s common stock may be difficult to conduct in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
the average trading volume in the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange over the ten day trading period ending on april  was approximately  shares per day 
further  there have been  from time to time  significant short positions in the company s common stock  consisting of borrowed shares sold  or shares sold for future delivery  which may not have been borrowed 
any attempt by the short sellers to liquidate their positions over a short period of time could cause signifi cant volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
the company has not been involved in any securities class action litigation  however  if the company were to become involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of the company s management s attention and resources and could harm the company s stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their ope rating performance and may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
the company has a principal shareholder whose interests may conflict with other investors 
the company has a principal shareholder  nicholas g 
karabots  who  together with certain of his affiliates  currently owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  this principal shareholder exercises significant influence over the company s major decisions  including through his ability to vote for the members of the company s board of directors 
because of this voting power  the principal shareholder could influence the company to make decisions that might run counter to the wishes of the company s other shareholders generally 
in addition  publishing companies owned or controlled by the company s principal shareholder are also significant customers of the company s newsstand distribution services business  as well as customers of its subscription fulfil lment services business  and  as a result  the shareholder may have business interests with respect to the company that differ from or conflict with those of other holders of the company s common stock 
although the company has paid dividends in the past  no dividends have been paid since  the company has no regular dividend policy and offers no assurance of any future dividends 
the company paid no cash dividends on its common stock in or although the company paid special cash dividends on its common stock during the five fiscal years through the board of directors has stated that it may consider special dividends from time to time in the future in light of conditions then existing  including earnings  financial condition  cash position  and capital requirements and other needs 
notwithstanding such statement and the status of such future conditions  no assurance is given that there will be any such future dividends declared or that future dividend declarations  if any  will be commensurate in amount or frequency with past dividends 
the company is currently a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules 
as a result  the company is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements and will not need to fully comply with those requirements until one year after the company is no longer a controlled company 
because nicholas g 
karabots and certain of his affiliates together currently own more than of the voting power of the company s common stock  the company is considered a controlled company for the purposes of the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange 
as such  the company is permitted  and has elected  to opt out of the new york stock exchange requirements that would otherwise require its compensation and human resources committee to consist entirely of independent directors 
the company has also opted not to have a nominating corporate governance committee as required by the new york stock exchange for non controlled companies 
at such time  if any  as the company is no longer considered a controlled company for purposes of the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange  those rules and regulations provide for a twelve month transition period during which the company will not need to fully comply with the otherwise applicable requirements 
the company will not be required to have entirely independent compensation and human resources and nominating corporate governance committees until twelve months following the date on which it ceases to be a controlled company  although the company will need to phase in independent members for each of these committees starting on the date that it ceases to be a controlled company 
while the company remains a controlled company and during any transition period following the company s ceasing to be a controlled company  shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements 
the presence of a controlling shareholder of the company  as well as certain provisions of oklahoma law and the company s organic documents  may impede or discourage a takeover  which may have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the concurrence of the company s majority controlling shareholder is needed for any third party to acquire control of the company  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the company s other shareholders 
furthermore  the company is an oklahoma corporation and even in the absence of a controlling shareholder  the anti takeover provisions of the company s amended certificate of incorporation and of oklahoma law generally prohibit the company from engaging in business combinations with an interested shareholder  as those terms are defined therein  unless the holders of at least two thirds of the company s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction 
in addition to this restriction  some other provisions of the company s amended certificate of incorporation and of its by laws may discourage certain acts involving a fundamental change of the company 
for example  the company s amended certificate of incorporation and its by laws contain certain provisions that classify the company s board of directors into three classes  each of which serves for a term of three years  with one class being elected each year  and prohibit shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders 
because the company s board of directors is classified and the company s amended certificate of incorporation and by laws do not otherwise provide  section of the oklahoma general corporation act permits the removal of any member of the board of directors only for cause 
these factors could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the company s common stock  which could have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock

data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and  unless otherwise qualified 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting returns of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of cos ts to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill impairment and assets held for sale  v actuarially determined benefit obligations for pension plan accounting  vi risk assessment of certain uncertain tax positions  and vii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers  which are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance w ith prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission r evenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill  which is based on the fair value of reporting units are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  v benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
as of april   the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and the effect of every change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year s pension cost by approximately  vi the company assesses risk for certain uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the positi on will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities  and vii the company is currently involved in legal proceedings which are described in item of this annual report on form k 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
results of operations year ended april  compared to year ended april  for  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share 
the results for included a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of   after tax  or per share  reflecting the write down of a real estate asset in colorado 
the results for included a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of   after tax  or per share  reflecting the write off of all of the goodwill of the company s subscription fulfillment services segment  and in addition included a write off of   after tax  or per share in respect of a receivable from a major magazine wholesaler which closed its business during revenues for were  compared to  in the prior year 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in amrep southwest has continued to experience substantially lower land sales in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico than it has historically experienced due to the prolonged severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas 
total acres sold were in and in the trend of declining permits for new home construction in the rio rancho area also continued  with fewer single family residential building permits issued during than in the company believes that this decline in new home construction reflected the persistenly weak national and local new mexico economies due to high unemployment levels  low consumer confidence  reduced credit availability and weak consumer spending  among other factors 
faced with these adverse conditions  many builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
these factors have also contributed to a steep decline in the company s sale of undeveloped land to both builders and investors 
in rio rancho  the company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national  regional and local home builders  commercial and industrial property developers and others 
the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho was  per acre in and  per acre in  reflecting differences in the mix of the types of properties sold relative to the total acreage in each period 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales was for compared to for the decrease in gross profit margin for was primarily attributable to one sale of approximately acres of undeveloped land that contributed a gross profit of  
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  amrep southwest recorded an impairment charge for  related to real estate property held in colorado 
the adjustment was required due to a current appraisal that showed a significant deterioration in the fair market value of the property from a year ago 
revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers  who are the principal customers of the company s media services operations  continued to suffer from reduced advertising revenues and lower subscription and newsstand sales during both periods  which caused some publishers to close magazine titles or seek more favorable terms from media services as well as its competitors 
revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  primarily reflecting i customer losses and ii reduced and lost business that resulted from lower publisher customer volumes and a higher attrition of magazine titles than has been previously experienced 
revenu es from newsstand distribution services increased from  for to  in with the increase due primarily to changes in product mix and some magazine cover prices increases 
revenues from product services and other increased from  for to  for  primarily from the full year inclusion of a product repackaging business and a temporary staffing business that were acquired in  whereas in the results of these businesses were included only from the date of their asset purchases in november media services operating expenses decreased by  for compared to  primarily attributable to a  reduction in wages and benefits associated with the revenue declines as well as from efficiencies resulting from a major project to consolidate the subscription fulfillment services business which is discussed more fully below  partly offset by increased costs associated with the consolidation project  including the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain assets totaling  and the effect of the  write off in respect of an uncollectible account receivable from the major newsstand distribution wholesaler in mentioned above with no similar event occurring in although there are multiple revenue streams in the subscription fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not normally provide ancillary services to a customer unless it was also providing the core service of maintaining a database of subscriber names 
thus  variations in subscription fulfillment services revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only on e primary service provided  which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three much larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one larger company in the subscription fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitive industry that limits the company s ability to increase its prices 
in october  the company announced a project to consolidate its subscription fulfillment services business operations from three locations in colorado  florida and illinois into one existing location at palm coast  florida  which is expected to streamline operations  improve service to clients and create cost efficiencies through reduced overhead costs and the elimination of operating redundancies 
this project is expected to be completed by october  as of april   the company had incurred approximately  for capital expenditures and  of non recurring costs related to the consolidation project 
the state of florida and the city of palm coast agreed to provide incentives for the project  including cash and employee training grants and tax relief  which are largely c ontingent on job retention  job creation and capital investment 
the company recognized  and  of income for and for certain incentives related to the consolidation project  which was netted against restructuring costs of  and  for the same periods 
as a result  the company reported net charges to operations of  and  related to the consolidation project for and the items of income for incentives and of costs related to the consolidation project are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
as of april  and  the company had accruals for future payments related to the consolidation project of  and  principally for severance and facilities consolidation 
cash payments related to the project were  and  for and there were no significant accrual reversals in any year related to the consolidation project 
the company anticipates approximately  of additional costs  primarely for severance  in related to the consolidation project 
in june  the company received  pursuant to an agreement with the state of florida the award agreement as part of the incentives made available to the company in connection with the consolidation project 
the award agreement requires the company to achieve certain objectives in terms of job retention  job creation and capital investment through december   if the objectives are not met  the company may need to return a portion  or all  of the  accordingly  the  has been recorded as a long term liability until the company is irrevocably entitled to retain the award  at which time the award will be amortized into income over the life of the assets acquired with the grant monies received 
in december  a warehouse leased by a kable subsidiary in oregon  illinois and its contents were totally destroyed by fire 
the warehouse was used principally to store back issues of magazines published by certain customers for whom the company filled back issue orders as part of its services 
the company was required to provide insurance for that property of certain of those customers 
through april   the company s insurance carrier had paid  to customers for lost materials 
the company has filed various claims with its insurance provider related to the fire 
as of april   the company had been reimbursed a total of  for property lost in the fire  other expenses of relocation and professional fees 
as a result of insurance reimbursements received  the company recorded net gains totaling  for and  for the items of income and expense related to insurance proceeds and the fire recovery costs are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
in addition  the company recorded other income for business interruption claims resulting from the fire that totaled  for and  for these income amounts are included in media services operations revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
interest and other revenues decreased  for compared to  primarily due to lower cash balances to invest 
other operating expenses increased  for compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense resulting from increased property tax valuations at amrep southwest 
general and administrative expenses of media services operations decreased  in compared to  primarily due to increased efficiencies resulting from the subscription fulfillment services business consolidation project 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase from the statutory rate in was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations 
the decrease from the statutory rate in was primarily due to permanent items  the most significant being the charge against book income associated with non amortizable goodwill 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  the company recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of   after tax  or per share 
this impairment charge reflected the write off of all of the goodwill of the company s subscription fulfillment services segment 
after giving effect to this impairment charge  the company had a net loss of  or per share  for fiscal compared to net income of  or per share  in revenues for were  compared to  in the prior year 
results for were entirely from continuing operations  including the impairment charge  while s results included a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  that reflected costs incurred in connection with the settlement of all litigation related to the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary that were in addition to costs that had been accrued for this matter in excluding the impairment charge  the net loss from continuing operations in was  or per share 
this included the fourth quarter write off in respect of a  receivable from a major magazine wholesaler which recently closed its business  after tax  or per share 
the primary reason for the fourth quarter non cash goodwill impairment charge was the lower than expected fiscal revenues and operating results of the company s subscription fulfillment services segment and a change in the company s internally projected future cash flows from that segment based on current industry trends 
these reduced results and expectations reflected the well publicized decline in the magazine publishing industry during fiscal  which represents the subscription fulfillment services segment s principal customer base  as well as the deep recession that has impacted the entire us economy and consumers and continuing economic uncertainty 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in  as amrep southwest experienced substantially lower land sales in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico due to the severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas 
total acres sold were in and in the trend of declining permits for new home construction in the rio rancho area also continued  with fewer single family residential building permits issued during than in the company believes that this decline in new home construction was consistent with and the result of the prolonged weakening of the national economy due to high unemployment levels  the deterioration of consumer confidence and the reducti on in credit availability and consumer spending 
faced with these adverse conditions  builders slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
these factors also contributed to a steep decline in the sale of undeveloped land to both builders and investors 
the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho was  per acre in and  per acre in  reflecting differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period 
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers  who are the principal customers of the company s media services operations  suffered generally from lower advertising revenues and lower subscription and newsstand sales during both periods  which led to reduced business for the company s media services operations 
revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  primarily reflecting the net effect of reduced and lost business that resulted from lower publisher customer volumes and higher attrition of magazine titles than had been previously experienced  offset in part by revenue gains from new and some existing clients

industry segment information is prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions

on an annual basis  management evaluates the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation

impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in any of its businesses
