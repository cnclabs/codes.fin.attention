for software delivered electronically  delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software based on the us eastern time zone time stamp 
the company also offers proprietary and third party services to its customers 
proprietary services generally include consulting  installation  integration  training  and maintenance 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized evenly over the coverage period of the underlying agreement 
many of the company s software arrangements include consulting services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
when the arrangements qualify as service transactions  consulting revenues from these arrangements are accounted for separately from the software revenues 
the significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should 
table of contents be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments  and the impact of milestones or other customer acceptance criteria on revenue realization 
if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for consulting services  the revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
for certain long term proprietary service contracts with fixed or not to exceed fee arrangements  the company estimates proportional performance using the hours incurred as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project consistent with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accordingly  revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the proportion of the work performed on the contract 
if there is no sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  the revenues are recognized when final customer acceptance is received 
adjustments to contract price and estimated service hours are made periodically  and losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
the aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs is shown as a current asset 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software and consulting services  then the software revenues are recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting 
contract accounting is applied to arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect the collection of revenues  significant modification or customization of the software  or provisions that tie the payment for the software to the performance of consulting services 
in addition to proprietary services  the company offers third party service contracts to its customers 
in such instances  the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the company bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer 
since the company is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions  the company reports revenue only in the amount of the commission equal to the selling price less the cost of sale received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk  as well as historical trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  net of related reserves 
the cost of inventory is computed using a weighted average method 
the company s inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is expensed in the period such determination is made to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
the company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions  defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
no tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold 
on april   the company recorded an additional liability of approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders equity for the fiscal year ended march  the company s income taxes are described further in note to consolidated financial statements titled  income taxes 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
goodwill is also subject to testing as necessary  if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of certain events indicate potential impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  identified intangibles  and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
the fair value of goodwill and long lived assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model and observed earnings and revenue trading multiples of identified peer companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
restructuring charges 
the company recognizes restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of the company s business  or the manner in which that business is conducted  is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties  and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable 
the company s restructuring reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities that will no longer be used in continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the asset impairments is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a credit adjusted risk free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
valuation of accounts payable 
the company s accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed by vendors for amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the company and confirmation of the claim by our vendors 
historically  the company s estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by vendors 
supplier programs 
the company receives funds from suppliers for product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
share based compensation 
the company has a stock incentive plan under which it may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  time vested restricted shares  restricted share units  performance vested restricted shares  and performance shares 
shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares 
the company also has an employee stock purchase plan 
the company records compensation expense related to stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  and performance shares granted to certain employees and non employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
the fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of the company s common shares on the grant date 
the fair value of stock option and stock settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the black sholes merton option pricing model  which includes assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  dividend yield  life of the award  and the volatility of the company s common shares 
additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share based compensation awards is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements titled  share based compensation
