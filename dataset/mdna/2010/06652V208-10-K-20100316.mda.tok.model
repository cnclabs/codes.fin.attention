recent developments regulatory actions in light of the current challenging operating environment  along with our elevated level of non performing assets  delinquencies  and adversely classified assets and our recent operating results  we expect banner bank to shortly enter into a memorandum of understanding or mou with the fdic and washington dfi 
we expect that  under the mou  banner bank will be required  among other things  to develop and implement plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to improve asset quality and reduce classified assets  to improve profitability  and to increase tier leverage capital to equal or exceed of average assets 
in addition  we expect that banner bank will not be able to pay cash dividends to banner corporation without prior approval from the fdic and washington dfi 
see item a  risk factors we are subject to various regulatory requirements  expect to be subject to a memorandum of understanding and may be subject to future additional regulatory restrictions and enforcement actions 
we also expect that the company will enter into a similar mou with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
in addition  the company and banner bank must obtain prior regulatory approval before adding any new director or senior executive officer or changing the responsibilities of any current senior executive officer 
further  the company may not pay any dividends on common or preferred stock  pay interest or principal on the balance of its junior subordinated debentures or repurchase our common stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve bank 
fdic prepayment on november   the fdic adopted a final rule that required insured depository institutions to prepay an estimate of their expected quarterly deposit insurance premiums for the fourth quarter of and for the three years ended december   and insured institutions were required to deposit funds with the fdic in the amount of the prepaid assessment on december  the insured institutions will not receive interest on the deposited funds 
for purposes of calculating an institution s prepaid assessment amount  for the fourth quarter of and all of  that institution s assessment rate was its total base assessment rate in effect on september  that rate was then increased by three basis points for all of and again  for purposes of calculating the prepaid amount  an institution s third quarter assessment base was assumed to increase quarterly by an estimated five percent annual growth rate through the end of each institution was directed to record the entire amount of its prepaid assessment as a prepaid expense asset 
thereafter  each institution will record an expense charge to earnings for its regular quarterly assessment for the quarter and an offsetting credit to the prepaid assessment until the asset is exhausted 
once the asset is exhausted  the institution will record an expense and an accrued expense payable each quarter for its regular assessment  which would be paid in arrears to the fdic at the end of the following quarter 
if the prepaid assessment is not exhausted by june   any remaining amount will be returned to the institution 
for banner corporation  the balance of this prepaid assessment was million at december  fdic special assessment on may   the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s total assets minus tier capital as of june   with the maximum amount of the special assessment for any institution not to exceed ten basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter risk based assessment 
the special assessment was collected on september  at the same time the regular quarterly risk based assessment for the second quarter of was collected 
for banner corporation  this assessment was million  which was recognized in other operating expenses during the quarter ended june  the fdic board may vote to impose additional special assessments if the fdic estimates that the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio will fall to a level that the board believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level that will be close to or below zero 
fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have chosen to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp  which applies to all us depository institutions insured by the fdic and all united states bank holding companies  unless they have opted out 
under the tlgp  the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of insured institutions and their holding companies  as well as non interest bearing transaction account deposits 
under the transaction account guarantee component of the tlgp  all non interest bearing and certain interest bearing transaction accounts maintained at banner bank and islanders bank are insured in full by the fdic until june   regardless of the standard maximum deposit insurance amounts 
the banks are required to pay a fee annualized on balances of each covered account in excess of  while the extra deposit insurance is in place 
the annualized fee for the transaction account guarantee program is basis points through december  and will be within a range from to basis points from january through june  further  on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes covered by the tlgp at a fixed rate of which mature on march  under the debt guarantee component of the tlgp  the fdic will pay the unpaid principal and interest on these senior notes upon the uncured failure of banner bank to make a timely payment of principal or interest 
under the terms of the tlgp  banner bank was not permitted to use the proceeds from the sale of securities guaranteed under the tlgp to prepay any of its other debt that is not guaranteed by the fdic 
banner bank is required to pay a fee annualized on this debt  which will result in a total fee of million over three years 
none of the senior notes are redeemable prior to maturity 
participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program on november   we received million from the us treasury department as part of the treasury s capital purchase program

the additional capital enhances our capacity to support the communities we serve through expanded lending activities and economic development 
this capital also adds flexibility in considering strategic opportunities that may be available to us 
goodwill write off as a result of the significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization over the course of and in conjunction with similar declines in the value of most financial institutions and the ongoing disruption in related financial markets  we decided to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in our consolidated statements of financial condition by recording a million write down in the second quarter and  in response to worsening economic indicators and further price declines  an additional million write down in the fourth quarter of the total million write off of goodwill was a non cash charge that did not affect the company s or the banks liquidity or operations 
the adjustment brought our book value and tangible book value more closely in line with each other and more accurately reflected current market conditions 
also  since goodwill is excluded from regulatory capital  the impairment charge which was not deductible for tax purposes did not have an adverse effect on the regulatory capital ratios of the company or either of our subsidiary banks  each of which continues to remain well capitalized under the regulatory requirements 
see note of the selected notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to our valuation of intangible assets 
lending activities general all of our lending activities are conducted through banner bank  its subsidiary  community financial corporation  and islanders bank 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers 
we originate loans for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
management s strategy has been to maintain a well diversified portfolio with a significant percentage of assets in the loan portfolio having more frequent interest rate repricing terms or shorter maturities than traditional long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
as part of this effort  we have developed a variety of floating or adjustable interest rate products that correlate more closely with our cost of funds  particularly loans for commercial business and real estate  agricultural business  and construction and development purposes 
however  in response to customer demand  we continue to originate fixed rate loans  including fixed interest rate mortgage loans with terms of up to years 
the relative amount of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the past two years our origination of construction and land development loans has declined materially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has declined 
by contrast  for the year ended december   residential mortgage loan originations significantly increased  primarily reflecting the impact of exceptionally low interest rates on the demand for loans to refinance existing debt  although loans to finance home purchases also increased 
our real estate lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the recessionary economy  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been weak and total outstanding balances declined modestly compared to a year earlier 
we have also increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although demand for consumer loans also has been modest in recent quarters 
still  the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans has increased and as of december  was of total loans 
while continuing our commitment to residential lending  including our mortgage banking activities  we expect commercial lending including owner occupied commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural loans and consumer lending to become increasingly more important activities for us 
by contrast  we anticipate residential construction and related land development lending  which at december  represented of the loan portfolio  compared to a year earlier  will continue to be restrained by market conditions for the foreseeable future  as well as by our efforts to reduce our concentration in this type of lending  with balances continuing to decline for a number of quarters 
we also expect to curtail lending for non owner occupied investor commercial real estate and expect balances for this type of loan to decline for the foreseeable future 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion 
for additional information concerning our loan portfolio  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and loans lending 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio  and tables and a  which contain information regarding the loans maturing in our portfolio 
one to four family residential real estate lending at both banner bank and islanders bank  we originate loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences in the northwest communities where we have offices 
banner bank s mortgage lending subsidiary  cfc  provides residential lending primarily in the greater portland  oregon and pasco tri cities  washington market areas 
while we offer a wide range of products  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending  which we define as loans to borrowers with poor credit histories or undocumented repayment capabilities and with excessive reliance on the collateral as the source of repayment 
however  we have experienced a modest increase in delinquencies on our residential loans in response to the weakened housing market conditions 
at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgages arms at rates and terms competitive with market conditions  primarily with the intent of selling these loans into the secondary market 
fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from to years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing 
most arm products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to five years  subject to a limitation on the annual change of to and a lifetime limitation of to 
for a small portion of the portfolio  where the initial period exceeds one year  the first rate change may exceed the annual limitation on subsequent rate changes 
our arm products most frequently adjust based upon the average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year plus a margin or spread above the index 
arm loans held in our portfolio may allow for interest only payments for an initial period up to five years but do not provide for negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment restrictions 
the retention of arm loans in our loan portfolio can help reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  borrower demand for arm loans versus fixed rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates  the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan 
in recent years  borrower demand for arm loans has been limited and we have chosen not to aggressively pursue arm loans by offering minimally profitable  deeply discounted teaser rates or option payment arm products 
as a result  arm loans have represented only a small portion of our loans originated during this period and of our portfolio 
our residential loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or fhlmc and the federal national mortgage corporation fannie mae or fnma 
government insured loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the department of housing and urban development hud and the veterans administration va 
in the loan approval process  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the adequacy of the proposed security  the employment stability of the borrower and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
for arm loans  our standard practice provides for underwriting based upon fully indexed interest rates and payments 
generally  we will lend up to of the lesser of the appraised value of the property or purchase price of the property on conventional loans  although higher loan to value ratios are available on certain government insured programs 
we require private mortgage insurance on residential loans with a loan to value ratio at origination exceeding 
a growing number of exceptions to these general underwriting guidelines have been granted in connection with the sale or refinance of properties  particularly new construction  for which we were already providing financing 
these exceptions most commonly relate to loan to value and mortgage insurance requirements and not to credit underwriting or loan documentation standards 
such exceptions will likely continue in the near term to facilitate troubled loan resolution in the current distressed housing market  and may have performance characteristics different from the rest of our one to four family loan portfolio 
through our mortgage banking activities  we sell residential loans on either a servicing retained or servicing released basis 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
during the past three years  we have sold a significant portion of our conventional residential mortgage originations and nearly all of our government insured loans into the secondary market 
construction and land lending we have invested a significant portion of our loan portfolio in residential construction and land loans to professional home builders and developers 
to a lesser extent  we also originate construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
in years prior to  residential construction and land development lending was an area of major emphasis at banner bank and the primary focus of its subsidiary  cfc 
our largest concentration of construction and land development loans is in the portland vancouver market area 
we also have a significant amount of construction and land loans for properties in the puget sound region and to a much smaller extent in the greater boise area and certain eastern washington and eastern oregon markets 
at december   construction and land loans totaled million  or of total loans of the company  consisting of million of one to four family construction loans  million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans 
historically  prior to the last two years  construction and land lending afforded us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than are usually available on other types of lending 
construction and land lending  however  involve a higher degree of risk than other lending opportunities because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects 
loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan is dependent on the builder s ability to sell the property before the construction loan is due 
we address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies  disbursement procedures and monitoring practices 
construction loans made by us include those with a sale contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may be identified either during or following the construction period 
we actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations 
the maximum number of speculative loans approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors  including the financial capacity of the builder  the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains 
we have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic area with numerous sub markets 
loans for the construction of one to four family residences are generally made for a term of twelve to eighteen months 
our loan policies include maximum loan to value ratios of up to for speculative loans 
individual speculative loan requests are supported by an independent appraisal of the property  a set of plans  a cost breakdown and a completed specifications form 
underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength  credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations 
all speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers 
we also make land loans to developers  builders and individuals to finance the acquisition and or development of improved lots or unimproved land 
in making land loans  we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans 
the initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with interest only payments  payable monthly  and provisions for principal reduction as lots are sold and released from the lien of the mortgage 
we regularly monitor the construction and land loan portfolios and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and decrease this type of lending if we perceive unfavorable market conditions such as the existing economic environment 
housing markets in most areas of the pacific northwest have significantly deteriorated over the past two years and our origination of new construction loans has declined sharply as a result 
we believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place mitigate many of the risks inherent in construction and land lending  however  current weak housing market conditions have nonetheless resulted in a material increase of delinquencies and charge offs in our construction and land loan portfolios 
construction and land loans represent of our portfolio and are responsible for approximately of our non performing assets 
although well diversified with respect to sub markets  price ranges and borrowers  our construction and land loans are significantly concentrated in the greater puget sound region of washington state and the portland  oregon market area 
reducing the amount of non performing construction and land development loans is currently the most critical issue that we face and need to resolve to return to acceptable levels of profitability 
the most significant risk in this portfolio relates to the land development loans as demand for building lots is currently weak 
see asset quality below and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate including  as noted above  loans for construction of multifamily and commercial real estate projects 
commercial real estate loans are made for both owner occupied and investor properties 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans  including million in owner occupied commercial real estate loans and million in non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  which together comprised of our total loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate lending affords us an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
however  loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are generally greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  riskier than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in originating multifamily and commercial real estate loans  we consider the location  marketability and overall attractiveness of the properties 
our current underwriting guidelines for multifamily and commercial real estate loans require an appraisal from a qualified independent appraiser and an economic analysis of each property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses  debt service coverage and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount 
in the approval process we assess the borrowers willingness and ability to manage the property and repay the loan and the adequacy of the collateral in relation to the loan amount 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
most multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated in the past five years are linked to various us treasury indices  federal home loan bank advance rates  certain prime rates or other market rate indices 
rates on these adjustable rate loans generally adjust with a frequency of one to five years after an initial fixed rate period ranging from one to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no large concentrations by property type  location or borrower 
at december   the average size of our commercial real estate loans was  and the largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio was million 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending and are engaged to a lesser extent in agricultural lending primarily by providing crop production loans 
our officers devote a great deal of effort to developing customer relationships and the ability to serve these types of borrowers 
management believes that many larger banks have neglected these lending markets  which has contributed to our success 
while strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
management has leveraged the past success of these officers with local decision making ability to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped us increase our deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services is currently an area of significant focus by us and staffing has been increased in the areas of credit administration  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
commercial business loans may entail greater risk than other types of loans 
commercial business loans may be unsecured or secured by special purpose or rapidly depreciating assets  such as equipment  inventory and receivables  which may not provide an adequate source of repayment on defaulted loans 
in addition  commercial business loans are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength and management ability  as well as market conditions for various products  services and commodities 
for these reasons  commercial business loans generally provide higher yields than many other types of loans but also require more administrative and management attention 
loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
we underwrite our commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than on the basis of the underlying collateral value 
we seek to structure these loans so that they have more than one source of repayment 
the borrower is required to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to make a lending determination 
in most instances  this information consists of at least three years of financial statements  tax returns  a statement of projected cash flows  current financial information on any guarantor and information about the collateral 
loans to closely held businesses typically require personal guarantees by the principals 
our commercial loan portfolio is geographically dispersed across the market areas serviced by our branch network and there are no significant concentrations by industry or products 
our commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit 
commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of fixed assets and have maturities of five years or less 
commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year 
adjustable or floating rate loans are primarily tied to various prime rate and london inter bank offering rate or libor indices 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of our total loans 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many parts of our service areas 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operations of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile 
at december   agricultural business loans  including collateral secured loans to purchase farm land and equipment  totaled million  or of our loan portfolio 
agricultural operating loans generally are made as a percentage of the borrower s anticipated income to support budgeted operating expenses 
these loans are secured by a blanket lien on all crops  livestock  equipment  accounts and products and proceeds thereof 
in the case of crops  consideration is given to projected yields and prices from each commodity 
the interest rate is normally floating based on the prime rate plus a negotiated margin 
because these loans are made to finance a farm or ranch s annual operations  they are usually written on a one year review and renewable basis 
the renewal is dependent upon the prior year s performance and the forthcoming year s projections as well as the overall financial strength of the borrower 
we carefully monitor these loans and related variance reports on income and expenses compared to budget estimates 
to meet the seasonal operating needs of a farm  borrowers may qualify for single payment notes  revolving lines of credit and or non revolving lines of credit 
in underwriting agricultural operating loans  we consider the cash flow of the borrower based upon the expected operating results as well as the value of collateral used to secure the loans 
collateral generally consists of cash crops produced by the farm  such as milk  grains  fruit  grass seed  peas  sugar beets  mint  onions  potatoes  corn and alfalfa or livestock 
in addition to considering cash flow and obtaining a blanket security interest in the farm s cash crop  we may also collateralize an operating loan with the farm s operating equipment  breeding stock  real estate and federal agricultural program payments to the borrower 
we also originate loans to finance the purchase of farm equipment 
loans to purchase farm equipment are made for terms of up to seven years 
on occasion  we also originate agricultural real estate loans secured primarily by first liens on farmland and improvements thereon located in our market areas  although generally only to service the needs of our existing customers 
loans are written in amounts ranging from to of the tax assessed or appraised value of the property for terms of five to years 
these loans generally have interest rates that adjust at least every five years based upon a us treasury index or federal home loan bank advance rate plus a negotiated margin 
fixed rate loans are granted on terms usually not to exceed five years 
in originating agricultural real estate loans  we consider the debt service coverage of the borrower s cash flow  the appraised value of the underlying property  the experience and knowledge of the borrower  and the borrower s past performance with us and or the market area 
these loans normally are not made to start up businesses and are reserved for existing customers with substantial equity and a proven history 
among the more common risks to agricultural lending can be weather conditions and disease 
these risks may be mitigated through multi peril crop insurance 
commodity prices also present a risk  which may be reduced by the use of set price contracts 
normally  required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies 
in addition to these risks  we also consider management succession  life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural loans 
consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business  with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years and management anticipates increased activity in future periods 
part of this emphasis has been the reintroduction of a banner bank funded credit card program which we began marketing in the fourth quarter of similar to other consumer loan programs  we focus this credit card program on our existing customer base to add to the depth of our customer relationships 
as a result of increased marketing efforts  an improved retail delivery network and strong borrower demand  as well as the three bank acquisitions  our consumer loans increased significantly in the past two years 
our underwriting of consumer loans is focused on the borrower s credit history and ability to repay the debt as evidenced by documented sources of income 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer related loans 
similar to commercial loans  consumer loans often entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loans such as us  and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
loan solicitation and processing we originate real estate loans in our market areas by direct solicitation of real estate brokers  builders  depositors  walk in customers and visitors to our internet website 
loan applications are taken by our loan officers or through our internet website and are processed in branch or regional locations 
most underwriting and loan administration functions for our real estate loans are performed by loan personnel at central locations 
we do not make loans originated by independent third party loan brokers or any similar wholesale loan origination channels 
our commercial loan officers solicit commercial and agricultural business loans through call programs focused on local businesses and farmers 
while commercial loan officers are delegated reasonable commitment authority based upon their qualifications  credit decisions on significant commercial and agricultural loans are made by senior loan officers or in certain instances by the board of directors of banner bank  islanders bank or banner corporation 
we originate consumer loans through various marketing efforts directed primarily toward our existing deposit and loan customers 
consumer loan applications are primarily underwritten and documented by centralized administrative personnel 
loan originations  sales and purchases while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments  of million  million and million  respectively 
the level of originations  net of repayments  in the three most recent years has been less than in prior years primarily as a result of a decrease in the origination of new construction and land loans in response to slower new home sales 
we sell many of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
sales of loans generally are beneficial to us because these sales may generate income at the time of sale  provide funds for additional lending and other investments  increase liquidity or reduce interest rate risk 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
all loans are sold without recourse 
see loan servicing 
at december   we had million in loans held for sale 
we periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market area and at times to support our community reinvestment act lending activities 
any such purchases are made consistent with our underwriting standards  however  the loans may be located outside of our normal lending area 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
loan servicing we receive fees from a variety of institutional owners in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual payments and managing portfolios of sold loans 
at december   we were servicing million of loans for others 
loan servicing includes processing payments  accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related items such as private mortgage insurance 
in addition to earning fee income  we retain certain amounts in escrow for the benefit of the lender for which we incur no interest expense but are able to invest the funds into earning assets 
at december   we held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of loan servicing fees  which is net of million of servicing rights amortization and an  charge for a valuation adjustment to mortgage servicing rights  in our results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million million and  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was million   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by higher levels of current or anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december   our msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization 
asset quality classified assets state and federal regulations require that the banks review and classify their problem assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  state and federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
historically  we have not had any meaningful differences of opinion with the examiners with respect to asset classification 
banner bank s credit policy division reviews detailed information with respect to the composition and performance of the loan portfolios  including information on risk concentrations  delinquencies and classified assets for both banner bank and islanders bank 
the credit policy division approves all recommendations for new classified loans or  in the case of smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential real estate and consumer loans  it has approved policies governing such classifications  or changes in classifications  and develops and monitors action plans to resolve the problems associated with the assets 
the credit policy division also approves recommendations for establishing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
significant problem loans are transferred to banner bank s special assets department for resolution or collection activities 
the banks and banner corporation s boards of directors are given a detailed report on classified assets and asset quality at least quarterly 
for additional information with respect to asset quality and non performing loans  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality  and table contained therein 
allowance for loan losses in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with us generally acceptable accounting principles gaap guidelines 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible loan losses against our income 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of net loans and of non performing loans compared to and  respectively  at december  for additional information concerning our allowance for loan losses  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and provision and allowance for loan losses  and tables and contained therein 
investment activities under washington state law  banks are permitted to invest in various types of marketable securities 
authorized securities include but are not limited to us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies including government sponsored enterprises  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements  federal funds  commercial paper  corporate debt and equity securities and obligations of states and their political subdivisions 
our investment policies are designed to provide and maintain adequate liquidity and to generate favorable rates of return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk 
our policies generally limit investments to us government and government agency including government sponsored entities securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  corporate debt obligations and mortgage backed securities 
investment in mortgage backed securities may include those issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  government national mortgage association ginnie mae or gnma and privately issued mortgage backed securities that have an aa credit rating or higher at the time of purchase  as well as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
a high credit rating indicates only that the rating agency believes there is a low risk of loss or default 
to the best of our knowledge  we do not have any investments in mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles that have a material exposure to sub prime mortgages 
however  we do have investments in single issuer and pooled trust preferred securities that have been materially adversely impacted by concerns related to the banking and insurance industries as well as payment deferrals and defaults by certain issuers 
further  all of our investment securities  including those that have high credit ratings  are subject to market risk in so far as a change in market rates of interest or other conditions may cause a change in an investment s earning performance and or market value 
at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives  and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in loan originations  deposits and other activities 
during the year ended december   holdings of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million  us treasury and agency obligations increased million to million  corporate securities including equities decreased million largely as a result of fair value adjustments to million  and municipal bonds increased million to million 
for detailed information on our investment securities  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and investments  and tables to contained therein 
off balance sheet derivatives derivatives include off balance sheet financial products whose value is dependent on the value of an underlying financial asset  such as a stock  bond  foreign currency  or a reference rate or index 
such derivatives include forwards  futures  options or swaps 
we generally have not invested in off balance sheet derivative instruments  although investment policies authorize such investments 
however  through our acquisition of f m we became a party to approximately million million as of december  in notional amounts of interest rate swaps 
these swaps serve as hedges to an equal amount of fixed rate loans which include market value prepayment penalties that mirror the provision of the specifically matched interest rate swaps 
the fair value adjustments for these swaps and the related loans are reflected in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate  and in the carrying value of the hedged loans 
also  as a part of mortgage banking activities  we issue rate lock commitments to borrowers and obtain offsetting best efforts delivery commitments from purchasers of loans 
while not providing any trading or net settlement mechanisms  these off balance sheet commitments do have many of the prescribed characteristics of derivatives and as a result are accounted for as such 
accordingly  on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
on december   we had no other investment related off balance sheet derivatives 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general deposits  fhlb advances or other borrowings and loan repayments are our major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced by general economic  interest rate and money market conditions and may vary significantly 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes  including funding loans and investments 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our recent branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
in addition  our electronic banking activities including debit card and automated teller machine atm programs  online internet banking services and  most recently  customer remote deposit and mobile banking capabilities are all directed at providing products and services that enhance customer relationships and result in growing deposit balances 
growing deposits is a fundamental element of our core business strategy 
deposit accounts we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability to us  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits 
for additional information concerning our deposit accounts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and deposit accounts 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the balances of deposits in the various types of accounts  and table  which sets forth the amount of our certificates of deposit greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december  borrowings while deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we also use borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to more efficiently leverage our capital position 
the fhlb seattle serves as our primary borrowing source 
the fhlb seattle provides credit for member financial institutions such as banner bank and islanders bank 
as members  the banks are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of their mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle 
at that date  banner bank had been authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to billion under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement 
more recently  the federal reserve bank of san francisco frbsf has also served as an important source of borrowings 
the frbsf provides credit based upon acceptable loan collateral  which includes certain loan types not eligible for pledging to the fhlb seattle 
at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the frbsf  although at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
although eligible to participate  islanders bank has not applied for approval to borrow from the frbsf 
for additional information concerning our borrowings  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and borrowings  table contained therein  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we issue retail repurchase agreements  generally due within days  as an additional source of funds  primarily in connection with cash management services provided to our larger deposit customers 
at december   we had issued retail repurchase agreements totaling million  which were secured by a pledge of certain us agency notes and mortgage backed securities with a market value of million 
on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes that are guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
these notes require interest only payments for a term of three years with principal payable in full at maturity 
these notes provided supplemental funding which strengthened the liquidity position of the bank  however  going forward we do not anticipate any additional borrowings under the tlgp 
we also may borrow funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
however  we did not have any wholesale repurchase borrowings at december  in addition to our borrowings  we have also issued million of junior subordinated debentures in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities tps 
the tps were issued from through by special purpose business trusts formed by banner corporation and were sold in private offerings to pooled investment vehicles 
the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition  however  at december   all of the fair value of the debentures qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
we have invested a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the tps as additional paid in capital at banner bank 
for additional information about deposits and other sources of funds  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes   and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item personnel as of december   we had  full time and part time employees 
banner corporation has no employees except for those who are also employees of banner bank  its subsidiaries  and islanders bank 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
taxation federal taxation general for tax reporting purposes  we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting on a consolidated basis 
we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for additional information concerning the income taxes payable by us 
provisions of the small business job protection act of the job protection act significantly altered our tax bad debt deduction method and the circumstances that would require a tax bad debt reserve recapture 
prior to enactment of the job protection act  savings institutions banner bank was previously chartered as a savings institution were permitted to compute their tax bad debt deduction through use of either the reserve method or the percentage of taxable income method 
the job protection act repealed both of these methods for large savings institutions and allows bad debt deductions based only on actual current losses 
while repealing the reserve method for computing tax bad debt deductions  the job protection act allowed savings institutions to retain their existing base year bad debt reserves but required that reserves in excess of the balance at december   be recaptured into taxable income over six years 
the reserves in excess of the base year december  had been fully recaptured into taxable income as of december  the base year reserve is recaptured into taxable income only in limited situations  such as in the event of certain excess distributions  complete liquidation or disqualification as a bank 
none of the limited circumstances requiring recapture are contemplated by us 
the amount of our tax bad debt reserves subject to recapture in these circumstances was approximately million at december  as a result of the remote nature of events that may trigger the recapture provisions  no tax liability has been established in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
state taxation washington taxation we are subject to a business and occupation b o tax which is imposed under washington law at the rate of of gross receipts  however  interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties  residential mortgage backed securities  and certain us government and agency securities is not subject to such tax 
our b o tax expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oregon and idaho taxation corporations with nexus in the states of oregon and idaho are subject to a corporate level income tax 
our operations in those states resulted in corporate income taxes of approximately   and  net of federal tax benefit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as our operations in these states increase  the state income tax provision will have an increasing effect on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
competition we encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial and savings banks  savings associations and credit unions with offices in our market areas 
we also experience competition from securities firms  insurance companies  money market and mutual funds  and other investment vehicles 
we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future  including competition from on line internet banking competitors 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to provide transaction services and investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of depositors 
we compete for deposits by offering a variety of accounts and financial services  including robust electronic banking capabilities  with competitive rates and terms  at convenient locations and business hours  and delivered with a high level of personal service and expertise 
competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks  loan brokers  mortgage banking companies  savings banks and credit unions 
the competition for loans is intense as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas 
we compete for loans primarily by offering competitive rates and fees and providing timely decisions and excellent service to borrowers 
regulation banner bank and islanders bank general as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  banner bank and islanders bank the banks are subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements  including prescribed minimum capital standards 
the banks are regularly examined by the fdic and state banking regulators and file periodic reports concerning their activities and financial condition with these banking regulators 
the banks relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law  especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the banks  including reserves  loans  investments  deposits  capital  issuance of securities  payment of dividends and establishment of branches 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
under the expected mou  banner bank will not be able to pay cash dividends to banner corporation without the prior approval of the washington dfi and the fdic 
the respective primary federal regulators of banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
state regulation and supervision as a washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  banner bank is subject to the applicable provisions of washington  oregon and idaho law and regulations 
state law and regulations govern banner bank s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon  to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate  to make consumer loans  to invest in securities  to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices 
in a similar fashion  washington state laws and regulations for state chartered commercial banks also apply to islanders bank 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits  up to applicable limits  of depository institutions 
as insurer of the banks deposits  the fdic has supervisory and enforcement authority over banner bank and islanders bank 
the deposits of the banks are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  or dif  which is administered by the fdic 
the fdic insures deposits up to the applicable limits and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the fdic 
it also may prohibit any institution insured by the fdic from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the dif 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on all fdic insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories 
each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital  supervisory ratings and other factors 
well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to risk category i 
risk categories ii  iii and iv present progressively greater risks to the dif 
under the fdic s risk based assessment rules  effective april   the initial base assessment rates prior to adjustments range from to basis points for risk category i  and are basis points for risk category ii  basis points for risk category iii  and basis points for risk category iv 
initial base assessment rates are subject to adjustments based on an institution s unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits  such that the total base assessment rates after adjustments range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv 
rates increase uniformly by three basis points effective january  in addition to the regular quarterly assessments  due to losses and projected losses attributed to failed institutions  the fdic imposed on every insured institution a special assessment of five basis points on the amount of each depository institution s assets reduced by the amount of its tier capital not to exceed basis points of its assessment base for regularly quarterly premiums as of june   which was collected on september  as a result of a decline in the reserve ratio the ratio of the dif to estimated insured deposits and concerns about expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the dif  the fdic adopted a rule requiring each insured institution to prepay on december  the estimated amount of its quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of and all quarters through the end of in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter which was due on december  
the prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance 
for purposes of calculating the prepaid amount  assessments were measured at the institution s assessment rate as of september   with a uniform increase of basis points effective january   and were based on the institution s assessment base for the third quarter of  with growth assumed quarterly at annual rate of 
if events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount  institutions will pay excess assessments in cash or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on june   as applicable 
collection of the prepayment does not preclude the fdic from changing assessment rates or revising the risk based assessment system in the future 
the rule includes a process for exemption from the prepayment for institutions whose safety and soundness would be affected adversely 
we prepaid million in fdic assessments during the fourth quarter of and the balance of the prepaid assessment was million at december  the fdic estimates that the reserve ratio the ratio of the net worth of the dif to estimated insured deposits will reach the designated reserve ratio of by as required by statute 
federally insured institutions are required to pay a financing corporation assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the s 
for the quarterly period ended december   the financing corporation assessment equaled basis points for each in domestic deposits 
these assessments  which may be revised based upon the level of dif deposits  will continue until the bonds mature in the years through for  the banks incurred  in fico assessments 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of either banner bank or islanders bank 
prompt corrective action federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a core capital to risk weighted assets ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements  regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized 
failure by either banner bank and islanders bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would  if unremedied  result in progressively more severe restrictions on their respective activities and lead to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and  ultimately  the appointment of the fdic as receiver or conservator 
banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
additionally  approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements 
at december   both banner bank and islanders bank were categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the fdic 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed  by regulation  guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical  and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities 
the information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer  and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information 
each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems 
if the fdic determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines  it may require an institution to submit to the fdic an acceptable plan to achieve compliance 
capital requirements federally insured financial institutions  such as banner bank and islanders bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core tier capital and supplementary tier capital 
tier capital generally includes common stockholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less most intangible assets 
tier capital  which is recognized up to of tier capital for risk based capital purposes after any deductions for disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets  includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  long term preferred stock  certain perpetual preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments including mandatory convertible debt  term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock original average maturity of at least five years  and net unrealized holding gains on equity securities subject to certain limitations  provided  however  the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may in included in tier capital for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital 
the fdic currently measures an institution s capital using a leverage limit together with certain risk based ratios 
the fdic s minimum leverage capital requirement specifies a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets 
most banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least to of total assets 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier leverage capital ratios of and  respectively 
the fdic retains the right to require a particular institution to maintain a higher capital level based on an institution s particular risk profile 
under the expected mou  we anticipate that we will be required to maintain banner bank s leverage ratio at within a certain prescribed time period 
fdic regulations also establish a measure of capital adequacy based on ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of the category 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts  and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories 
under the guidelines  the ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least  and the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least 
in evaluating the adequacy of a bank s capital  the fdic may also consider other factors that may affect the bank s financial condition 
such factors may include interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentration of credit risk  risks arising from nontraditional activities  loan and investment quality  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s ability to monitor and control financial operating risks 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
fdic capital requirements are designated as the minimum acceptable standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound  which are well managed and have no material or significant financial weaknesses 
the fdic capital regulations state that  where the fdic determines that the financial history or condition  including off balance sheet risk  managerial resources and or the future earnings prospects of a bank are not adequate and or a bank has a significant volume of assets classified substandard  doubtful or loss or otherwise criticized  the fdic may determine that the minimum adequate amount of capital for the bank is greater than the minimum standards established in the regulation 
we believe that  under the current regulations  banner bank and islanders bank exceed their minimum capital requirements 
however  events beyond the control of the banks  such as weak or depressed economic conditions in areas where they have most of their loans  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the banks to meet their capital requirements

emergency economic stabilization act of in october  the eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorizes the us treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
under the tarp capital purchase program  or cpp  the treasury may purchase debt or equity securities from participating institutions 
the tarp also allows direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions 
participants in the cpp are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications 
banner completed its tarp cpp transaction on november  and received million in funding from the us treasury department 
for additional information regarding the tarp cpp transaction  see risk factors risks related to our business risks specific to our participation in tarp 
eesa also included additional provisions directed at bolstering the economy  which we were able to participate in  such as the temporary increase in fdic insurance coverage of deposit accounts  which increased from  to  through december  temporary liquidity guaranty program following a systemic risk determination  the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  on october  under the interim rule for the tlgp  there are two parts to the program the debt guarantee program  or the dgp  and the transaction account guarantee program  or the tagp 
eligible entities generally are participants unless they exercised opt out rights in timely fashion 
banner bank and islanders bank did not opt out of these programs 
for the dgp  eligible entities are generally us bank holding companies  savings and loan holding companies  and fdic insured institutions 
under the dgp  the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of an eligible entity that are issued not later than october  the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  for debt issued before april  or december  for debt issued on or after april  
the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june   or for certain institutions  of liabilities as of september  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized  depending on maturity  for covered debt outstanding during the period until the earlier of maturity or june   with various surcharges of to basis points applicable to debt with a maturity of one year or more issued on or after april  generally  eligible debt of a participating entity becomes covered when and as issued until the coverage limit is reached  except that under some circumstances  participating entities can issue certain nonguaranteed debt 
various features of the dgp require applications  additional fees  and approvals 
on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes that are guaranteed by the fdic under the dgp 
these notes require interest only payments for a term of three years with principal payable in full at maturity 
banner bank is required to pay a fee annualized on this debt  which will result in a total fee of million over three years 
none of the senior notes are redeemable prior to maturity 
we do not anticipate any additional borrowing under the tlgp 
for the tagp  eligible entities are fdic insured institutions 
under the tagp  the fdic provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts  now accounts bearing interest at or less  and certain funds swept into non interest bearing savings accounts 
other now accounts and money market deposit accounts are not covered 
tagp coverage lasts until december  and  unless the participant has opted out of the extension period  during the extension period of january  through june  participating institutions pay fees of basis points annualized on the balance of each covered account in excess of  during the period through december  during the extension period  such fees are basis points for institutions in risk category i  basis points for those in risk category ii and basis points for those in risk categories iii and iv risk categories are those assigned for deposit insurance purposes 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra into law 
the arra is intended to revive the us economy by creating millions of new jobs and stemming home foreclosures 
for financial institutions that have received or will receive financial assistance under tarp or related programs  the arra significantly rewrites the original executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of section of the eesa 
among the most important changes instituted by the arra are new limits on the ability of tarp recipients to pay incentive compensation to up to of the next most highly compensated employees in addition to the senior executive officers  a restriction on termination of employment payments to senior executive officers and the five next most highly compensated employees and a requirement that tarp recipients implement say on pay shareholder votes

real estate lending standards the federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution 
the purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations 
the guidance directs the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk 
a bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan  or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent or more of the bank s capital  or total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance represent or more of the bank s total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
the guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy 
as of december   banner bank s and islanders bank s aggregate loans in excess of the supervisory concentration ratios for construction  land development and land loans were and of total capital 
in addition  at december   banner bank s and islanders bank s loans on commercial real estate were and  respectively  of total capital 
as part of the expected mou  banner bank will be required to develop and implement a plan to reduce its commercial real estate concentration 
activities and investments of insured state chartered financial institutions federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of fdic insured  state chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks 
an insured state bank is not prohibited from  among other things  acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary  investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition  rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project  provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed of the bank s total assets  acquiring up to of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors  trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions  and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met 
washington state has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity 
primarily  the law affords washington chartered commercial banks the same powers as washington chartered savings banks 
in order for a bank to exercise these powers  it must provide days notice to the director of the washington department of financial institutions and the director must authorize the requested activity 
in addition  the law provides that washington chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers that the federal reserve has determined to be closely related to the business of banking and the powers of national banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations 
the law also provides that washington chartered savings banks may exercise any of the powers of washington chartered commercial banks  national banks and federally chartered savings banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations 
finally  the law provides additional flexibility for washington chartered commercial and savings banks with respect to interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit 
specifically  they may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally chartered financial institutions to washington residents 
environmental issues associated with real estate lending 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present owners and operators of sites containing hazardous waste 
however  congress asked to protect secured creditors by providing that the term owner and operator excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site 
since the enactment of the cercla  this secured creditor exemption has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan 
to the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area  all creditors  including banner bank and islanders bank  that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination such as petroleum contamination could be subject to liability for cleanup costs  which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property

the federal reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period not exceeding five years specified by the statutory law of the host state 
nor may the federal reserve approve an application if the applicant and its depository institution affiliates controls or would control more than of the insured deposits in the united states or or more of the deposits in the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
individual states may also waive the state wide concentration limit contained in the federal law 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to june  which applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks

dividends the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws  a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
the company has been informed that it may not declare or pay any dividends on its common or preferred stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve 
capital requirements the federal reserve has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements of the fdic for the banks  although the federal reserve regulations provide for the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities for up to of tier capital in determining compliance with the guidelines 
the federal reserve regulations provide that capital standards will be applied on a consolidated basis in the case of a bank holding company with million or more in total consolidated assets 
the guidelines require that a company s total risk based capital must equal of risk weighted assets and one half of the must consist of tier core capital 
as of december   banner corporation s total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets and its tier core capital was of risk weighted assets

item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below  other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
risks associated with our business our business may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which we depend 
our operations are significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions 
substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
all of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in these three states 
a continuing decline in the economies of the markets in which we operate  in particular the puget sound area of washington state  the portland  oregon metropolitan area and the agricultural regions of the columbia basin  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in particular  washington  oregon and idaho have experienced home price declines  increased foreclosures and high unemployment rates 
as a result of our high concentration of our customer base in the puget sound area of washington state  the deterioration of businesses in the puget sound area  or one or more businesses with a large employee base in that area  also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  weakness in the global economy has adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade 
a further deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations demand for our products and services may decline  loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  collateral for loans made may decline further in value  and the amount of our low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease 
declining property values have increased the loan to value ratios on a significant portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio  which exposes us to greater risk of loss 
many of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated the loan with a relatively high combined loan to value ratio or because of the decline in home values in our market areas 
residential loans with high combined loan to value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan to value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses 
in addition  if the borrowers sell their homes  such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds 
as a result  these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
we originate construction and land loans  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural loans as well as residential mortgage loans primarily within our market areas 
generally  the types of loans other than the residential mortgage loans have a higher risk of loss than the residential mortgage loans 
we had approximately billion outstanding in these types of higher risk loans at december  compared to approximately billion at december  these loans typically have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons construction and land loans 
at december   construction and land loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
this type of lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
in addition  speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre sold  and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences 
loans on land under development or held for future construction also poses additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral 
these risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions 
as a result  this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest 
while our origination of these types of loans has decreased significantly in the last two years  we continue to have significant levels of construction loan balances 
most of our construction loans are for the construction of single family residences 
reflecting the current slowdown in the residential market  the secondary market for land and construction loans is not readily liquid  so we have less opportunity to mitigate our credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans 
if we foreclose on a construction loan  our holding period for the collateral typically may be longer than we have historically experienced because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral 
the decline in the number of potential purchasers has contributed to the decline in the value of these loans 
accordingly  charge offs on construction and land loans may be larger than those incurred by other segments of our loan portfolio 
at december   construction and land loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans 
at december   commercial and multifamily loans were billion or of our total loan portfolio 
these loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service  which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment  which may increase the risk of default or non payment 
this risk is exacerbated in the current economic environment 
at december   commercial and multifamily loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
commercial business loans 
at december   commercial business loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
the borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise  may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december   commercial business loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
agricultural loans 
at december   agricultural loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates among others 
collateral securing these loans may be difficult to evaluate  manage or liquidate and may not provide an adequate source of repayment 
at december   agricultural loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
consumer loans 
at december   consumer loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
at december   consumer loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
our provision for loan losses and net loan charge offs have increased significantly and we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  compared to million for the year ended december  we also recorded net loan charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we are experiencing elevated levels of loan delinquencies and credit losses 
slower sales  excess inventory and declining prices have been the primary causes of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures for construction and land development loans which  including related real estate owned  represent of our non performing assets at december  at december   our total non performing assets had increased to million compared to million at december  further  our portfolio is concentrated in construction and land loans  commercial business and commercial real estate loans  all of which generally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans 
if current weak conditions in the housing and real estate markets continue  we expect that we will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if general economic weakness is prolonged  we expect that could severely impact economic conditions in our market areas and that we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or the project being financed  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  in the case of a collateralized loan  the duration of the loan  the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower  and changes in economic and industry conditions 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio 
the amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors  including  but not limited to our general reserve  based on our historical default and loss experience  certain macroeconomic factors  and management s expectations of future events  and our specific reserve  based on our evaluation of non performing loans and their underlying collateral 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and loss and delinquency experience  and evaluate economic conditions and make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
if our estimates are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses 
continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans at december  in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the provision for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and capital 
we are subject to various regulatory requirements  expect to be subject to a memorandum of understanding and may be subject to future additional regulatory restrictions and enforcement actions 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  the washington dfi and the federal reserve board  and separately the fdic as insurer of each of the bank s deposits  have authority to compel or restrict certain actions if either of the banks capital should fall below adequate capital standards as a result of operating losses  or if its regulators otherwise determine that it has insufficient capital or is otherwise operating in an unsafe and unsound manner 
among other matters  the corrective actions may include  but are not limited to  requiring us or the banks to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including memoranda of understanding  written agreements  supervisory letters  commitment letters  and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and refrain from unsafe and unsound practices  removing officers and directors and assessing civil monetary penalties  terminating the banks fdic insurance  requiring us to enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  and taking possession of and closing and liquidating either or both of the banks 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to impose cross guarantee liability against banner bank or islanders bank for any loss incurred by the fdic  or any loss the fdic reasonably anticipates incurring  in connection with the failure of one of the banks or in connection with any assistance provided by the fdic to one of the banks in danger of failure 
in light of the current challenging operating environment  along with our elevated level of non performing assets  delinquencies  and adversely classified assets and our recent operating results  we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny as well as increased fdic premiums as a result of the potential risk of loss in our loan portfolio 
following the regulators most recent examination of banner bank as of june   and the federal reserve examination of banner corporation as of september   we and banner bank expect to become subject to a memorandum of understanding mou with the washington dfi and the fdic 
we expect that  under the mou  banner bank will be required  among other things  to develop and implement plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to improve asset quality and reduce classified assets  to improve profitability  and to increase tier leverage capital to equal or exceed of average assets 
in addition  we expect to be required to retain management and directors acceptable to the washington dfi and the fdic 
lastly  it is expected that banner bank will not be able to pay cash dividends to banner corporation without prior approval from the fdic and washington dfi 
no assurance can be given that our current management and directors are acceptable to the washington dfi or the fdic  that we will be able to retain or engage management and directors who are acceptable to the dfi or the fdic or that we will be able to meet the requirements of the memoranda in a timely manner 
the company and banner bank must obtain prior regulatory approval before adding any new director or senior executive officer or changing the responsibilities of any current senior executive officer 
the company and banner bank also may not pay pursuant to or enter into certain severance and other forms of compensation agreements without regulatory approval 
in addition  the company may not declare or pay any dividends on common or preferred stock  pay interest or principal on the balance of its junior subordinated debentures or repurchase our common stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve bank and must notify the federal reserve bank prior to making any unusual or large payments 
further  banner bank requires the approval of the fdic to participate in any additional borrowings under the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
if we did not comply with the requirements imposed on us by the federal reserve bank or were unable to meet the requirements of the expected memoranda from the washington dfi and the fdic in a timely manner  we could become subject to additional supervisory action  including a consent order 
if our banking supervisors were to take such additional supervisory action  we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
in addition  the fdic has the power to deem either of the banks to be only adequately capitalized even though its capital ratios meet the well capitalized standard 
in such event  such bank would be prohibited from using brokered deposits  which have been a source of funds for us in recent years  and rates on deposits would be limited to market rates determined by the fdic  potentially adversely affecting our liquidity 
the terms of any such corrective action could have a material negative effect on our business  our financial condition and the value of our common stock 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to further supervisory action or regulatory proceedings 
our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or be required by our regulators to increase our capital resources 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators  we may be subject to adverse regulatory action 
see we are subject to various regulatory requirements and may be subject to future additional regulatory restrictions and enforcement actions 
we may have continuing losses and significant variation in our quarterly results 
we reported a net loss of million available to common shareholders during the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million during the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  primarily resulted from our high level of non performing assets and the resultant reduction in interest income and increased provision for loan losses 
all of our goodwill has been written off  however  we may continue to suffer further losses as a result of credit related factors 
in addition  several other factors affecting our business can cause significant variations in our quarterly results of operations 
in particular  variations in the volume of our loan originations and sales  the differences between our cost of funds and the average interest rate earned on investments  special fdic insurance charges  significant changes in real estate valuations and the fair valuation of our junior subordinated debentures or our investment securities portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses  or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves  our earnings could be reduced 
we obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned reo and at certain other times during the assets holding period 
our net book value nbv in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs fair value 
a charge off is recorded for any excess in the asset s nbv over its fair value 
if our valuation process is incorrect  or if property values decline  the fair value of the investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets  resulting in the need for additional charge offs 
significant charge offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our reo and may require us to recognize further charge offs 
any increase in our charge offs  as required by the bank regulators  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by continued disruptions in securities markets 
the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
these market conditions have affected and may further detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations because of the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
an increase in interest rates  change in the programs offered by governmental sponsored entities gse or our ability to qualify for such programs may reduce our mortgage revenues  which would negatively impact our non interest income 
our mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our non interest income 
we generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by fannie mae  freddie mac and non gse investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
any future changes in these programs  our eligibility to participate in such programs  the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could  in turn  materially adversely affect our results of operations 
further  in a rising or higher interest rate environment  our originations of mortgage loans may decrease  resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors 
this would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in non interest income 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the amount of non interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs 
during periods of reduced loan demand  our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations 
fluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference  or spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings  and other interest bearing liabilities 
because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we principally manage interest rate risk by managing the volume  mix and interest rate sensitivity of our earning assets and funding liabilities 
in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to manage this risk effectively 
changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate and or sell loans  the value of our interest earning assets  which would negatively impact stockholders equity  our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets and the collateral value of pledged assets  our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives  and the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including government monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
further  a significant portion of our adjustable rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan s contractual interest rate may not adjust 
approximately of our loan portfolio was comprised of adjustable or floating rate loans at december   and approximately billion  or  of those loans contained interest rate floors  below which the loans contractual interest rate may not adjust 
at december   the weighted average floor interest rate of these loans was 
at that date  approximately billion  or  of these loans were at their floor interest rate 
the inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates  although this result is subject to the risks that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates 
also  when loans are at their floors  there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
our investment in federal home loan bank stock may be impaired 
at december   we owned million of stock of the federal home loan bank of seattle  or fhlb 
as a condition of membership at the fhlb  we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of fhlb stock 
our stock purchase requirement is based  in part  upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the fhlb and is calculated in accordance with the capital plan of the fhlb 
our fhlb stock has a par value of  is carried at cost  and is subject to recoverability testing 
the fhlb announced that it had a risk based capital deficiency under the regulations of the federal housing finance agency the fhfa  its primary regulator  as of december   and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock 
as a result  the fhlb has not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of the fhlb has communicated that it believes the calculation of risk based capital under the current rules of the fhfa significantly overstates the market risk of the fhlb s private label mortgage backed securities in the current market environment and that it has enough capital to cover the risks reflected in its balance sheet 
as a result  we have not recorded an impairment on our investment in fhlb stock 
however  continued deterioration in the fhlb s financial position may result in impairment in the value of those securities 
we will continue to monitor the financial condition of the fhlb as it relates to  among other things  the recoverability of our investment 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments will negatively impact our earnings 
beginning in late  the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures  which dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  the fdic has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
the base assessment rate was increased by seven basis points seven cents for every of deposits for the first quarter of effective april   initial base assessment rates were changed to range from basis points to basis points across all risk categories with possible adjustments to these rates based on certain debt related components 
these increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings 
in addition  in may  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
the emergency assessment amounted to five basis points on each institution s assets minus tier capital as of june   subject to a maximum equal to basis points times the institution s assessment base 
our fdic deposit insurance expense for the year ended december  was million  including the special assessment of million recorded in june and paid on september  any additional emergency special assessment imposed by the fdic will negatively impact our earnings 
continued weak or worsening credit availability could limit our ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand  which could adversely affect our earnings and capital levels 
continued weak or worsening credit availability and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may negatively affect asset growth and  consequently  our earnings capability and capital levels 
in addition to any deposit growth  maturity of investment securities and loan payments  we rely from time to time on advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle  borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits 
if the economy does not improve or continues to deteriorate  these additional funding sources could be negatively affected  which could limit the funds available to us 
our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we are unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank of seattle  the federal reserve bank of san francisco or other wholesale funding sources 
failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our performance 
our financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to manage past and possible future growth 
future acquisitions and our continued growth may present operating  integration and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business and the inability to obtain adequate funding may negatively affect growth and  consequently  our earnings capability and capital levels 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the washington  oregon or idaho markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued uncertainty in credit markets 
in addition  recent changes in the collateralization requirements and other provisions of the washington and oregon public funds deposit programs have changed the economic benefit associated with accepting public funds deposits  which may affect our need to utilize alternative sources of liquidity 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions  including transactions in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
although these fdic assisted transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we are and would be in future transactions subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect 
in addition  because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition  we may face additional risks in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations  including changes that may restrict our ability to foreclose on single family home loans and offer overdraft protection 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds  and the banking system as a whole  and not holders of our common stock 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy  and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations  and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations  or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statues  regulations  or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  restrict mergers and acquisitions  investments  access to capital  the location of banking offices  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputational damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
new legislation proposed by congress may give bankruptcy courts the power to reduce the increasing number of home foreclosures by giving bankruptcy judges the authority to restructure mortgages and reduce a borrower s payments 
property owners would be allowed to keep their property while working out their debts 
bills placing temporary moratoriums on foreclosure sales or otherwise modifying foreclosure procedures to the benefit of borrowers and the detriment of lenders may be enacted by either congress or in the states of washington  oregon and idaho in the future 
these laws may further restrict our collection efforts on one to four single family mortgage loans 
additional legislation recently enacted by congress and federal regulations effective in give current debit card holders the chance to opt out of an overdraft protection program and limit overdraft fees  which could result in additional operational costs and a reduction in our non interest income 
further  our regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
in this regard  banking regulators are considering additional regulations governing compensation which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
on june   the obama administration published a comprehensive regulatory reform plan that is intended to modernize and protect the integrity of the united states financial system 
the reform plan proposes  among other matters  the creation of a new federal agency  the consumer financial protection agency  that would be dedicated to protecting consumers in the financial products and services market 
the creation of this agency could result in new regulatory requirements and raise the cost of regulatory compliance 
in addition  legislation stemming from the reform plan could require changes in regulatory capital requirements  and compensation practices 
if implemented  the foregoing regulatory reforms may have a material impact on our operations 
however  because the legislation needed to implement the president s reform plan has not been introduced  and because the final legislation may differ significantly from the legislation proposed by the administration  we cannot determine the specific impact of regulatory reform at this time 
our litigation related costs might continue to increase 
the banks are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the banks business 
in the current economic environment  the banks involvement in litigation has increased significantly  primarily as a result of defaulted borrowers asserting claims to defeat or delay foreclosure proceedings 
the banks believe that they have meritorious defenses in legal actions where they have been named as defendants and are vigorously defending these suits 
although management  based on discussion with litigation counsel  believes that such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the banks  there can be no assurance that a resolution of any such legal matters will not result in significant liability to the banks nor have a material adverse impact on their financial condition and results of operations or the banks ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements 
moreover  the expenses of pending legal proceedings will adversely affect the banks results of operations until they are resolved 
there can be no assurance that the banks loan workout and other activities will not expose the banks to additional legal actions  including lender liability or environmental claims 
because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
pursuant to the terms of the tarp capital purchase program  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds an investment in us 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act  further compensation restrictions  including significant limitations on incentive compensation  have been imposed on our senior executive officers and most highly compensated employees 
such restrictions and any future restrictions on executive compensation which may be adopted  could adversely affect our ability to hire and retain senior executive officers 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the community banking industry where the banks conduct their business 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
in addition  the american recovery and reinvestment act has imposed significant limitations on executive compensation for recipients  such as us  of funds under the tarp capital purchase program  which may make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit key personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives  including our president  and certain other employees 
in addition  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the services of our directors  many of whom are at or nearing retirement age  and we may not be able to identify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors 
our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes 
our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes 
nationally  reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased 
we have also experienced an increase in apparent fraud and other financial crimes  however  we have not recently experienced material losses due to such crimes 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses  there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
we rely on communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers  and we may suffer an interruption in those systems 
we rely heavily on third party service providers for much of our communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology  including our internet banking services and data processing systems 
any failure or interruption of these services or systems or breaches in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  servicing and or loan origination systems 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services  and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all 
our assets as of december  include a deferred tax asset and we may not be able to realize the full amount of such asset 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at december   the net deferred tax asset was approximately million  an increase from a balance of approximately million at december  the net deferred tax asset results primarily from our provisions for loan losses recorded for financial reporting purposes  which has been significantly larger than net loan charge offs deducted for tax reporting proposes 
the net deferred tax asset is also significantly affected by valuation adjustments for securities and junior subordinated debentures which are recognized for financial reporting purposes  and are not currently deductible for federal income tax reporting purposes 
a consequence of a large sale of our common stock could be that we experience an ownership change as defined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended which is generally a greater than a percentage point increase by certain shareholders over a rolling three year period 
section imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of deferred tax assets  such as net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes  once an ownership change has occurred 
depending on the size of the annual limitation which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of the ownership change and the remaining carryforward period of the tax assets us federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of years  we could realize a permanent loss of a portion of our us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain built in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
we believe the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  is fully realizable  however  we would not know the impact of an ownership change until after the offering is completed 
however  based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of such ownership change on our deferred tax assets  we believe that the impact on our deferred tax assets is unlikely to be material 
this is a preliminary and complex analysis and requires the company to make certain judgments in determining the annual limitation 
as a result  it is possible that we could ultimately lose a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset  we would adjust this deferred tax asset  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
if we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures or if certain defaults relating to those debentures occur  we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on  and from making liquidation payments with respect to  our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount million at fair value of junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities through statutory business trusts 
we have also guaranteed these trust preferred securities 
there are currently six separate series of these junior subordinated debentures outstanding  each series having been issued under a separate indenture and with a separate guarantee 
each of these indentures  together with the related guarantee  prohibits us  subject to limited exceptions  from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on  or redeeming  repurchasing  acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to  any of our capital stock at any time when i there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under such indenture or any event  act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under such indenture  ii we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under such guarantee  or iii we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures outstanding under that indenture 
in that regard  we are entitled  at our option but subject to certain conditions  to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures of each series from time to time for up to five years 
events of default under the indenture generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities under certain circumstances  our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debt securities when due  our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture  and certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation relating to us or the bank 
as a result of these provisions  if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on any series of junior subordinated debentures  or if any of the other events described in clause i or ii of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur  we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock  from repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any such common stock  and from making any payments to holders of common stock in the event of our liquidation  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
moreover  without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock  we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debentures in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debentures or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock  including our common stock 
also  banner may not pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow us to make payments on our junior subordinated debentures 
item b unresolved staff comments none 
item properties banner corporation maintains its administrative offices and main branch office  which is owned by us  in walla walla  washington 
in total  as of december   we have branch offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
three of those are islanders bank branches and are banner bank branches 
sixty four branches are located in washington  sixteen in oregon and nine in idaho 
of those offices  approximately half are owned and the other half are leased facilities 
we also have nine leased locations for loan production offices spread throughout the same three state area 
the lease terms for our branch and loan production offices are not individually material 
lease expirations range from one to years 
administrative support offices are primarily in washington  where we have nine facilities  of which we own two and lease seven 
additionally  we have one leased administrative support office in idaho and own one located in oregon 
in the opinion of management  all properties are adequately covered by insurance  are in a good state of repair and are appropriately designed for their present and future use 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have various legal proceedings and other contingent matters outstanding 
these proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable 
these claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to action to enforce liens on properties in which we hold a security interest 
we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations

year ended december  high low cash dividend declared first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  high low cash dividend declared first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  high low cash dividend declared first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the timing and amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock depends on our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other relevant factors and is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
after consideration of these factors  beginning in  we reduced our dividend payout to preserve our capital 
on october   we paid our shareholders a dividend of per share 
there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future 
the federal reserve bank of san francisco has also notified us that we may not declare or pay any dividends on common or preferred stock or pay interest or principal on the balance of its junior subordinated debentures without their prior written non objection 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends primarily on dividends we receive from banner bank and islanders bank 
under federal regulations  the dollar amount of dividends the banks may pay depends upon their capital position and recent net income 
generally  if a bank satisfies its regulatory capital requirements  it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed under state law and fdic regulations 
however  an institution that has converted to a stock form of ownership may not declare or pay a dividend on  or repurchase any of  its common stock if the effect thereof would cause the regulatory capital of the institution to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established in connection with the conversion 
banner bank  our primary subsidiary  converted to a stock form of ownership and is therefore subject to the limitation described in the preceding sentence 
in addition  under washington law  no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings 
the washington dfi has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends 
further  under washington law  banner corporation is prohibited from paying a dividend if  after making such dividend payment  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or if its total liabilities  plus the amount that would be needed  in the event banner corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment  to satisfy preferential rights on dissolution of holders of preferred stock ranking senior in right of payment to the capital stock on which the applicable distribution is to be made  exceed our total assets 
in addition to the foregoing regulatory considerations  there are numerous governmental requirements and regulations that affect our business activities 
a change in applicable statutes  regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business and on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above  certain contractual provisions limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
the securities purchase agreement between us and the treasury  pursuant to which we issued our series a preferred stock and warrant as part of the tarp capital purchase program  provides that prior to the earlier of i november  and ii the date on which all of the shares of the series a preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by treasury to third parties  we may not  without the consent of the treasury  a pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of more than 
per share or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock  other than the series a preferred stock  or any trust preferred securities then outstanding 
in addition  under the terms of the series a preferred stock  we may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the series a preferred stock 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are payable quarterly at a rate of per annum for the first five years and a rate of per annum thereafter if not redeemed prior to that time

the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington and own two subsidiary banks  banner bank and islanders bank 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and  as of december   its branch offices and seven loan production offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
islanders bank is also a washington chartered commercial bank and conducts its business from three locations in san juan county  washington 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
the banks primary business is that of traditional banking institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding their offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
lending activities include commercial business and commercial real estate loans  agriculture business loans  construction and land development loans  one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
deteriorating economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets which accelerated throughout and generally continued in have presented an unusually challenging environment for banks and their holding companies  including banner corporation 
this has been particularly evident in our need to provide for credit losses during this period at significantly higher levels than our historical experience and has also affected our net interest income and other operating revenues and expenses 
as a result of these factors  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend and related discount accretion  resulted in a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the results in included a million impairment charge for the write off of goodwill 
although there are indications of moderation  this stress in the economy has been the most significant challenge impacting our recent operating results and  like most financial institutions  our future operating results will be significantly affected by the course of recovery from the current recession 
our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million recorded in the prior year 
the significant provision for loan losses in both years reflects material levels of delinquencies  non performing loans and net charge offs  particularly for loans for the construction of one to four family homes and for acquisition and development of land for residential properties 
for most of the past two years  housing markets remained weak in many of our primary services areas  resulting in elevated levels of delinquencies and non performing assets  deterioration in property values  particularly for residential land and building lots  and the need to provide for realized and anticipated losses 
by contrast  other non housing related segments of our loan portfolio  while showing some signs of stress  have performed as expected with only normal levels of credit problems given the serious economic slowdown 
throughout and  the higher than historical provision for loan losses has been the most significant factor affecting our operating results and  while we are encouraged by the continuing reduction in our exposure to residential construction loans and the recent slowdown in the surfacing of new problem assets  looking forward we anticipate our credit costs will remain elevated for a number of quarters and will have a continuing adverse effect on our earnings during see note  allowance for loan losses  as well as asset quality below 
aside from the level of loan loss provision  our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  composed primarily of customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is primarily a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased by million for the year ended december  to million compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of a contraction in our net interest spread and net interest margin as asset yields have declined sharply over the past two years in response to the federal reserve s monetary policy actions designed to dramatically lower short term interest rates 
further  as well as affecting the amount of our loan loss provision  increased delinquencies and the resulting increased levels of non accrual loans and other non performing assets have had an adverse impact on our net interest margin 
nonetheless  net interest income and the net interest margin improved meaningfully in the second half of as rapidly declining interest expense on deposits contributed to significantly lower funding costs and the trend of lower funding costs accelerated in the final quarter of our net income also is affected by the level of our other operating income  including deposit fees and service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our non interest operating expenses and income tax provisions 
in addition  our net income is affected by the net change in the value of certain financial instruments carried at fair value 
see note  fair value accounting and measurement 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net gain of million million after tax in fair value adjustments compared to a net gain of million million after tax for the year ended december  further  reflecting unprecedented difficulties in the operating environment for banking institutions and deteriorating market conditions  for the year ended december   our net income also included a million non cash  non tax deductible impairment charge for the write off of goodwill 
other operating income  excluding the fair value adjustments  increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of increased gain on the sale of loans from mortgage banking operations somewhat offset by a reduction in loan servicing fees 
revenues net interest income before the provision for loan losses plus other operating income  excluding fair value adjustments  decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   as the increased non interest revenues were not sufficient to offset the decrease in net interest income 
other operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase from million  excluding the goodwill write off  for the year ended december  the current year s expenses reflect significantly increased deposit insurance expense  elevated costs associated with problem loan collection activities including professional services and charges related to real estate owned  and increased advertising  which were generally offset by reductions in compensation  occupancy  payment and card processing and miscellaneous expenses 
as noted above  in the year ended december   our net income included an million net gain in the valuation of the selected financial assets and liabilities we record at fair value 
the fair value adjustment resulted in a reduction of million net after tax  or per share diluted  to the net loss reported for the year ended december  by comparison  the million fair value gain in the prior year resulted in a reduction of million net after tax  or per share diluted to the net loss 
excluding the net fair value adjustments and the goodwill impairment in  the net loss from core operations was million million available to common shareholders for the year ended december   compared to million million available to common shareholders for the year ended december  earnings or loss from core operations and other earnings information excluding the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and goodwill impairment charges represent non gaap financial measures 
management has presented these non gaap financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations 
where applicable  we have also presented comparable earnings information using gaap financial measures 
the decrease in earnings from core operations primarily reflects the increased loan loss provisioning  narrower net interest margin  higher fdic insurance charges and increased collection costs 
see comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and for more detailed information about our financial performance 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the past two years our origination of construction and land development loans has declined materially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has declined 
by contrast  residential mortgage loan originations in have significantly increased  primarily reflecting the impact of exceptionally low interest rates on the demand for loans to refinance existing debt  although loans to finance home purchases also increased in the two most recent quarters 
our real estate lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the current recession  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been weak  however  total outstanding balances have remained nearly unchanged 
we have also increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although demand for consumer loans also has been modest in recent quarters 
still  the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans has increased and is now of total loans 
while continuing our commitment to residential lending  including our mortgage banking activities  we expect commercial lending including owner occupied commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural loans and consumer lending to become increasingly more important activities for us 
by contrast  we anticipate residential construction and related land development lending  which at december  represented of the loan portfolio  compared to a year earlier  will continue to be restrained by market conditions for the foreseeable future  as well as by our efforts to reduce our concentration in this type of lending  with balances continuing to decline for a number of quarters 
we also expect non owner occupied investor commercial real estate lending  for both construction and longer term financing  to be curtailed with balances declining for the foreseeable future 
deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
the long term success of our deposit gathering activities is reflected not only in the growth of deposit balances  but also in increases in the level of deposit fees  service charges and other payment processing revenues compared to periods prior to that expansion 
for the year ended december   our deposit balances increased modestly despite our decision to significantly reduce our exposure to public funds deposits  as the new higher collateralization requirements and the shared risk exposure under washington and oregon state regulations have made retaining these deposits less desirable than in the past 
in addition  although brokered deposits have never been an important component of our funding  we also chose to reduce brokered deposits by million over the same twelve month period 
excluding the effects of public and brokered deposits  retail deposit growth for the year ended december  was very strong  however  payment processing revenues declined modestly  reflecting the adverse effect of the soft economy on activity levels for deposit customers  debit and credit cardholders and merchants 
we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability  matching deposit and loan products  and customer preferences and concerns 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to i the methodology for the recognition of interest income  ii determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses  iii the valuation of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  iv the valuation of intangibles such as goodwill  core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights and v the valuation of real estate held for sale 
these policies and judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail below 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
further  subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and our financial condition and operating results in future periods 
there have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since december  for additional information concerning critical accounting policies  see notes    and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the following interest income notes interest on loans and securities is accrued as earned unless management doubts the collectability of the asset or the unpaid interest 
interest accruals on loans are generally discontinued when loans become days past due for payment of interest and the loans are then placed on nonaccrual status 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from interest income upon transfer to nonaccrual status 
for any future payments collected  interest income is recognized only upon management s assessment that there is a strong likelihood that the full amount of a loan will be repaid or recovered 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this policy would dictate if  in management s judgment  the interest may be uncollectable 
while less common  similar interest reversal and nonaccrual treatment is applied to investment securities if their ultimate collectability becomes questionable 
provision and allowance for loan losses notes the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in asc  contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and value impaired loans consistent with the accounting guidelines outlined in asc  receivables 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared 
although we use the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on our continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio  including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience and current economic conditions  as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by us at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding those loans that are subject to individual analysis for specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant environmental considerations  including the experience of other banking organizations  that in our judgment affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
fair value accounting and measurement notes and we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we include in the notes to the consolidated financial statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose  where appropriate  our estimate of their fair value 
the accounting standards define fair value  establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date 
among other things  the standards require us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable 
in accordance with the standards  it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
however  in certain instances  when market observable inputs are not available  we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or other observable inputs  requiring a change in the method  judgments and assumptions used to estimate fair value for specific instruments from that which was used in prior periods 
the disruption of certain financial markets and lack of meaningful transaction activity for certain securities beginning in and continuing in has made estimating fair values more difficult and less reliable than in prior years 
goodwill and other intangible assets notes and goodwill and other intangible assets consists primarily of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method  and core deposit intangibles cdi  which are amounts recorded in business combinations or deposit purchase transactions related to the value of transaction related deposits and the value of the customer relationships associated with the deposits 
prior to december   the largest component of our intangible assets was goodwill which arose from business combinations completed in previous periods 
however  for the year ended december   we recorded million of impairment charges  which eliminated all of the goodwill previously carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
the other major component of our intangible assets is core deposit intangibles  which is the value ascribed to the long term deposit relationships arising from acquisitions 
core deposit intangibles are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a weighted average estimated useful life of eight years 
these assets are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances that could impact their recoverability 
these events could include loss of the underlying core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent other identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable  impairment losses are recorded in other non interest expense to reduce the carrying amount of the assets 
real estate held for sale property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value  less cost to sell  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
development and improvement costs relating to the property are capitalized 
the carrying value of the property is periodically evaluated by management and  if necessary  allowances are established to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
gains or losses at the time the property is sold are charged or credited to operations in the period in which they are realized 
the amounts the banks will ultimately recover from real estate held for sale may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the banks control or because of changes in the banks strategies for recovering the investment 
adoption and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in august  fasb issued asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value 
this update amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosure  in regards to the fair value measurement of liabilities 
fasb asc clarifies that in circumstances in which a quoted price for an identical liability in an active market is not available  a reporting entity shall utilize one or more of the following techniques i the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  ii the quoted price for a similar liability or for a similar liability when traded as an asset  or iii another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of asc in all instances a reporting entity shall utilize the approach that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs 
also  when measuring the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity shall not include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this update is effective for the company in the fourth quarter of and the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  fasb amended the accounting standard for subsequent events 
the updated standard  asc  established general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the revisions did not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports  either through recognition or disclosure in its financial statements 
it does require disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
the company adopted the provisions of this guidance for the interim period ended june   and the effect of adoption on the company s consolidated financial statements was not material 
in april  fasb revised accounting standards for financial instruments 
the revised standard  asc  requires fair value disclosures in the notes of an entity s interim financial statements for all financial instruments  whether or not recognized in the statement of financial position 
this revision became effective for the interim reporting period ending after june  the adoption of the revised standards and the increased interim financial statement disclosures did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  fasb revised accounting standards for investments debt and equity securities 
the standard  asc  changes the other than temporary impairment otti model for debt securities 
under previous guidance  an entity was required to assess whether it has the intent and ability to hold a security to recovery in determining whether an impairment of that security is other than temporary 
if the impairment was deemed other than temporarily impaired  the investment was written down to fair value through earnings 
under the revised guidance  otti is triggered if an entity has the intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery  or if the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
if the entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis  the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
if the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that the entity will be required to sell the security but the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
the credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected of a security 
projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential otti 
the remaining impairment loss related to all other factors  the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value  would be recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
impairment losses related to all other factors are to be presented as a separate category within oci 
for investment securities held to maturity  this amount is accreted over the remaining life of the debt security prospectively based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
the accretion of the otti amount recorded in oci will increase the carrying value of the investment and would not affect earnings 
if there is an indication of additional credit losses  the security is reevaluated accordingly based on the procedures described above 
upon adoption of the revised guidance  the noncredit portion of previously recognized otti is to be reclassified to accumulated oci by a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
these revisions became effective in the interim reporting period ending after june  we adopted these revisions for the quarter ended june  and the effect of the adoption on the consolidated financial statements was not material 
in april  fasb amended accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the amended standard  asc  addresses issues related to the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased  and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the revisions affirm the objective that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions  even if the market is inactive 
the amendment provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have decreased significantly 
it also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
if it is determined that a quoted price is distressed not orderly  and thereby not representative of fair value  the entity may need to make adjustments to the quoted price or utilize an alternative valuation technique eg  income approach or multiple valuation techniques to determine fair value 
additionally  an entity must incorporate appropriate risk premium adjustments  reflective of an orderly transaction under current market conditions  due to uncertainty in cash flows 
the revised guidance requires disclosures in interim and annual periods regarding the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques and related inputs  if any  during the period 
it also requires financial institutions to disclose the fair values of investment securities by major security type 
the changes are effective for the interim reporting period ending after june   and are to be applied prospectively 
the requirements of these amendments are consistent with the company s practice of calculating fair value on the various assets and liabilities it carries at fair value 
therefore  there was no material impact on the fair value measurement of any assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb amended accounting standards for investments other 
the amended standard  asc  addresses certain practices or issues related to the recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  by making its otti assessment guidance consistent with the accounting standards for investments debt and equity securities 
the amendment removes the reference to the consideration of a market participant s estimates of cash flows and instead requires an assessment of whether it is probable  based on current information and events  that the holder of the security will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
if it is probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows  an otti is deemed to exist  and a corresponding loss shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s carrying value and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made 
this amendment became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   and is applied prospectively 
the amendment of these standards did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  fasb amended accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the amended standard  asc  clarifies the application of fair value measurements in a market that is not active 
the amendment is intended to address the following application issues a how the reporting entity s own assumptions that is  expected cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable inputs do not exist  b how available observable inputs in a market that is not active should be considered when measuring fair value  and c how the use of market quotes for example  broker quotes or pricing services for the same or similar financial assets should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable inputs available to measure fair value 
the changes were effective on issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
we adopted the amendment for the quarter ended december  and the effect of adoption on the consolidated financial statements was not material 
in december  fasb revised accounting standards for business combinations 
the standard  asc  requires the acquiring entity to recognize and measure in its financial statements all the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquired entity  and the goodwill acquired and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
furthermore  acquisition related and other costs will now be expensed rather than treated as cost components of the acquisition 
asc also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the revision to this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of these revisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as related to business combinations consummated prior to january  the adoption of these revisions will increase the costs charged to operations for acquisitions consummated on or after january  recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb asu no 
requires i fair value disclosures by each class of assets and liabilities generally a subset within a line item as presented in the statement of financial position rather than major category  ii for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the amounts of significant transfers between levels and  and transfers into and out of level  and the reasons for those transfers  including separate discussion related to the transfers into each level apart from transfers out of each level  and iii gross presentation of the amounts of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the level recurring measurement reconciliation 
additionally  the asu clarifies that a description of the valuation techniques s and inputs used to measure fair values is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
also  if a valuation technique has changed  entities should disclose that change and the reason for the change 
disclosures other than the gross presentation changes in the level reconciliation are effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the requirement to present the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of fasb asu no 
we do not expect the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no

asu eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this statement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november   and for interim periods therein 
this standard will primarily impact the company s accounting and reporting of transfers representing a portion of a financial asset for which the company has a continuing involvement 
in order to recognize the transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  the transferred portion and any portion that continues to be held by the transferor must represent a participating interest  and the transfer of the participating interest must meet the conditions for surrender of control 
to qualify as a participating interest  i the portions of a financial asset must represent a proportionate ownership interest in an entire financial asset  ii from the date of transfer  all cash flows received from the entire financial asset must be divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership  iii involve no recourse other than standard representation and warranties to  or subordination by  any participating interest holder  and iv no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset 
if the participating interest or surrender of control criteria are not met  the transfer is not accounted for as a sale and derecognition of the asset is not appropriate 
rather  the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing arrangement 
the impact of certain participations being reported as secured borrowings rather than derecognizing a portion of a financial asset would increase total assets  liabilities and their respective interest income and expense 
an increase in total assets also increases regulatory risk weighted assets and could negatively impact our capital ratios 
the company does not believe the impact of adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this update codifies sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which was previously issued by fasb in june but was not included in the original codification 
asu eliminates fasb interpretations r fin r exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities  contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
the new guidance also contains a new requirement that any term  transaction  or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity s status as a variable interest entity  a company s power over a variable interest entity  or a company s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying the previous provisions 
the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments 
this statement requires additional disclosures regarding an entity s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this statement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november   and for interim periods therein 
the company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance  but does not anticipate that this new guidance will have any material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general 
total assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  net loans receivable gross loans less loans in process  deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the contraction in net loans was largely due to decreases of million in one to four family construction loans and million in land and land development loans  as well as a decrease of million in commercial business loans and million in commercial construction loans 
these changes were partially offset by increases of million in one to four family mortgage loans  million in commercial real estate loans  million in multi family construction loans 
we continue to maintain a significant  although decreasing  investment in construction and land loans  however  new originations of these types of loans during the past two years has declined substantially and is expected to remain modest for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the much slower pace of new originations and continuing payoffs on existing loans  transfers to real estate owned and charge offs  loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential real estate  which totaled million at december   have decreased by million  or  since their peak quarter end balance of million at june  in addition  land and development loans have decreased by million  or  compared to their peak quarter end balances at march  given the current housing and economic environment  we anticipate that construction and land loan balances will continue to decline for the foreseeable future  although the pace of decline will be more modest as originations of new construction loans likely will increase somewhat as inventories of completed homes have been reduced and the build out of existing development projects will cautiously resume 
securities increased marginally  from million at december   to million at december   as purchases slightly exceeded repayments and net fair value adjustments 
during the year ended december   net fair value adjustments for trading and available for sale securities reduced their carrying values by million 
effective january   we elected to reclassify many of our securities to fair value and  although we have not historically engaged in trading activities  these securities are reported as trading securities for financial reporting purposes 
at december   the fair value of our trading securities was million less than their amortized cost 
the reduction reflected in the fair value of these securities compared to their amortized cost primarily was due to a net decrease of million in the value of single issuer trust preferred securities and collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies as well as a decrease of million in the value of fannie mae and freddie mac common and preferred equity securities  offset by a small gain in all other trading securities 
see note  fair value accounting and measurement  in the selected notes to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  we also acquire securities which are designated as available for sale or held to maturity 
at december   we recorded a decrease of   net of tax in net fair value adjustments related to available for sale securities  which was included as a component of other comprehensive income 
generally  securities designated as held to maturity are reported at their amortized cost for financial reporting purposes 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosures increased million  from million at december  to million at december  the year ending total included million in land or land development projects  million in commercial real estate and million in single family homes 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of loans into real estate owned  capitalized additional investments of million in acquired properties  disposed of approximately million of properties and recognized million of charges for valuation adjustments related to currently owned properties 
see asset quality discussion below 
deposits increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  from million to million  and interest bearing deposits increased by million  to billion at december  in response to the now higher costs of collateralizing public fund deposits and to reduce the shared risk exposure under washington and oregon state regulations  we encouraged the runoff of million in public funds  including million of interest bearing transaction accounts  since december  we anticipate further declines in public fund deposits as we continue to adjust to these new regulations 
in addition  we elected to reduce brokered deposits by million during the year ended december  the decrease in public funds and brokered deposits was more than offset by strong growth in retail deposits during the year 
fhlb advances increased million  from million at december   to million at december   while other borrowings increased million to million at december  the increase in fhlb advances reflects a temporary increase in overnight borrowings at december  as a part of our short term cash management activities and was offset by a comparable increase in interest bearing cash balances 
the increase in other borrowings was the result of an offering completed by banner bank on march   of million of qualifying senior bank notes covered by the tlgp with a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of march  this debt  which does not require any collateralization  was issued to strengthen our overall liquidity position as we adjust to a lower level of public funds deposits 
other borrowings at december  also include million of retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts 
retail repurchase agreements have declined by million during the year ended december   in part reflecting certain customers reduced use of collateralized accounts as a result of increased fdic insurance coverage 
junior subordinated debentures decreased by million since december   reflecting the fair value adjustments as changes in credit market conditions  including a sharp reduction in the level of three month libor  had a particularly significant impact on the valuation of this type of security 
the change in the fair value of the junior subordinated debentures  while significant  represents a non cash valuation adjustment  had no effect on our liquidity or ability to fund our operations and was substantially offset by similar adjustments to certain investment securities as noted above 
see note  fair value of financial instruments 
during the year ended december   we issued  additional shares of common stock for million at an average net per share price of through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase and sale plan 
this stock issuance activity was more than offset by the changes in retained earnings as a result of losses from operations and the accrual of preferred stock dividends  resulting in a net million decrease in stockholders equity 
during the year ended december   we did not issue or repurchase any shares of banner corporation common stock in connection with the exercise of vested stock options and grants 
investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   our aggregate investment in securities was nearly unchanged  increasing by only million 
holdings of us treasury and agency obligations increased million  mortgage backed securities decreased million and municipal bonds increased million 
corporate and other securities decreased million  largely as a result of fair value accounting adjustments for trust preferred securities issued by other financial institutions 
us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a fair value of million million at amortized cost at december   a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity 
these securities are primarily pledged as collateral for retail repurchase agreements 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities totaled million  or of the consolidated investment portfolio 
included within this amount were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with a net carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities at december  was million  which was million more than the amortized cost of million 
at december   our portfolio of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a weighted average coupon rate of 
at that date  of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of the portfolio was years 
we do not believe that any of our mortgage backed obligations had a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
municipal bonds our tax exempt municipal bond portfolio at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost 
at december   general obligation bonds and revenue bonds had total estimated fair values of million and million  respectively 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a portion of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio had a weighted average maturity of approximately years  an average coupon rate of and an average taxable equivalent yield of 
the largest principal balance of any security in the municipal portfolio was a general obligation bond issued by the public hospital district no 
 columbia and walla walla counties  washington  with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which totaled million at fair value million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of long term fixed and adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions  including pooled trust preferred securities 
the market for these capital securities deteriorated significantly in and and in our opinion is not currently functioning in a meaningful manner 
as a result  the fair value estimates for many of these securities are more subjective than in previous periods 
nonetheless  it is apparent that the values have declined appreciably  which is reflected in our financial statements and results of operations 
in addition to the disruption in the market for these securities  the decline in value also reflects deterioration in the financial condition of some of the issuing financial institutions and payment deferrals and defaults by certain institutions

loans lending our net loan portfolio decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or during the year ended december  and an increase of million  or  million was added through acquisitions  in the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
reflecting the current recession  loan demand has been weak for most of the past two years as consumers and businesses have been cautious in their use of credit 
in addition  in response to weak housing markets we significantly curtailed the origination of new residential construction and land development loans 
as a result  our loan growth slowed significantly in and  as noted above  loan portfolio balances declined in looking forward  new loan originations and portfolio balances will be significantly affected by the course of the recovery from the current economic recession 
for the years ended december   and  we originated  net of repayments  million  million and million of loans  respectively 
we generally sell a significant portion of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
loans held for sale decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where we have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
despite slowing economic activity  continued in migration and the unprecedented low mortgage interest rate environment in supported demand for residential loans 
in addition  in the spring of the year we instituted an aggressive advertising and mortgage financial campaign called the great northwest home rush designed to promote the sale of newly constructed homes that we had previously financed 
in working with the home builders and their realtors  the campaign included a significant commitment to advertising and marketing as well as attractive loan rates and terms  and resulted in a substantial amount of home sales and new loan originations 
the combined effects of these factors allowed us to originate a total of million of one to four family residential loans for the year ended december  the loan sales noted above  coupled with principal repayments  offset much of the increase from current year origination activity  however  in we had a million increase in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
construction and land lending a significant proportion of our loan portfolio consists of residential construction loans to professional home builders  as well as land loans and loans for the construction of commercial and multifamily real estate 
as home sales slowed in the second half of and the housing market weakened even further in and into  we significantly reduced our origination of new construction and land development loans 
improving home sales in the second half of and restructuring opportunities were sufficient to reduce our portfolio of one to four family construction loans by million compared to the prior year end and by million compared to their peak quarter end balance at june  likewise  land development loans decreased million to million at december   however  a meaningful portion of the decline in land development loans resulted from transfers to real estate owned and charge offs 
we continue to believe that land and land development loans represent the most significant source of risk in our loan portfolio 
at december   construction and land loans totaled million including million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans  or of total loans  compared to billion  or  at december  construction and land development loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease compared to million for the year ended december  the geographic distribution of our construction and land development loans is approximately in the greater puget sound market  in the greater portland  oregon market  and in the greater boise  idaho market  with the remaining distributed in various eastern washington  eastern oregon  and northern idaho markets we serve 
increased delinquencies and defaults in residential construction and land development loans had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for and and at december   of our non performing assets resulted from construction and land development lending 
see asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  although multifamily loan growth was relatively modest 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans comprised of total loans at december   compared to a year earlier  while combined growth for these loan types was million for the year 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase the deposit base 
unfortunately  as economic activity remained slow in the current year  demand for commercial business loans was restrained  resulting in a decrease of million  or for the year 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we routinely make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
generally  in  weather conditions  production levels and market prices were good for most of our agricultural borrowers except for dairy products where excess supply and weak demand put strain on certain dairy operations 
generally  agricultural loan balances have a seasonal pattern and for the year the peak quarter end balance was million  or of the loan portfolio on september  at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts and  although the balances are not currently significant  in we reintroduced credit card lending to our consumer loan products 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years 
this increased effort along with the impact of the acquisitions has allowed non real estate related consumer loans to increase meaningfully despite continuing high levels of prepayments 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in non real estate secured consumer loans  a slight decrease compared to december  in addition  consumer loans secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit  increased by million to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at december  while consumer loans remain a relatively small portion of the loan portfolio  aggregate growth was in and we anticipate increased consumer loan activity in future periods as our branch network and retail customer base continue to grow 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing million of loans for others  compared to million at december  the loan servicing portfolio at december  included million of freddie mac mortgage loans  million of fannie mae mortgage loans and million of loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december    of loan servicing fees  net of million of servicing rights amortization and a valuation adjustment of  was recognized in operations 
for the prior year  net loan servicing fees were million 
the decreased servicing income for the current year primarily reflects an elevated level of loan prepayments resulting in accelerated amortization of mortgage servicing rights as well as an  impairment charge to adjust the carrying value our mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was million   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
for the year ended december   we recorded a valuation adjustment of  msrs generally are adversely affected by current and anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates  however  in the current year msr values were also adversely impacted by the effect of distressed sellers on market prices 
at december  and  msrs were carried at a value  net of amortization  of and million  respectively

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

deposits generally are attracted from within our primary market areas through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
at december   we had billion of deposits  with  or billion  in transaction and savings accounts and  or billion  in time deposits  of which billion had remaining maturities of one year or less 
total deposits increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this includes non interest bearing transaction accounts  which increased by  or million  over the same time period

further  although not included in deposit balances  in we had a decrease of million  or  in retail repurchase agreements  which are customer funds that are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements tied to transaction accounts

at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle at a weighted average rate of  an increase of million compared to a year earlier 
also at december   we had an investment of million in fhlb seattle capital stock

at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million 
retail repurchase agreement balances  which are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements  decreased by million during  partially as a result of decreased use of our cash management services by commercial deposit customers  but largely as certain customers transferred balances into fully insured transaction accounts under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp

asset quality over the past two years as housing markets have continued to weaken in many of our primary service areas  we have experienced significantly increasing delinquencies and non performing assets  primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into the early months of  home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow  causing stress on builders and developers cash flows and their ability to service debt  which is reflected in our increased non performing asset totals 
further  property values generally declined during this period  reducing the value of the collateral securing loans 
in addition  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio are showing some signs of stress and increasing levels of non performing loans as the effects of the recessionary economy are becoming more evident 
as a result  for the years ended december  and  our provision for loan losses was significantly higher than historical levels and our normal expectations 
this higher level of delinquencies and non accruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues and increased loan collection costs 
although our future results will depend on the course of recovery from the current economic recession  home sales improved in the spring and summer months of and we are actively engaged with our borrowers in resolving problem loans 
while property values have continued to decline in most markets  our reserve levels are substantial and  as a result of our impairment analysis and charge off actions  reflect current appraisals and valuation estimates as well as recent regulatory examination results 
non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  at december   from million  or of total assets  at december  slow sales and excess inventory in most housing markets have been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures of construction and land development loans  which  including related real estate owned  represented approximately of our non performing assets at december  as a result of this softness in the housing market  property values  particularly values for residential land and building lots  declined throughout the year ended december  reflecting these value declines  we further increased our allowance for loan losses even though total loans outstanding declined 
while less significant  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio also experienced increased non performing loans as a result of deteriorating economic conditions and we increased the allocated allowance for those portions of our portfolio as well 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of non performing loans  compared to million  or of total loans and of non performing loans at december  we continue to believe our level of non performing loans and assets  while increased  is manageable  and we believe that we have sufficient capital and human resources to manage the collection of our one to four family residential construction and related land loan portfolios and other non performing assets in an orderly fashion 
however  our operating results will continue to be adversely impacted until we are able to significantly reduce the level of our non performing assets 
while non performing assets are geographically disbursed  they are concentrated largely in land and land development loans 
the primary components of the million in non performing assets are million in nonaccrual loans  including million of construction and land development loans  and million in real estate owned reo and other repossessed assets 
the geographic distribution of non performing construction  land and land development loans and related real estate owned included approximately million  or  in the puget sound region  million  or  in the greater portland market area  million  or  in the greater boise market area  million  or  in central oregon  and million  or  in other areas of washington 
loans are reported as restructured when we grant concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that we would not otherwise consider 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the bank will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
if any restructured loan becomes delinquent or other matters call into question the borrower s ability to repay full interest and principal in accordance with the restructured terms  the restructured loan s would be reclassified as non accrual

real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of its cost the unpaid principal balance of the related loan plus foreclosure costs or net realizable value 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
at december   we had million of real estate owned 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had classified loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million that are not on nonaccrual status  with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category

the second largest holding is a mixed use three story office retail commercial property in the greater seattle area with a book value of million

this loss compares to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   which included the preferred dividend and discount accretion only in the fourth quarter 
the results for the year ended december  also included a million non cash  non tax deductible impairment charge for the write off of goodwill 
the net loss for the current year reflects a much higher level of loan loss provisioning than the prior year  as well as a significant contraction in our net interest margin as asset yields have declined sharply over the past two years in response to the federal reserve s monetary policy actions and as a result of increased levels of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
as more fully explained below  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increased provision for losses in the current periods primarily reflects an increase in delinquencies  non performing loans and net charge offs  particularly for loans for the construction of one to four family homes and for acquisition and development of land for residential properties 
the provision and net charge offs in the current year were significantly influenced by declines in the appraised value of residential land and developed building lots 
our operating results for the year ended december  also included an increase in other operating income  which was particularly influenced by a million million after tax net gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value compared to million million after tax net loss for the prior year 
excluding these fair value adjustments  other operating income increased to million for the year compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased gain on the sale of loans from mortgage banking operations 
other operating expenses of million for the year ended december  decreased from million for the prior year  which is primarily reflective of the goodwill impairment charge of million in last year s results 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  other operating expenses increased million year over year as reduced costs for compensation  occupancy  information computer data services  and payment processing activities were more than offset by significantly increased deposit insurance charges as well as costs related to real estate owned and higher professional services and advertising expenditures 
compared to levels a year ago  total assets increased to billion at december   net loans decreased to billion  and deposits increased to billion  while borrowings  including customer sweep accounts retail repurchase agreements and junior subordinated debentures  increased million  or  to million 
the average balance of interest earning assets was billion for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to billion one year earlier 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier  primarily as a result of the decrease in the net interest margin and despite a modest increase in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  declined basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of much lower short term interest rates on earning asset yields  particularly floating and adjustable rate loan yields 
this decline in interest rates was further compounded by the adverse effect of an increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
nonaccruing loans reduced the margin by basis points in the year ended december  compared to a basis point reduction for the prior year 
in addition  the mix of earning assets changed to include fewer loans and more securities and interest bearing deposits  particularly in the second half of as our on balance sheet liquidity increased 
this change in the mix in the very low interest rate environment had a further adverse effect on earning asset yields 
funding costs were also significantly lower  however  deposit costs  particularly during the first half of  were adversely impacted by competitive pressures that became severe in late as a result of the effect of the stress in financial and housing markets on many competing financial institutions 
as a result  average funding costs for the year did not decline quite as rapidly or as much as asset yields decreased 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix and a higher level of nonaccrual loans  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year  while funding costs for the same period decreased by only basis points compared to a year earlier 
as a result  the net interest spread compressed to for the year compared to for the prior year and more than offset the growth in average interest earning assets 
however  it is important to note that by comparison to the first two quarters of the year  net interest income and the net interest margin improved meaningfully in the second half of as rapidly declining interest expense on deposits contributed to significantly lower funding costs and that the trend of lower funding costs accelerated in the final quarter of interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred despite a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  as the growth was more than offset by the basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
the decrease in the yield on earning assets reflects the significant changes in federal reserve monetary policy actions beginning in september and accelerating throughout designed to aggressively lower short term interest rates and to maintain these very low interest rates throughout as a result of these policy actions  bank prime rates  which had averaged for the year ended december   declined by basis points to average for the year ended december  average loans receivable for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year 
however  interest income on loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year from million for the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the basis point decrease in the average yield on loans  along with the million decrease in average loan balances 
the decrease in average loan yields reflects the lower average level of market interest rates in the current year  particularly short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
the decrease in average loan yields also reflects the adverse effect of increased loan delinquencies as well as changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and slower turn over in the construction and land development portfolio which resulted in less recognition of deferred loan fee income 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   while the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was more than offset as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents decreased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier 
the basis point decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio is a reflection of the current lower rate environment as well as change in the mix of those assets  particularly the increase in daily interest bearing deposits  and elimination of the dividend on fhlb stock 
in response to the ongoing turmoil in the credit and mortgage markets and the effect on the market value of certain of its mortgage assets  the fhlb of seattle suspended its dividend indefinitely in the fourth quarter of until its earnings and capital position have adequately improved 
by contrast  dividend income received from our investment in fhlb stock for the year ended december  was  interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  somewhat offset by an million increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the small increase in interest bearing balances reflects modest net deposit growth during the year generally offset by an aggregate similar decrease in total borrowings 
the effect of lower average market rates for the year on the cost of these funds was partially mitigated by deposit pricing characteristics noted below 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits and despite a modest increase in the average balance of deposits 
average deposit balances increased million  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased from a year ago to for the current year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our aggregate cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing have been evident in the decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve pursued policies first to aggressively lower short term interest rates by basis points from september  to december  and more recently to maintain the very low level of interest rates for the year ended december  furthermore  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits was quite intense for certain periods during the past twelve months  as many financial institutions experienced increased liquidity concerns in the deteriorating economic conditions 
nonetheless  we did experience significantly declining deposit costs during  with the trend of lower deposit costs accelerating in the second half of the year 
while we do not anticipate further reductions in market interest rates  we do expect additional declines in deposit costs over the near term as account maturities will present further repricing opportunities and competitive pricing has become more rational in response to modest loan demand in the current economic environment 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances for the year ended december  decreased to  a decrease of basis points compared to the prior year  and was augmented by the million decrease in average fhlb borrowings  resulting in a million decrease in the related interest expense 
the lower average rate for fhlb advances reflects an increase in the amount of lower cost overnight funding as well as the maturity of certain fixed rate advances 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers  secured by certain investment securities  the senior bank notes issued under the tlgp  as well as overnight federal funds borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco and correspondent banks 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of million in customer retail repurchase agreements  million of senior bank notes  and million of federal funds purchased  was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the prior year 
the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by  to million for the year ended december   from million one year earlier  as the increase in the average balance was more than offset by the lower market interest rates 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
repurchase agreements and federal funds borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits  which generally lag current market rates 
the senior bank notes which were issued on march   have a fixed rate of and fixed maturity with a month remaining term to maturity at march  junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had the same average balance of million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments but with a higher average rate of 
generally  the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months based upon the three month libor index 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current quarter reflects the impact of lower short term market interest rates 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies section above and in note of the selected notes to consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
throughout  the provision for loan losses was the most important factor contributing to our disappointing operating results 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves  trends in delinquencies and net charge offs and current economic conditions 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date and that the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable 
while the provision for loan losses was significantly greater in the year ended december  than in the prior year  it was meaningfully less in the second half of the year than in the first half as the pace of net charge offs and problem loan identification moderated as the year progressed 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  continued to primarily reflect material levels of delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and additional declines in property values 
it also reflects our concerns that the significant number of distressed sellers and lender foreclosures may further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these concerns heightened during the second half of and remained elevated in the current year as additional evidence of price declines for certain housing and related lot and land markets became more apparent 
this was particularly the case in certain areas of the puget sound and portland regions where a significant portion of our construction and development loans are located 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans generally reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  the weak pace of general economic activity has also become a significant contributing factor 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans increased by million during the year to million at december   compared to million at december   a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and reflects an increase of million  or  to million at december   from million at december  similarly  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses increased to at december   compared to at december  likewise the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier  and more of the non performing loan balances have been reduced to expected recovery values as a result of specific impairment analysis and related charge offs 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans  including million of restructured loans which are currently performing under their restructured terms 
of those impaired loans  million have no allowances for credit losses as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds their carrying costs  which in some cases is net of substantial write offs 
the remaining million have related allowances for credit losses totaling million 
impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that have been individually evaluated for reserve needs totaled million and accounted for million of the allowances for impaired loans at december  also  at december   impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that are collectively evaluated as homogeneous pools totaled million and accounted for million of the total allowance related to impaired loans 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands table changes in allowance for loan losses years ended december balance  beginning of period allowances added through business combinations provision recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer loans charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer net charge offs balance  end of period allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans net loan charge offs as a percent of average outstanding loans during the period allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans specific or allocated loss allowances commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer estimated allowance for undisbursed commitments  n a  n a n a n a n a unallocated n a n a n a n a n a total allowance for loan losses we establish specific loss allowances when individual loans are identified that present a possibility of loss ie  that full collectibility is not reasonably assured 
the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income  which includes changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value as well as non interest revenues from core operations  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
excluding the fair value adjustments  other operating income from core operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of increased mortgage banking activity 
while the pace of mortgage banking activity moderated in the final quarter  for the year it was strong and  as a result  gain on sale of loans increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  by contrast  reflecting accelerated amortization due to early loan payoffs as well as  of msr impairment charges  servicing fees decreased by million compared to a year earlier 
the slower pace of economic activity adversely affected our payment processing revenues in both years as activity levels for deposit customers  cardholders and merchants remained subdued 
primarily reflecting this slow down in customer transaction volumes  income from deposit fees and other service charges decreased by  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  despite growth in our account base 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net gain of million for the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  the fair value adjustments in both years primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in a large gain  partially offset by reductions in the values of the trust preferred securities which we own  including collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities  and in by the write down of fannie mae and freddie mac equity securities 
as discussed more thoroughly in note of the selected notes to the consolidated financial statements  the valuation of these financial instruments has become very difficult and more subjective in recent periods as current and reliable observable transaction data does not exist 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million  including the million goodwill impairment charge in excluding the goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december   other operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
the current year s expenses reflect significantly higher deposit insurance expense  elevated costs associated with problem loan collection activities including charges related to real estate owned  and increased advertising  generally offset by reductions in compensation  occupancy costs and payment and card processing expenses 
as a result  other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets was for the year ended december   compared to excluding goodwill impairment one year earlier 
salary and employee benefits decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting reduced staffing levels as well as the elimination of certain incentive accruals and reductions in the level of employer paid retirement contributions 
likewise  occupancy costs decreased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million one year ago as we continued to achieve additional operating efficiencies in this important area following the successful integration of the acquisitions 
the current year s operating expenses also included million for payment and card processing services  which was a decrease of  compared to the year ended december   largely as a result of lower activity levels 
by contrast  the cost of fdic insurance increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting increased assessment rates and incremental charges for certain deposits in excess of  as well as a special assessment of million collected in june advertising and marketing expenditures increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of a number of targeted deposit acquisition campaigns and costs associated with our great northwest home rush program 
additionally  expenses related to real estate owned  including losses on sales and valuation adjustments  increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively  in each case reflecting a tax benefit rather than a tax expense 
in both years the effective tax rate reflects the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments combined with the tax benefits of tax exempt income from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance policies 
the impact of those tax credits and tax exempt income  combined with a taxable loss in the current year  results in an effective tax rate that is somewhat higher than the expected statutory rate 
by contrast  the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects the effect of the goodwill write off  which was a non deductible expense for tax purposes and significantly reduced the otherwise expected tax benefit of the before tax book loss 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year reflected material increases in our provision for loan losses as well as a significant decline in our net interest margin  which more than offset the favorable effects of continued growth of loans and deposits  as well as changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
results for were also adversely affected by a million non cash impairment charge to eliminate the carrying value of goodwill 
our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in the provision for loan losses during primarily reflected an increase in delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and our concerns that the increasing number of distressed sellers and lender foreclosures could further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these trends became more apparent as the year progressed  particularly in the puget sound region which had previously shown fewer signs of stress 
our operating results for the year ended december   also included an increase in other operating income  particularly deposit fees and service charges as a result of the increase in our deposit customer base and related payment processing activities 
other operating expenses for the year increased substantially compared to the prior year 
the increase was predominantly due to the write off of million of goodwill 
the increased expense was also representative of a full year s effect of the acquisitions and various new branches  as well as substantially increased deposit insurance and collection and legal costs 
over the twenty four month period  through acquisitions and de novo operations we added new branches to improve and expand our franchise  impacting both revenues and expenses 
further  our operating results for the year ended december  included a million million after tax net gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a million million after tax gain for the prior year 
the fair value adjustment for primarily reflected changes in the valuation of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures  both owned and issued by the company  and the reduction in fair value of our investment in fannie mae and freddie mac equity securities 
excluding the net fair value adjustments and goodwill write off  the net loss from core operations was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the decrease in the net interest margin as discussed below and despite the million  or  growth in average interest earning assets compared to the prior year 
the average balance of interest earning assets was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the prior year 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  declined basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of rapidly declining short term interest rates on earning asset yields  particularly floating and adjustable rate loan yields 
by comparison to the prior year  this decline was compounded by the adverse effect of a large increase in the level of non accrual loans and other non performing assets 
while funding costs were also significantly lower  the more immediate impact of lower market rates on a substantial portion of our loan portfolio resulted in compression of our net interest margin and more than offset benefits from loan and deposit growth 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix and a higher level of non accrual loans  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year  while funding costs for the same period decreased by only basis points 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred despite a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  as the growth was more than offset by the decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the yield on earning assets reflects the significant changes in federal reserve policy actions beginning in september designed to aggressively lower short term interest rates 
as a result of those policy actions  bank prime rates  which had averaged for the year ended december   declined by basis points to average for the year ended december  the prime rate ended the year at  and this change placed further downward pressure on loan yields in average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year ended december  interest income on loans for the year decreased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the basis point decrease in the average yield on loans  which was partially offset by the increase in average loan balances 
the decrease in average loan yields reflects the lower average level of market interest rates in  following the federal reserve s actions to lower those rates  particularly short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
the decrease in average loan yields also reflects changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and slower turn over in the construction and land development portfolio which resulted in less recognition of deferred loan fee income  as well as the adverse effect of increased loan delinquencies 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million  excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   and the interest and dividend income from those investments increased by million compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was somewhat enhanced as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents increased slightly to for the year ended december   from in the prior year 
the four basis point increase in the yield of the securities portfolio is a reflection of a change in the mix of those assets 
also  while not particularly significant in amount  we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the prior year 
however  in response to the ongoing turmoil in the credit and mortgage markets and the effect on the market value of certain of its mortgage assets  the fhlb of seattle suspended its dividend indefinitely in the fourth quarter of interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable period in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  and despite a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest bearing balances reflects a million increase in average deposits  including growth due to our acquisitions  along with a million increase  excluding the effect of fair value adjustments in average fhlb advances 
the average balances for junior subordinated debentures excluding the effect of fair value adjustments and other borrowings also increased by million compared to a year ago 
the effect of lower average market rates for the year on the cost of these funds was partially mitigated by deposit pricing characteristics noted below and by changes in the mix of deposits 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits and despite the significant deposit growth during reflecting the acquisitions  branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased from a year ago to for the year ended december  deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing was evident in the relatively modest decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve moved aggressively to lower short term interest rates by basis points from september  to december  average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier 
while the average rate paid on fhlb advances for the year ended december  decreased to  a decrease of basis points compared to the prior year  the million increase in average fhlb borrowings resulted in a million increase in the related interest expense 
junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had an average balance of million with a higher average rate of 
generally  the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in reflected lower short term market interest rates  as well as a lower spread on the most recently issued debentures and the early redemption of a higher costing tranche of debentures 
effective april   we exercised the early redemption provision with respect to approximately million of the junior subordinated debentures which had a spread of to six month libor and an average cost of during the six months preceding redemption 
we replaced the redeemed debentures with a new million tranche of junior subordinated debentures issued on july  with an initial rate of and a repricing spread of to three month libor 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers  wholesale repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities as well as overnight federal funds borrowings from the frbsf and correspondent banks 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of million in customer retail repurchase agreements and million of fed funds  was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the prior year 
the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by  to million from million for the respective periods  again reflecting significantly lower market interest rates 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
other borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits  which generally lag current market rates  although  similar to deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements have a lower degree of volatility than most market rates 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million for the prior year 
for  the provision for loan losses was the most important factor contributing to our disappointing core operating results 
the significantly greater provision for loan losses for the year ended december  primarily reflected the substantial increase in delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and our concerns that the increasing number of distressed sellers and lender foreclosures could further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
in particular  the increased provision for loan losses reflected our concern that higher levels of delinquencies and loan loss provisioning recently announced by a number of lenders in our markets could lead to significant additional discounting of property values in efforts to expedite problem loan resolutions 
these concerns heightened during the second half of the year as evidence of over supply and price declines for certain housing and related lot and land markets became more apparent 
this was particularly the case in certain outlying areas of the puget sound and portland regions  which had previously demonstrated fewer signs of stress than some of the other markets that we serve 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans generally reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  as the year progressed the deteriorating pace of economic activity became a more significant contributing factor 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses increased to at december   compared to at december  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans 
of those impaired loans  million had related allowances for credit losses totaling million 
the remaining million in impaired loans had no allowances for credit losses as their estimated collateral value was equal to or exceeded their carrying costs 
impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that were individually evaluated for reserve needs totaled million and accounted for million of the allowances for impaired loans 
impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that were collectively evaluated as homogeneous pools totaled million and accounted for million of the total allowance related to impaired loans 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  significantly influenced by the increase in deposit balances from our acquisitions  yet also reflecting internally generated growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services 
changes in certain pricing schedules and interchange fees also contributed to the increased fee income 
while deposit fees exhibited solid growth for the full year  the slowing economy did adversely affect our payment processing revenues beginning particularly in the late summer  as activity levels for deposit customers  cardholders and merchants clearly declined compared to earlier in the year and compared to the prior year 
loan servicing fees also increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
reflecting decreased mortgage banking activity  gain on sale of loans decreased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year 
gain on sale of loans for included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
by comparison  in the year ended december   gain on sale of loans included  of fees on million of brokered loans 
for the years ended december  and  other income also included net gains of million and million  respectively  for the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value 
the fair value adjustments in both years primarily reflected changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in a large gain  partially offset by reductions in the values of the trust preferred securities  including collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities  and fannie mae and freddie mac equity securities which we own 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the write off of million of goodwill accounted for of the increase 
the remaining million increase was primarily a result of the recent bank acquisitions and branch expansion evidenced by the increase in compensation  occupancy and miscellaneous expenses as locations  staffing and the volume of activity have expanded 
in  management became keenly focused on expense discipline and we began to experience much of the anticipated efficiencies following the prior year s acquisitions 
however  the expected improvement was significantly offset by increased fdic deposit insurance expense and higher loan collection costs as a result of increased delinquencies 
the cost of fdic insurance increased million from the previous year 
we also incurred million of costs in connection with operating expenses and valuation adjustments for reo and other repossessed assets  an increase of million in comparison with the prior year 
besides the effect of our three bank acquisitions in  the expenses for included operating costs associated with the opening of two new branch offices in in portland  oregon  and bellevue  washington  and ten branches at various times during primarily reflecting these additions  occupancy costs increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
direct expenses associated with payment and card processing services increased by million as a result of growth in these fee generating activities  largely reflecting growth in the account base 
operating expenses for also included million for amortization of the core deposit intangibles recorded in connection with three acquisitions  which was an increase of  compared to the year ended december  while we continued our strong commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  marketing and advertising costs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets were excluding the goodwill write off for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year  reflecting the increased expenses noted above 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in reflects the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments combined with the tax benefits of tax exempt income from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance policies 
the effective tax rate in reflects the previously mentioned tax credits and tax exempt income combined with relatively modest amounts of taxable income and the significant effect of the goodwill write off which was a non deductible expense for tax purposes

market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets  although our floating rate assets tend to be more immediately responsive to changes in market rates than most funding deposit liabilities 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on a portion of our floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  in a declining interest rate environment  as loans with floors are repaid they generally are replaced with new loans which have lower interest rate floors 
further  many of the floating rate loans with interest rate floors are in portions of the portfolio currently experiencing higher levels of delinquencies  which tends to mitigate the beneficial effect of the floors 
as of december   our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately billion and had a weighted average floor rate of 
an additional consideration is the lagging and somewhat inelastic pricing adjustments for interest rates on certain deposit products as market interest rates change 
these deposit pricing characteristics are particularly relevant to the administered rates paid on certain checking  savings and money market accounts and contributed to the narrowing of our net interest margin following the federal reserve s actions to lower market interest rates beginning in late and accelerating in  as asset yields declined while the reduction in deposit costs lagged 
further  deposit costs have not declined as much as other short term market interest rates as credit concerns and liquidity issues for certain large financial institutions  particularly in the summer and fall of  created heightened competitive pricing pressures 
fortunately  these competitive pressures have decreased over recent quarters and deposit costs have declined sharply over the same period 
as previously noted  our net interest margin has also been adversely affected by an increase in loan delinquencies as well as changes in the portfolio mix as construction and development lending has slowed 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize economic value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net economic value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net economic value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net economic value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net economic value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
tables and a  interest rate risk indicators  set forth as of december  and  the estimated changes in our net interest income over a one year time horizon and the estimated changes in economic value of equity based on the indicated interest rate environments 
table interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity table a interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities 
another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe change in market rates 
tables and a  interest sensitivity gap  present our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown

management is aware of the sources of interest rate risk and in its opinion actively monitors and manages it to the extent possible

although regular savings  demand  now  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities 
if all of these accounts had been assumed to be short term  the one year cumulative gap of interest sensitive assets would have been million  or of total assets at december   and million  or  at december  interest bearing liabilities for this table exclude certain non interest bearing deposits that are included in the average balance calculations reflected in table  analysis of net interest spread 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million  million and million  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities  sales of loans  and deposit growth 
during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million and million  respectively  of loans 
net deposit growth was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with million of the growth coming from acquisitions 
the increase in deposits in the current year occurred despite the runoff of million in public funds in response to changes in the collateralization requirements under the washington and oregon state public deposit protection regulations 
in addition to reducing our collateral requirements  allowing those deposits to run off also reduced our exposure to future shared risk assessments under those regulations 
deposit activity for the year ended december  also included a net decrease of million of brokered deposits 
deposit activity in included net increases of million and million of brokered deposits and public funds  respectively 
brokered deposits and public funds are generally more price sensitive than retail deposits and our use of those deposits varies significantly based upon our liquidity management strategies at any point in time 
fhlb advances excluding fair value adjustments increased million for the year ended december  and decreased million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other borrowings  including the million of senior bank notes issued under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  increased million for the year ended december  excluding fair value adjustments  our junior subordinated debentures were unchanged for the year ended december  while they increased million for the year ended december  and decreased million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we also received million when we issued senior preferred stock to the us treasury through its capital purchase program 
we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  purchase securities  add to our short term liquidity position and pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
in we also used approximately million to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and acquisition costs of our three acquisitions 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling million  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling million 
while reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances and frbsf borrowings 
we maintain credit facilities with the fhlb seattle  which at december  provide for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of billion  and of islanders bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million 
advances under these credit facilities totaled million  or of our assets at december  in addition  banner bank has been approved for participation in the federal reserve bank of san francisco s borrower in custody bic program 
under this program we can borrow up to of eligible loans not already pledged for other borrowings  which we currently estimate would provide additional borrowing capacity of million 
we utilized this facility on a limited basis during  however  we had no funds borrowed from the federal reserve bank at december  at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including billion which were scheduled to mature within one year 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our deposits as they mature 
management believes it has adequate resources and funding potential to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements

the capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require banner corporation and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital 
the federal reserve requires banner corporation to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the fdic requirements 
the fdic requires the banks to maintain minimum ratios of tier total capital to risk weighted assets as well as tier leverage capital to average assets

the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
