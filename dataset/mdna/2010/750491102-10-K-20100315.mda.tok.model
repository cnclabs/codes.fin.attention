additional information concerning radnet  inc  including our consolidated subsidiaries  for each of the years ended december   december  and december  is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this annual report 
history of our business we were originally incorporated in the state of new york in and have been continuously engaged in the medical imaging business since that time 
on november   we completed the acquisition of radiologix  inc radiologix  a delaware corporation  then employing approximately  people  through its subsidiaries  was a national provider of diagnostic imaging services through the ownership and operation of freestanding  outpatient diagnostic imaging centers 
radiologix owned  operated and maintained equipment in locations  with imaging centers in seven states  including primary operations in the mid atlantic  the bay area  california  the treasure coast area  florida  northeast kansas  and the finger lakes rochester and hudson valley areas of new york state 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  radiologix stockholders received aggregate consideration of  shares after giving effect to the one for two reverse stock split effected in november of our common stock and  in cash 
we financed the transaction and refinanced substantially all of our outstanding debt with a million senior secured credit facility with ge commercial healthcare financial services 
since that time we have continued to develop our medical imaging business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions

industry overview diagnostic imaging involves the use of non invasive procedures to generate representations of internal anatomy and function that can be recorded on film or digitized for display on a video monitor 
diagnostic imaging procedures facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures  often minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients 
diagnostic imaging procedures include mri  ct  pet  nuclear medicine  ultrasound  mammography  x ray and fluoroscopy 
we estimate that the national imaging market in the united states is billion  with projected mid single digit growth for mri  ct and pet ct driven by the aging of the us population  wider physician and payor acceptance for imaging technologies  and greater consumer and physician awareness of diagnostic screening capabilities 
while general x ray remains the most commonly performed diagnostic imaging procedure  the fastest growing and higher margin procedures are mri  ct and pet 
the rapid growth in pet scans is attributable to the increasing recognition of the efficacy of pet scans in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer 
the number of mri and ct scans continues to grow due to their wider acceptance by physicians and payors  an increasing number of applications for their use and a general increase in demand due to the aging population in the united states 
industry trends we believe the diagnostic imaging services industry will continue to grow as a result of a number of factors  including the following escalating demand for healthcare services from an aging population persons over the age of comprise one of the fastest growing segments of the population in the united states 
according to the united states census bureau  this group is expected to increase as much as from to because diagnostic imaging use tends to increase as a person ages  we believe the aging population will generate more demand for diagnostic imaging procedures 
new effective applications for diagnostic imaging technology new technological developments are expected to extend the clinical uses of diagnostic imaging technology and increase the number of scans performed 
recent technological advancements include mri spectroscopy  which can differentiate malignant from benign lesions  mri angiography  which can produce three dimensional images of body parts and assess the status of blood vessels  enhancements in teleradiology systems  which permit the digital transmission of radiological images from one location to another for interpretation by radiologists at remote locations  and the development of combined pet ct scanners  which combine the technology from pet and ct to create a powerful diagnostic imaging system 
additional improvements in imaging technologies  contrast agents and scan capabilities are leading to new non invasive methods of diagnosing blockages in the heart s vital coronary arteries  liver metastases  pelvic diseases and vascular abnormalities without exploratory surgery 
we believe that the use of the diagnostic capabilities of mri and other imaging services will continue to increase because they are cost effective  time efficient and non invasive  as compared to alternative procedures  including surgery  and that newer technologies and future technological advancements will further increase the use of imaging services 
at the same time  the industry has increasingly used upgrades to existing equipment to expand applications  extend the useful life of existing equipment  improve image quality  reduce image acquisition time and increase the volume of scans that can be performed 
we believe this trend toward equipment upgrades rather than equipment replacements will continue  as we do not foresee new imaging technologies on the near term horizon that will displace mri  ct or pet as the principal advanced diagnostic imaging modalities 
wider physician and payor acceptance of the use of imaging during the last years  there has been a major effort undertaken by the medical and scientific communities to develop higher quality  cost effective diagnostic imaging technologies and to minimize the risks associated with the application of these technologies 
the thrust of product development during this period has largely been to reduce the hazards associated with conventional x ray and nuclear medicine techniques and to develop new  harmless imaging technologies 
as a result  the use of advanced diagnostic imaging modalities  such as mri  ct and pet  which provide superior image quality compared to other diagnostic imaging technologies  has increased rapidly in recent years 
these advanced modalities allow physicians to diagnose a wide variety of diseases and injuries quickly and accurately without exploratory surgery or other surgical or invasive procedures  which are usually more expensive  involve greater risk to patients and result in longer rehabilitation time 
because advanced imaging systems are increasingly seen as a tool for reducing long term healthcare costs  they are gaining wider acceptance among payors 
greater consumer awareness of and demand for preventive diagnostic screening diagnostic imaging  such as elective full body scans  is increasingly being used as a screening tool for preventive care procedures 
consumer awareness of diagnostic imaging as a less invasive and preventive screening method has added to the growth in diagnostic imaging procedures 
we believe that further technological advancements allowing for early diagnosis of diseases and disorders using less invasive procedures will create additional demand for diagnostic imaging 
diagnostic imaging settings diagnostic imaging services are typically provided in one of the following settings fixed site  freestanding outpatient diagnostic facilities these facilities range from single modality to multi modality facilities and are generally not owned by hospitals or clinics 
these facilities depend upon physician referrals for their patients and generally do not maintain dedicated  contractual relationships with hospitals or clinics 
in fact  these facilities may compete with hospitals or clinics that have their own imaging systems to provide services to these patients 
these facilities bill third party payors  such as managed care organizations  insurance companies  medicare or medicaid 
all of our facilities are in this category 
hospitals many hospitals provide both inpatient and outpatient diagnostic imaging services  typically on site 
these inpatient and outpatient centers are owned and operated by the hospital or clinic  or jointly by both  and are primarily used by patients of the hospital or clinic 
the hospital or clinic bills third party payors  such as managed care organizations  insurance companies  medicare or medicaid 
while many hospitals own or lease their own equipment  certain hospitals provide these services by contracting with providers of mobile imaging equipment 
using specially designed trailers  mobile imaging service providers transport imaging equipment and provide services to hospitals and clinics on a part time or full time basis  thus allowing small to mid size hospitals and clinics that do not have the patient demand to justify fixed on site access to advanced diagnostic imaging technology 
diagnostic imaging providers contract directly with the hospital or clinic and are typically reimbursed directly by them 
diagnostic imaging modalities the principal diagnostic imaging modalities we use at our facilities are mri mri has become widely accepted as the standard diagnostic tool for a wide and fast growing variety of clinical applications for soft tissue anatomy  such as those found in the brain  spinal cord and interior ligaments of body joints such as the knee 
mri uses a strong magnetic field in conjunction with low energy electromagnetic waves that are processed by a computer to produce high resolution  three dimensional  cross sectional images of body tissue  including the brain  spine  abdomen  heart and extremities 
a typical mri examination takes from to minutes 
mri systems can have either open or closed designs  routinely have magnetic field strength of tesla to tesla and are priced in the range of million to million 
as of december   we had mri systems in operation 
ct ct provides higher resolution images than conventional x rays  but generally not as well defined as those produced by mri 
ct uses a computer to direct the movement of an x ray tube to produce multiple cross sectional images of a particular organ or area of the body 
ct is used to detect tumors and other conditions affecting bones and internal organs 
it is also used to detect the occurrence of strokes  hemorrhages and infections 
a typical ct examination takes from to minutes 
ct systems are priced in the range of million to million 
as of december   we had ct systems in operation 
pet pet scanning involves the administration of a radiopharmaceutical agent with a positron emitting isotope and the measurement of the distribution of that isotope to create images for diagnostic purposes 
pet scans provide the capability to determine how metabolic activity impacts other aspects of physiology in the disease process by correlating the reading for the pet with other tools such as ct or mri 
pet technology has been found highly effective and appropriate in certain clinical circumstances for the detection and assessment of tumors throughout the body  the evaluation of some cardiac conditions and the assessment of epilepsy seizure sites 
the information provided by pet technology often obviates the need to perform further highly invasive or diagnostic surgical procedures 
pet systems are priced in the range of million to million 
in addition  we employ combined pet ct systems that blend the pet and ct imaging modalities into one scanner 
these combined systems are priced in the range of million to million 
as of december   we had pet or combination pet ct systems in operation 
nuclear medicine nuclear medicine uses short lived radioactive isotopes that release small amounts of radiation that can be recorded by a gamma camera and processed by a computer to produce an image of various anatomical structures or to assess the function of various organs such as the heart  kidneys  thyroid and bones 
nuclear medicine is used primarily to study anatomic and metabolic functions 
nuclear medicine systems are priced in the range of  to  as of december   we had nuclear medicine systems in operation 
x ray x rays use roentgen rays to penetrate the body and record images of organs and structures on film 
digital x ray systems add computer image processing capability to traditional x ray images  which provides faster transmission of images with a higher resolution and the capability to store images more cost effectively 
x ray systems are priced in the range of  to  as of december   we had x ray systems in operation 
ultrasound ultrasound imaging uses sound waves and their echoes to visualize and locate internal organs 
it is particularly useful in viewing soft tissues that do not x ray well 
ultrasound is used in pregnancy to avoid x ray exposure as well as in gynecological  urologic  vascular  cardiac and breast applications 
ultrasound systems are priced in the range of  to  as of december   we had ultrasound systems in operation 
mammography mammography is a specialized form of radiology using low dosage x rays to visualize breast tissue and is the primary screening tool for breast cancer 
mammography procedures and related services assist in the diagnosis of and treatment planning for breast cancer 
analog mammography systems are priced in the range of  to  and digital mammography systems are priced in the range of  to  as of december   we had mammography systems in operation  of which are digital mammography systems 
during the last two years we converted of our analog mammography systems to digital mammography systems 
fluoroscopy fluoroscopy uses ionizing radiation combined with a video viewing system for real time monitoring of organs 
fluoroscopy systems are priced in the range of  to  as of december   we had fluoroscopy systems in operation 
our competitive strengths our position as the largest provider of freestanding  fixed site outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the united states  based on number of centers and revenue as of december   we operated centers in california  delaware  maryland  new jersey  florida  kansas and new york 
our size and scale allow us to achieve operating  sourcing and administrative efficiencies  including equipment and medical supply sourcing savings and favorable maintenance contracts from equipment manufacturers and other suppliers 
our specific knowledge of our geographic markets drives strong relationships with key payors  radiology groups and referring physicians within our markets 
our comprehensive multi modality diagnostic imaging offering the vast majority of our centers offer multi modality procedures  driving strong relationships with referring physicians and payors in our markets and a diversified revenue base 
at each of our multi modality facilities  we offer patients and referring physicians one location to serve their needs for multiple procedures 
furthermore  we have complemented many of our multi modality sites with single modality sites to accommodate overflow and to provide a full range of services within a local area consistent with demand 
this prevents multiple patient visits or unnecessary travel between facilities  thereby increasing patient throughput and decreasing costs and time delays 
our revenue is generated by a broad mix of modalities 
we believe our multi modality strategy lessens our exposure to reimbursement changes in any specific modality 
our facility density in many highly populated areas of the united states the strategic organization of our diagnostic imaging facilities into regional networks densely concentrated around major population centers in seven states offers unique benefits to our patients  our referring physicians  our payors and us 
we are able to increase the convenience of our services to patients by implementing scheduling systems within geographic regions  where practical 
for example  many of our diagnostic imaging facilities within a particular region can access the patient appointment calendars of other facilities within the same regional network to efficiently allocate time available and to meet a patient s appointment  date  time or location preferences 
the grouping of our facilities within regional networks enables us to easily move technologists and other personnel  as well as equipment  from under utilized to over utilized facilities on an as needed basis  and drive referrals 
our organization of referral networks results in increased patient throughput  greater operating efficiencies and better equipment utilization rates and improved response time for our patients 
we believe our networks of facilities and tailored service offerings for geographic areas drives local physician referrals  makes us an attractive candidate for selection as a preferred provider by third party payors  creates economies of scale and provides barriers to entry by competitors in our markets 
our strong relationships with payors and diversified payor mix our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of payors  including private payors  managed care capitated payors and government payors  which should mitigate our exposure to possible unfavorable reimbursement trends within any one payor class 
in addition  our experience with capitation arrangements over the last several years has provided us with the expertise to manage utilization and pricing effectively  resulting in a predictable and recurring stream of revenue 
we believe that third party payors representing large groups of patients often prefer to enter into managed care contracts with providers that offer a broad array of diagnostic imaging services at convenient locations throughout a geographic area 
as of december   we received approximately of our payments from commercial insurance payors  from managed care capitated payors  from medicare and from medicaid 
with the exception of blue cross blue shield  which are managed by different entities in each of the states in which we operate  and medicare  no single payor accounted for more than of our net revenue for the twelve months ended december  our strong relationships with experienced and highly regarded radiologists our contracted radiologists have outstanding credentials  strong relationships with referring physicians  and a broad mix of sub specialties 
the collective experience and expertise of these radiologists translates into more accurate and efficient service to patients 
our close relationship with dr 
berger  our president and chief executive officer  and brmg in california and our long term arrangements with radiologists outside of california enable us to better ensure that medical service provided at our facilities is consistent with the needs and expectations of our referring physicians  patients and payors 
our experienced and committed management team our senior management group has more than years of combined healthcare management experience 
our executive management team has created our differentiated approach based on their comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging industry and the dynamics of our regional markets 
we have a track record of successful acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses into radnet  and have managed the business through a variety of economic and reimbursement cycles 
our management beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
our technologically advanced imaging systems we have invested significant capital in our imaging systems over the last three years 
our state of the art imaging systems can perform high quality scans more rapidly and can be used for a wider variety of imaging applications than less advanced systems 
while general x ray remains the most commonly performed diagnostic imaging procedure  the fastest growing and higher margin procedures are mri  ct and pet 
because technological change in diagnostic imaging is gradual  most of our systems can be upgraded with software or hardware enhancements  which should allow us to continue to provide advanced technology without significant capital expenditure to replace an entire system 
in recent years  we have made significant investments in upgrading our facilities to digital imaging technology  inclusive of x ray and mammography  and believe our advanced imaging systems will drive increased applications and higher patient through put 
business strategy maximize performance at our existing facilities we intend to enhance our operations and increase scan volume and revenue at our existing facilities by expanding physician relationships and increasing the procedure offerings 
focus on profitable contracting we regularly evaluate our contracts with third party payors  industry vendors and radiology groups  as well as our equipment and real property leases  to determine how we may improve the terms to increase our revenues and reduce our expenses 
because many of our contracts with third party payors are short term in nature  we can regularly renegotiate these contracts  if necessary 
we believe our position as a leading provider of diagnostic imaging services and our long term relationships with physician groups in our markets enable us to obtain more favorable contract terms than would be available to smaller or less experienced imaging services providers 
expand mri  ct and pet applications we intend to continue to use expanding mri  ct and pet applications as they become commercially available 
most of these applications can be performed by our existing mri  ct and pet systems with upgrades to software and hardware  thereby minimizing capital expenditure requirements 
we intend to introduce applications that will decrease scan and image reading time to increase our productivity 
optimize operating efficiencies we intend to maximize our equipment utilization by adding  upgrading and re deploying equipment where we experience excess demand 
we will continue to trim excess operating and general and administrative costs where it is feasible to do so  including consolidating  divesting or closing under performing facilities to reduce operating costs and improve operating income 
we also may continue to use  where appropriate  highly trained radiology physician assistants to perform  under appropriate supervision of radiologists  basic services traditionally performed by radiologists 
we will continue to upgrade our advanced information technology system to create cost reductions for our facilities in areas such as image storage  support personnel and financial management 
expand our networks we intend to continue to expand the number of our facilities through new developments and targeted acquisitions  using a disciplined approach for evaluating and entering new areas  including consideration of whether we have adequate financial resources to expand 
our current plans are to strengthen our market presence in geographic areas where we currently have existing operations and to expand into neighboring and other areas which we determine to be appropriate 
we perform extensive due diligence before developing a new facility or acquiring an existing facility  including surveying local referral sources and radiologists  as well as examining the demographics  reimbursement environment  competitive landscape and intrinsic demand of the geographic market 
we generally will only enter new markets where there is sufficient patient demand for outpatient diagnostic imaging services  we believe we can gain significant market share  we can build key referral relationships or we have already established such relationships  and payors are receptive to our entry into the market 
our services we offer a comprehensive set of imaging services including mri  ct  pet  nuclear medicine  x ray  ultrasound  mammography  fluoroscopy and other related procedures 
in our centers we focus on providing standardized high quality imaging services  regardless of location  to ensure patients  physicians and payors consistency in service and quality 
to ensure the high quality of our services  we monitor patient satisfaction  timeliness of services to patients and reports to physicians 
based on our conversations with payors  in our experience  our fees are generally lower than hospital fees for the services we provide 
the key features of our services include patient friendly  non clinical environments  a hour turnaround on routine examinations  interpretations within one to two hours  if needed  flexible patient scheduling  including same day appointments  extended operating hours  including weekends  reports delivered by courier  facsimile or email  availability of second opinions and consultations  availability of sub specialty interpretations at no additional charge  and standardized fee schedules by region 
radiology professionals in the states in which we provide services except florida  a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or similar professional organization is not allowed to practice medicine  including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice 
this doctrine is commonly referred to as the prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine 
in order to comply with this prohibition  we contract with radiologists to provide professional medical services in our facilities  including the supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures 
the radiology practice maintains full control over the physicians it employs 
pursuant to each management contract  we make available the imaging facility and all of the furniture and medical equipment at the facility for use by the radiology practice  and the practice is responsible for staffing the facility with qualified professional medical personnel 
in addition  we provide management services and administration of the non medical functions relating to the professional medical practice at the facility  including among other functions  provision of clerical and administrative personnel  bookkeeping and accounting services  billing and collection  provision of medical and office supplies  secretarial  reception and transcription services  maintenance of medical records  and advertising  marketing and promotional activities 
as compensation for the services furnished under contracts with radiologists  we generally receive an agreed percentage of the medical practice billings for  or collections from  services provided at the facility  typically varying between to of global net revenue or collections after deduction of the professional fees 
at all but of our california facilities we contract  directly or through brmg  with other radiology groups to provide professional medical services 
at our imaging facilities we charge a fee for our services as manager of the entity which owns the center 
many states have also enacted laws prohibiting a licensed professional from splitting fees derived from the practice of medicine with an unlicensed person or business entity 
we do not believe that the management  administrative  technical and other non medical services we provide to each of our contracted radiology groups violate the corporate practice of medicine prohibition or that the fees we charge for such services violate the fee splitting prohibition 
however  the enforcement and interpretation of these laws by regulatory authorities and state courts vary from state to state 
if our arrangements with our independent contractor radiology groups are found to violate state laws prohibiting the practice of medicine by general business corporations or fee splitting  our business  financial condition and ability to operate in those states could be adversely affected 
brmg in california howard g 
berger  md  is our president and chief executive officer  a member of our board of directors and owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
dr 
berger also owns  indirectly  of the equity interests in brmg 
brmg provides all of the professional medical services at of our facilities located in california under a management agreement with us  and contracts with various other independent physicians and physician groups to provide the professional medical services at most of our other california facilities 
we obtain professional medical services from brmg in california  rather than provide such services directly or through subsidiaries  in order to comply with california s prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine 
however  as a result of our close relationship with dr 
berger and brmg  we believe that we are able to better ensure that medical service is provided at our california facilities in a manner consistent with our needs and expectations and those of our referring physicians  patients and payors than if we obtained these services from unaffiliated physician groups 
we believe that physicians are drawn to brmg and the other radiologist groups with whom we contract by the opportunity to work with the state of the art equipment we make available to them  as well as the opportunity to receive specialized training through our fellowship programs  and engage in clinical research programs  which generally are available only in university settings and major hospitals 
as of december   brmg employed full time and nine part time radiologists 
under our management agreement with brmg  we are paid a percentage of the amounts collected for the professional services brmg physicians render as compensation for our services and for the use of our facilities and equipment 
for the year ended december   this percentage was 
the percentage may be adjusted  if necessary  to ensure that the parties receive the fair value for the services they render 
the following are the other principal terms of our management agreement with brmg the agreement expires on january  however  the agreement automatically renews for consecutive year periods  unless either party delivers a notice of non renewal to the other party no later than six months prior to the scheduled expiration date 
either party may terminate the agreement if the other party defaults under its obligations  after notice and an opportunity to cure 
we may terminate the agreement if dr 
berger no longer owns at least of the equity of brmg  as of december   he owned of the equity of brmg 
at its expense  brmg employs or contracts with an adequate number of physicians necessary to provide all professional medical services at all of our california facilities  except for facilities for which we contract with separate medical groups 
at our expense  we provide all furniture  furnishings and medical equipment located at the facilities and we manage and administer all non medical functions at  and provide all nurses and other non physician personnel required for the operation of  the facilities 
if brmg wants to open a new facility  we have the right of first refusal to provide the space and services for the facility under the same terms and conditions set forth in the management agreement 
if we want to open a new facility  brmg must use its best efforts to provide medical personnel under the same terms and conditions set forth in the management agreement 
if brmg cannot provide such personnel  we have the right to contract with other physicians to provide services at the facility 
brmg must maintain medical malpractice insurance for each of its physicians with coverage limits not less than million per incident and million in the aggregate per year 
brmg also has agreed to indemnify us for any losses we suffer that arise out of the acts or omissions of brmg and its employees  contractors and agents 
non california locations and california locations at the centers in california that brmg does not provide professional medical services  and at all of the centers which are located outside of california  we have entered into long term contracts with prominent third party radiology groups in the area to provide physician services at those facilities 
these arrangements also allow us to comply with the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine in other states in which we operate except in florida which does not have an equivalent statute prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine 
these third party radiology practice groups provide professional services  including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures  in our diagnostic imaging centers 
the radiology practices maintain full control over the provision of professional services 
the contracted radiology practices generally have outstanding physician and practice credentials and reputations  strong competitive market positions  a broad sub specialty mix of physicians  a history of growth and potential for continued growth 
in these facilities we have entered into long term agreements typically years in length under which  in addition to obtaining technical fees for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services  we provide management services and receive a fee based on the practice group s professional revenue 
we typically receive of the technical reimbursements associated with imaging procedures plus certain fees paid to us for providing additional management services 
the radiology practice groups retain the professional reimbursements associated with imaging procedures after deducting certain additional management service fees paid to us 
additionally  we perform certain management services for a portion of the professional groups with whom we contract who provide professional radiology services at local hospitals 
for performing these management services  which include billing  collecting  transcription and medical coding  we receive management fees 
payors the fees charged for diagnostic imaging services performed at our facilities are paid by a diverse mix of payors  as illustrated for the following periods presented in the table below of net revenue year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  commercial insurance managed care capitated payors medicare medicaid other workers compensation personal injury includes blue cross blue shield plans  which represented of our net revenue for the year ended december   of our net revenue for the year ended december  and of our net revenue for the year ended december  includes co payments  direct patient payments and payments through contracts with physician groups and other non insurance company payors 
we have described below the types of reimbursement arrangements we have with third party payors 
commercial insurance generally  insurance companies reimburse us  directly or indirectly  including through brmg in california or through the contracted radiology groups elsewhere  on the basis of agreed upon rates 
these rates are on average approximately the same as the rates set forth in the medicare physician fee schedule for the particular service 
the patients are generally not responsible for any amount above the insurance allowable amount 
managed care capitation agreements under these agreements  which are generally between brmg in california and outside of california between the contracted radiology group and the payor  typically an independent physician group or other medical group  the payor pays a pre determined amount per member per month in exchange for the radiology group providing all necessary covered services to the managed care members included in the agreement 
these contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing outpatient diagnostic imaging services  including the risk of over use  from the payor to the radiology group and  as a result of our management agreement with the radiology group  to us 
we believe that through our comprehensive utilization management  or um  program we have become highly skilled at assessing and moderating the risks associated with the capitation agreements  so that these agreements are profitable for us 
our um program is managed by our um department  which consists of administrative and nursing staff as well as brmg medical staff who are actively involved with the referring physicians and payor management in both prospective and retrospective review programs 
our um program includes the following features  all of which are designed to manage our costs while ensuring that patients receive appropriate care physician education at the inception of a new capitation agreement  we provide the new referring physicians with binders of educational material comprised of proprietary information that we have prepared and third party information we have compiled  which are designed to address diagnostic strategies for common diseases 
we distribute additional material according to the referral practices of the group as determined in the retrospective analysis described below 
prospective review referring physicians are required to submit authorization requests for non emergency high intensity services mri  ct  special procedures and nuclear medicine studies 
the um medical staff  according to accepted practice guidelines  considers the necessity and appropriateness of each request 
notification is then sent to the imaging facility  referring physician and medical group 
appeals for cases not approved are directed to us 
the capitated payor has the final authority to uphold or deny our recommendation 
retrospective review we collect and sort encounter activity by payor  place of service  referring physician  exam type and date of service 
the data is then presented in quantitative and analytical form to facilitate understanding of utilization activity and to provide a comparison between fee for service and medicare equivalents 
our medical director prepares a quarterly report for each payor and referring physician  which we send to them 
when we find that a referring physician is over utilizing services  we work with the physician to modify referral patterns 
medicare medicaid medicare is the federal health insurance program for people age or older and people under age with certain disabilities 
medicaid  funded by both the federal government and states  is a state administered health insurance program for qualifying low income and medically needy persons 
for services for which we bill medicare directly or indirectly  including through contracted radiologists  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule 
medicare patients usually pay a co payment unless they have secondary insurance 
medicaid rates are set by the individual states for each state program and medicaid patients may be responsible for a modest co payment 
contracts with physician groups and other entities for some of our contracts with physician groups and other providers  we do not bill payors  but instead accept agreed upon rates for our radiology services 
contracts with physician groups and other non insurance company payors these payors reimburse us  directly or indirectly  on the basis of agreed upon rates 
these rates are typically at or below the rates set forth in the current medicare fee schedule for the particular service 
however  we often agree to a specified rate for mri and ct procedures that is not tied to the medicare fee schedule 
the patients are generally not responsible for the unreimbursed portion 
facilities through our wholly owned subsidiaries  we operate fixed site  freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging facilities in california  in the baltimore washington  dc area  in the rochester and hudson valley areas of new york  in delaware  eight in new jersey  as well as three individual facilities in florida and two in kansas 
we lease the premises at which these facilities are located 
our facilities are primarily located in regional networks that we refer to as regions 
the majority of our facilities are multi modality sites  offering various combinations of mri  ct  pet  nuclear medicine  ultrasound  x ray  fluoroscopy services and other related procedures 
a portion of our facilities are single modality sites  offering either x ray or mri services 
consistent with our regional network strategy  we locate our single modality facilities near multi modality facilities  to help accommodate overflow in targeted demographic areas 
the following table sets forth the number of our facilities for each year during the five year period ended december  year ended december total facilities owned or managed at beginning of the year facilities added by acquisition internal development facilities closed or sold total facilities owned or managed at year end includes radiologix facilities acquired on november  diagnostic imaging equipment the following table indicates  as of december   the quantity of principal diagnostic equipment available at our facilities  by region mri open mri ct pet ct mammo ultrasound x ray nucmed fluoroscopy total kansas california florida delaware new jersey new york maryland total the average age of our mri and ct units is less than six years  and the average age of our pet units is less than four years 
the useful life of our mri  ct and pet units is typically ten years 
facility acquisitions and divestitures information regarding our facility acquisitions can be found within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
information technology our corporate headquarters and many of our facilities are interconnected through a state of the art information technology system 
this system  which is compliant with the health insurance portability and accountability act of  is comprised of a number of integrated applications and provides a single operating platform for billing and collections  electronic medical records  practice management and image management 
this technology has created cost reductions for our facilities in areas such as image storage  support personnel and financial management and has further allowed us to optimize the productivity of all aspects of our business by enabling us to capture patient demographic  history and billing information at point of service  automatically generate bills and electronically file claims with third party payors  record and store diagnostic report images in digital format  digitally transmit in real time diagnostic images from one location to another  thus enabling networked radiologists to cover larger geographic markets by using the specialized training of other networked radiologists  perform claims  rejection and collection analysis  and perform sophisticated financial analysis  such as analyzing cost and profitability  volume  charges  current activity and patient case mix  with respect to each of our managed care contracts 
diagnostic reports and images are currently accessible via the internet by our california referring providers 
we have worked with some of the larger medical groups in california with whom we have contracts to provide access to this content through their web portals 
we are in the process of making such services available outside of california 
personnel at december   we had a total of  full time  part time and per diem employees  including those employed by brmg 
these numbers include full time and nine part time physicians and full time  part time and per diem technologists 
we employ site managers who are responsible for overseeing day to day and routine operations at each of our facilities  including staffing  modality and schedule coordination  referring physician and patient relations and purchasing of materials 
these site managers report to regional managers and directors  who are responsible for oversight of the operations of all facilities within their region  including sales  marketing and contracting 
the regional managers and directors  along with our directors of contracting  marketing  facilities  management purchasing and human resources report to our chief operating officers 
these officers  our chief financial officer  our director of information services and our medical director report to our chief executive officer 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement nor have we experienced any work stoppages 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
marketing our california marketing team consists of one director of marketing  six territory sales managers and customer service representatives 
our eastern marketing team consists of customer sales representatives and six sales managers who each report to a district manager 
our marketing team employs a multi pronged approach to marketing  including physician  payor and sports marketing programs 
physician marketing each customer service representative is responsible for marketing activity on behalf of one or more facilities 
the representatives act as a liaison between the facility and referring physicians  holding meetings periodically and on an as needed basis with them and their staff to present educational programs on new applications and uses of our systems and to address particular patient service issues that have arisen 
in our experience  consistent hands on contact with a referring physician and his or her staff generates goodwill and increases referrals 
the representatives also continually seek to establish referral relationships with new physicians and physician groups 
in addition to a base salary and a car allowance  each representative receives a quarterly bonus if the facility or facilities on behalf of which he or she markets meets specified net revenue goals for the quarter 
payor marketing our marketing team regularly meets with managed care organizations and insurance companies to solicit contracts and meet with existing contracting payors to solidify those relationships 
the comprehensiveness of our services  the geographic location of our facilities and the reputation of the physicians with whom we contract all serve as tools for obtaining new or repeat business from payors 
sports marketing program we have a sports marketing program designed to increase our public profile 
we provide x ray equipment and a technician for all of the basketball games of the lakers  clippers and sparks held at the staples center in los angeles  ducks hockey games held at the honda center in anaheim  and university of southern california football games held in the los angeles coliseum 
in exchange for this service  we receive game tickets and an advertisement in each team program throughout the season 
in addition  we have a close relationship with the physicians for some of these teams 
suppliers historically  we have acquired a majority of our advanced diagnostic imaging equipment from ge medical systems  inc  and we purchase medical supplies from various national vendors 
we believe that we have excellent working relationships with all of our major vendors 
however  there are several comparable vendors for our supplies that would be available to us if one of our current vendors becomes unavailable 
we primarily acquire our equipment with cash or through various financing arrangements with equipment vendors and third party equipment finance companies involving the use of capital leases with purchase options at minimal prices at the end of the lease term 
at december   capital lease obligations  excluding interest  totaled approximately million through  including current installments totaling approximately million 
if we open or acquire additional imaging facilities  we may have to incur material capital lease obligations 
timely  effective maintenance is essential for achieving high utilization rates of our imaging equipment 
we have an arrangement with ge medical systems  inc under which it has agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of a majority of our equipment for a fee that is based upon a percentage of our revenue  subject to a minimum payment 
net revenue is reduced by the provision for bad debts  mobile pet revenue and other professional reading service revenue to obtain adjusted net revenue 
competition the market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive 
we compete principally on the basis of our reputation  our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities  the location of our facilities  the quality of our diagnostic imaging services and technologists and the ability to establish and maintain relationships with healthcare providers and referring physicians 
we compete locally with groups of radiologists  established hospitals  clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment 
our competitors include alliance healthcare services  inc  diagnostic imaging group  insight health services corp 
and american radiology services 
some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer  more advanced equipment 
in addition  some physician practices have established their own diagnostic imaging facilities within their group practices to compete with us 
we experience additional competition as a result of those activities 
each of the non brmg contracted radiology practices under the comprehensive services model has entered into agreements with its physician shareholders and full time employed radiologists that generally prohibit those shareholders and radiologists from competing for a period of two years within defined geographic regions after they cease to be owners or employees  as applicable 
in certain states  like california  a covenant not to compete is enforced in limited circumstances involving the sale of a business 
in other states  a covenant not to compete will be enforced only to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to public interest 
enforceability of a non compete covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent a court will enforce the contracted radiology practices covenants 
the inability of the contracted radiology practices or us to enforce radiologist s non compete covenants could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations 
liability insurance we maintain insurance policies with coverage we believe is appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business and consistent with industry practice 
however  adequate liability insurance may not be available to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all 
we maintain general liability insurance and professional liability insurance in commercially reasonable amounts 
additionally  we maintain workers compensation insurance on all of our employees 
coverage is placed on a statutory basis and responds to individual state s requirements 
pursuant to our agreements with physician groups with whom we contract  including brmg  each group must maintain medical malpractice insurance for each physician in the group  having coverage limits of not less than million per incident and million in the aggregate per year 
california s medical malpractice cap further reduces our exposure 
california places a  limit on non economic damages for medical malpractice cases 
non economic damages are defined as compensation for pain  suffering  inconvenience  physical impairment  disfigurement and other non pecuniary injury 
the cap applies whether the case is for injury or death  and it allows only one  recovery in a wrongful death case 
no cap applies to economic damages 
other states in which we now operate do not have similar limitations and in those states we believe our insurance coverage to be sufficient 
we maintain a million key man life insurance policy on the life of dr 
berger 
we are the beneficiary under the policy 
regulation general the healthcare industry is highly regulated  and we can give no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future 
our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon us  and the contracted radiology practices and their affiliated physicians obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses and other approvals  and operating in compliance with applicable healthcare regulations 
we believe that healthcare regulations will continue to change 
therefore  we monitor developments in healthcare law and modify our operations from time to time as the business and regulatory environment changes 
although we intend to continue to operate in compliance  we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately modify our operations so as to address changes in the regulatory environment 
licensing and certification laws ownership  construction  operation  expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various federal and state laws  regulations and approvals concerning licensing of facilities and personnel 
in addition  free standing diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services not performed as part of a physician office must meet medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility to bill the medicare program 
we may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals for any future acquisitions  expansions or replacements  and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the market for our services 
we have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has lengthened our billing and collection cycle 
corporate practice of medicine in the states in which we operate  a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or other similar professional organization is not allowed to practice medicine  including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice 
the laws of such states also prohibit a lay person or a non professional entity from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements  such as splitting professional fees with physicians 
we structure our relationships with the radiology practices  including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities  in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine  exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians  or violating the prohibitions against fee splitting 
there can be no assurance that our present arrangements with brmg or the other physicians providing medical services and medical supervision at our imaging facilities will not be challenged  and  if challenged  that they will not be found to violate the corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting prohibitions  thus subjecting us to a potential combination of damages  injunction and civil and criminal penalties or require us to restructure our arrangements in a way that would affect the control or quality of our services or change the amounts we receive under our management agreements  or both 
medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse our revenue is derived through our ownership  operation and management of diagnostic imaging centers and from service fees paid to us by contracted radiology practices 
during the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers was derived from federal government sponsored healthcare programs medicare and from state sponsored programs medicaid 
federal law known as the anti kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  i the referral of a person  ii the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs or iii the purchase  lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing  leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
enforcement of this anti kickback law is a high priority for the federal government  which has substantially increased enforcement resources and is scheduled to continue increasing such resources 
noncompliance with the federal anti kickback statute can result in exclusion from the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs and civil and criminal penalties 
as described above  the anti kickback statute is broad  and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry 
recognizing that the anti kickback statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry  the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services issued regulations in july of  which the department has referred to as safe harbors 
these safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which  if met in form and substance  will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal anti kickback statute 
additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since our arrangements with physicians  physician practice groups  hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors 
although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal anti kickback statute  the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal anti kickback statute will be pursued 
although some of our arrangements may not fall within a safe harbor  we believe that such business arrangements do not violate the anti kickback statute because we are careful to structure them to reflect fair market value and ensure that the reasons underlying our decision to enter into a business arrangement comport with reasonable interpretations of the anti kickback statute 
however  even though we continuously strive to comply with the requirements of the anti kickback statute  liability under the anti kickback statute may still arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business 
while we are not aware of any such intentions or actions  we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements 
conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the office of the inspector general 
significant prohibitions against physician referrals have been enacted by congress 
these prohibitions include the ethics in patient referral act of which is commonly known as the stark law 
the stark law prohibits a physician from referring medicare patients to an entity providing designated health services  as defined under the stark law  including  without limitation  radiology services  in which the physician or immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement 
the stark law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral 
the penalties for violating the stark law include a prohibition on payment by these governmental programs and civil penalties of as much as  for each violation referral and  for participation in a circumvention scheme 
we believe that  although we receive fees under our service agreements for management and administrative services  we are not in a position to make or influence referrals of patients 
on january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published the first phase of the final regulations to implement the stark law 
cms subsequently released phase two of the stark law final rule as a final rule effective july   phase three  effective on december   and finally  on august   cms finalized additional changes to the stark law which became effective on october  under the stark law  radiology and certain other imaging services and radiation therapy services and supplies are services included in the designated health services subject to the self referral prohibition 
such services include the professional and technical components of any diagnostic test or procedure using x rays  ultrasound or other imaging services  ct  mri  radiation therapy and diagnostic mammography services but not screening mammography services 
the stark law  however  excludes from designated health services i x ray  fluoroscopy or ultrasound procedures that require the insertion of a needle  catheter  tube or probe through the skin or into a body orifice  ii radiology procedures that are integral to the performance of  and performed during  non radiological medical procedures  and iii invasive or interventional radiology  because the radiology services in these procedures are merely incidental or secondary to another procedure that the physician has ordered 
beginning january   pet and nuclear medicine procedures are included as designated health services under the stark law 
the stark law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services or a request by a radiation oncologist for radiation therapy  if such services are furnished by or under the supervision of such radiologist or radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician  does not constitute a referral by a referring physician 
if such requirements are met  the stark law self referral prohibition would not apply to such services 
the effect of the stark law on the radiology practices  therefore  will depend on the precise scope of services furnished by each such practice s radiologists and whether such services derive from consultations or are self generated 
we believe that  other than self referred patients  all of the services covered by the stark law provided by the contracted radiology practices derive from requests for consultation by non affiliated physicians 
therefore  we believe that the stark law is not implicated by the financial relationships between our operations and the contracted radiology practices 
in addition  we believe that we have structured our acquisitions of the assets of existing practices  and we intend to structure any future acquisitions  so as not to violate the anti kickback statute and stark law and regulations 
specifically  we believe the consideration paid by us to physicians to acquire the tangible and intangible assets associated with their practices is consistent with fair market value in arms length transactions and is not intended to induce the referral of patients or other business generated by such physicians 
should any such practice be deemed to constitute an arrangement designed to induce the referral of medicare or medicaid patients  then our acquisitions could be viewed as possibly violating anti kickback and anti referral laws and regulations 
a determination of liability under any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the federal government embarked on an initiative to audit all medicare carriers  which are the companies that adjudicate and pay medicare claims 
these audits are expected to intensify governmental scrutiny of individual providers 
an unsatisfactory audit of any of our diagnostic imaging facilities or contracted radiology practices could result in any or all of the following significant repayment obligations  exclusion from the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs  and civil and criminal penalties 
federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased enforcement activities with respect to medicare  medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules  including laws and regulations that govern our activities and the activities of the radiology practices 
the federal government also has increased funding to fight healthcare fraud and is coordinating its enforcement efforts among various agencies  such as the us department of justice  the us department of health and human services office of inspector general  and state medicaid fraud control units 
the trend towards increased funding is also seen most recently in president obama s budget for fiscal year the government may investigate our or the radiology practices activities  claims may be made against us or the radiology practices and these increased enforcement activities may directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
state anti kickback and physician self referral laws many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute 
some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source  not only the medicare and medicaid programs 
although we believe that we comply with both federal and state anti kickback laws  any finding of a violation of these laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties or possible exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs 
such penalties would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business 
federal false claims act the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person who it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal false claims act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the united states by an individual  a whistleblower  who is an original source of the allegations 
the government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback law or stark law may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
penalties include civil penalties of not less than  and not more than  for each false claim  plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person 
recently  the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically 
further  on may   president obama signed into law the fraud enforcement and recovery act of fera  which greatly expanded the types of entities and conduct subject to the false claims act 
also  various states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act 
under the deficit reduction act of  or dra  states are being encouraged to adopt false claims acts similar to the federal false claims act  which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the state medicaid program and contain whistleblower provisions 
even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no judgment or settlement  we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation 
future actions under the false claims act may result in significant fines and legal fees  which would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business 
we believe that we are in compliance with the rules and regulations that apply to the federal false claims act as well as its state counterparts 
however  we could be found to have violated certain rules and regulations resulting in sanctions under the federal false claims act or its state counterparts 
if we are so found in violation  any sanctions imposed could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs that are integral to our business 
healthcare reform initiatives currently pending before the united states congress is health care reform legislation which  if enacted  could affect the amount of reimbursement from federally funded health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
changes in reimbursement for services rendered to beneficiaries of medicare managed care or medicare advantage plans  may also impact our finances in general 
we cannot predict at this time the nature of the final reform legislation  whether current initiatives will be finalized or their effects on radiology service providers such as us 
health insurance portability and accountability act of congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  in part  to combat healthcare fraud and to protect the privacy and security of patients individually identifiable healthcare information 
hipaa  among other things  amends existing crimes and criminal penalties for medicare fraud and enacts new federal healthcare fraud crimes  including actions affecting non government healthcare benefit programs 
under hipaa  a healthcare benefit program includes any private plan or contract affecting interstate commerce under which any medical benefit  item or service is provided 
a person or entity that knowingly and willfully obtains the money or property of any healthcare benefit program by means of false or fraudulent representations in connection with the delivery of healthcare services is subject to a fine or imprisonment  or potentially both 
in addition  hipaa authorizes the imposition of civil money penalties against entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded medicare or medicaid program participants if such entities provide services to federal health program beneficiaries 
a finding of liability under hipaa could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  hipaa requires healthcare providers and their business associates to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information phi 
hipaa imposes federal standards for electronic transactions  for the security of electronic health information and for protecting the privacy of phi 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of hitech  signed into law on february   dramatically expanded  among other things  the scope of hipaa to now apply directly to business associates  or independent contractors who receive or obtain phi in connection with providing a service to a covered entity  substantive security and privacy obligations  including new federal security breach notification requirements to affected individuals  dhhs and prominent media outlets  of certain breaches of unsecured phi  restrictions on marketing communications and a prohibition on covered entities or business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for phi  and the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for hipaa violations  increasing the annual cap in penalties from  to million per year 
in addition  many states have enacted comparable privacy and security statutes or regulations that  in some cases  are more stringent than hipaa requirements 
in those cases it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws  which may entail significant and costly changes for us 
we believe that we are in compliance with such state laws and regulations 
however  if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations  we could be subject to additional sanctions 
we believe that we are in compliance with the current hipaa requirements  as amended by hitech  and comparable state laws  but we anticipate that we may encounter certain costs associated with future compliance 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that enforcement agencies or courts will not make interpretations of the hipaa standards that are inconsistent with ours  or the interpretations of our contracted radiology practices or their affiliated physicians 
a finding of liability under the hipaa standards may result in significant criminal and civil penalties 
noncompliance also may result in exclusion from participation in government programs  including medicare and medicaid 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
compliance program we maintain a program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities 
we have a compliance officer who is charged with implementing and supervising our compliance program  which includes the adoption of i standards of conduct for our employees and affiliates and ii a process that specifies how employees  affiliates and others may report regulatory or ethical concerns to our compliance officer 
we believe that our compliance program meets the relevant standards provided by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services 
an important part of our compliance program consists of conducting periodic audits of various aspects of our operations and that of the contracted radiology practices 
we also conduct mandatory educational programs designed to familiarize our employees with the regulatory requirements and specific elements of our compliance program 
us food and drug administration or fda the fda has issued the requisite pre market approval for all of the mri and ct systems we use 
we do not believe that any further fda approval is required in connection with the majority of equipment currently in operation or proposed to be operated  except under regulations issued by the fda pursuant to the mammography quality standards act of  as amended by the mammography quality standards reauthorization acts of and collectively  the mqsa 
all mammography facilities are required to meet the applicable mqsa requirements  including quality standards  be accredited by an approved accreditation body or state agency and certified by the fda or an fda approved certifying state agency 
pursuant to the accreditation process  each facility providing mammography services must comply with certain standards that include  among other things  annual inspection of the facility s equipment  personnel interpreting physicians  technologists and medical physicists and practices 
compliance with these mqsa requirements and standards is required to obtain medicare payment for services provided to beneficiaries and to avoid various sanctions  including monetary penalties  or suspension of certification 
although the mammography accreditation program of the american college of radiology is an approved accreditation body and currently accredits all of our facilities which provide mammography services  and although we anticipate continuing to meet the requirements for accreditation  if we lose such accreditation  the fda could revoke our certification 
congress has extended medicare benefits to include coverage of screening mammography but coverage is subject to the facility performing the mammography meeting prescribed quality standards described above 
the medicare requirements to meet the standards apply to diagnostic mammography and image quality examination as well as screening mammography 
radiologist licensing the radiologists providing professional medical services at our facilities are subject to licensing and related regulations by the states in which they provide services 
as a result  we require brmg and the other radiology groups with which we contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain appropriate licensure 
we do not believe that such laws and regulations will either prohibit or require licensure approval of our business operations  although no assurances can be made that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted to extend such prohibitions or requirements to our operations 
insurance laws and regulation states in which we operate have adopted certain laws and regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry  including those that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk based managed care to applicable insurance laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements 
implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to the contracted radiology practices  limiting their ability to enter into capitated or other risk sharing managed care arrangements and indirectly affecting our revenue from the contracted practices 
environmental matters the facilities we operate or manage generate hazardous and medical waste subject to federal and state requirements regarding handling and disposal 
we believe that the facilities that we operate and manage are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the handling and disposal of such materials 
we do not believe that we will be required to expend any material additional amounts in order to remain in compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
deficit reduction act of dra on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act  or dra 
effective january   the dra provides that medicare reimbursement for the technical component for imaging services excluding diagnostic and screening mammography performed in freestanding facilities will be capped 
payment will be the lesser of the medicare physician fee schedule or the hospital outpatient prospective payment system hopps rates 
implementation of these reimbursement reductions contained in the dra has had a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the dra also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts previously announced by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  the agency responsible for administering the medicare program 
in november  cms announced that it would pay of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and of the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for imaging procedures involving contiguous body parts within a family of codes when performed in the same session 
cms had indicated that it would phase in this rate reduction over two years  so that the reduction was for each additional imaging procedure in and another in to date  cms has implemented the reduction for each additional procedure but has not yet implemented the additional reduction scheduled for the us congress is currently considering legislative proposals that would change the percentage reduction to require the additional reduction 
at this time  we cannot predict the impact on our business if the proposal is passed 
item a 
risk factors if brmg or any of our other contracted radiology practices terminate their agreements with us  our business could substantially diminish 
our relationship with brmg is an integral part of our business 
through our management agreement  brmg provides all of the professional medical services at of our california facilities 
professional medical services are provided at the balance of our other facilities through management contracts with other radiology groups 
brmg and these other radiology groups contract with various other independent physicians and physician groups to provide all of the professional medical services at most of our facilities  and they must use their best efforts to provide the professional medical services at any new facilities that we open or acquire in their areas of operation 
in addition  brmg and the other radiology groups strong relationships with referring physicians are largely responsible for the revenue generated at the facilities they service 
although our management agreement with brmg runs until  and for terms as long  if not longer  with the other groups  brmg and the other radiology groups have the right to terminate the agreements if we default on our obligations and fail to cure the default 
also  the various radiology groups ability to continue performing under the management agreements may be curtailed or eliminated due to the groups financial difficulties  loss of physicians or other circumstances 
if the radiology groups cannot perform their obligations to us  we would need to contract with one or more other radiology groups to provide the professional medical services at the facilities serviced by the group 
we may not be able to locate radiology groups willing to provide those services on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we were able to do so  any replacement radiology group s relationships with referring physicians may not be as extensive as those of the terminated group 
in any such event  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  the radiology groups are party to substantially all of the managed care contracts from which we derive revenue 
if we were unable to readily replace these contracts  our revenue would be negatively affected 
adverse changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition  or liquidity 
we are subject to risk arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions  including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit and the united states mortgage market have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
added concerns fueled by the united states government s financial assistance to certain companies and other federal government s interventions in the united states financial system has led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
we believe our mri and pet ct scan volumes have been impacted in by rising unemployment rates  the number of under insured or uninsured patients and other conditions arising from the global economic conditions described above 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our customers  to timely replace maturing liabilities  and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced operating losses and we have a substantial accumulated deficit 
if we are unable to improve our financial performance  we may be unable to pay our obligations 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have been successful in significantly reducing our net losses over the past two years 
we expect to continue this trend and to begin generating net income 
however  we cannot provide any assurances as to the likelihood  timing  or extent of our ability to achieve net income from operations 
if we cannot generate income from operations in sufficient amounts  we will not be able to pay our obligations as they become due 
our inability to generate income from operations to pay our obligations could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends in part on our key personnel and loss of key executives could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  former employees and radiology practices we have previously contracted with could use the experience and relationships developed while employed or under contract with us to compete with us 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior and executive management  managerial and technical personnel 
competition in recruiting these personnel may make it difficult for us to continue our growth and success 
the loss of their services or our inability in the future to attract and retain management and other key personnel could hinder the implementation of our business strategy 
the loss of the services of dr

hames or stephen m 
forthuber  our chief operating officers  west and east coast  respectively  could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
we believe that they could not easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities 
we do not maintain key person insurance on the life of any of our executive officers with the exception of a million policy on the life of dr 
berger 
also  if we lose the services of dr 
berger  our relationship with brmg could deteriorate  which would materially adversely affect our business 
many of the states in which we operate do not enforce agreements that prohibit a former employee from competing with a former employer 
as a result  many of our employees whose employment is terminated are free to compete with us  subject to prohibitions on the use of confidential information and  depending on the terms of the employee s employment agreement  on solicitation of existing employees and customers 
a former executive  manager or other key employee who joins one of our competitors could use the relationships he or she established with third party payors  radiologists or referring physicians while our employee and the industry knowledge he or she acquired during that tenure to enhance the new employer s ability to compete with us 
the agreements with most of our radiology practices contain non compete provisions however the enforceability of these provisions is determined by a court based on all the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
the inability of us to enforce radiologists non compete provisions could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations 
the california budget crisis  if not successfully resolved could have an impact on our revenue 
california is experiencing a budget crisis which has resulted in significant state government cutbacks 
of our facilities are located in california 
one to one and one half percent to of our revenues come from the california medicaid program million to million 
to the extent california is unable to provide these payments on a timely basis  or at all  our revenues will be negatively impacted 
our failure to integrate the businesses we acquire successfully and on a timely basis could reduce our profitability 
we may never realize expected synergies  business opportunities and growth prospects in connection with our acquisitions 
we may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business 
we may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities  assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate  or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate 
in addition  integrating operations will require significant efforts and expenses on our part 
personnel may leave or be terminated because of an acquisition 
our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate an acquisition 
if these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of an acquisition successfully or on a timely basis  our expectations of future results of operations  including certain cost savings and synergies as a result of the acquisition  may not be met 
in addition  our growth and operating strategies for a target s business may be different from the strategies that the target company pursued prior to our acquisition 
if our strategies are not the proper strategies  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and other contractual obligations will depend on our future financial performance 
a range of economic  competitive  regulatory  legislative and business factors  many of which are outside of our control  will affect our financial performance 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt and other contractual obligations would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to generate revenue depends in large part on referrals from physicians 
a significant reduction in physician referrals would have a negative impact on our business 
we derive substantially all of our net revenue  directly or indirectly  from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at our facilities 
we depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties who have no contractual obligations to refer patients to us for a substantial portion of the services we perform 
if a sufficiently large number of these physicians and other third parties were to discontinue referring patients to us  our scan volume could decrease  which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins 
further  commercial third party payors have implemented programs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us 
for example  prepaid healthcare plans  such as health maintenance organizations  sometimes contract directly with providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services exclusively from those providers 
some insurance companies and self insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers 
these closed panel systems are now common in the managed care environment 
other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers outside the system s designated panel of providers 
if we are unable to compete successfully for these managed care contracts  our results and prospects for growth could be adversely affected 
the regulatory framework in which we operate is uncertain and evolving 
healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future 
we continuously monitor these developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes 
we cannot assure you however  that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  although we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  neither our current or anticipated business operations nor the operations of the contracted radiology practices have been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation 
we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations 
certain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry  including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk based managed care contracting to applicable insurance laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations  if adopted in the states in which we operate  may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements 
implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limit our ability to enter into capitation or other risk sharing managed care arrangements 
changes in the method or rates of third party reimbursement could have a negative impact on our results 
from time to time  changes designed to contain healthcare costs have been implemented  some of which have resulted in decreased reimbursement rates for diagnostic imaging services that impact our business 
for services for which we bill medicare directly  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
for example  for  the fee schedule rates were to be reduced by approximately 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of eliminated the reduction for and increased the annual payment rate update by 
this increase to the annual medicare physician fee schedule payment update was effective only for medicare claims with dates of service between january  and june  beginning july   under the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of mippa  the increase was continued for the rest of in addition  mippa established a increase to the medicare physician fee schedule payment update for for  cms is projecting a rate reduction of 
however  on december   congress enacted the department of defense appropriations act of  which provided a two month update to the medicare physician fee schedule effective only for dates of service january  through february  this was further extended through march  by the temporary extension act of it remains uncertain whether congress will enact legislation to revise the formula which determines the annual update to the conversion factor and payment rates  or if  once again  it will pass additional legislation to delay the payment reductions 
it is also possible that no action will be taken and the reduction in payments will be implemented 
 mippa also modified the methodology by which the budget neutrality formula was applied to the physician fee schedule payment rates  resulting in an overall reduction in payment rates for services performed by many specialties  including an estimated reduction for radiation oncology and reduction for nuclear medicine 
the impact of these payment rate reductions could impact the company s future revenue depending upon our service mix 
a number of other legislative changes impact our business 
for example  dra imposed caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services furnished in physician s offices and other non hospital based settings 
the caps impact mri and pet ct 
under the cap  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
this change applies to services furnished on or after january  the limitation is applicable to the technical components of the diagnostic imaging services only  which is the payment we receive for the services for which we bill directly under the medicare physician fee schedule 
the dra also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts  which was previously announced by cms 
the dra mandated payment at of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and for the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for multiple images of contiguous body parts within a family of codes performed in the same session 
to date  cms only implemented a reduction for each additional imaging procedure on contiguous body parts  beginning in the us congress is currently considering legislative proposals that would require the percentage reduction of to be further reduced to 
regulatory updates to payment rates for which we bill the medicare program directly are published annually by cms 
for payments under the physician fee schedule for calendar year  cms changed the way it calculates components of the medicare physician fee schedule 
first  cms reduced payment rates for certain diagnostic services using equipment costing more than million through revisions to usage assumptions from the current usage rate to a usage rate 
this change applied to mri and ct scans 
congress is currently considering legislative proposals that would result in lower usage assumptions and  if finalized  would supersede cms s regulatory changes  resulting in higher payments 
further with respect to its changes  cms also reduced payment for services primarily involving the technical component rather than the physician work component  including the services we provide  by adjusting downward malpractice payments for these services 
the reductions primarily impacted radiology and other diagnostic tests 
all these changes to the medicare fee schedule will be transitioned over a four year period such that beginning in  cms will fully implement the revised payment rates 
cms projects that the combined impact of these changes  when fully implemented will result in an estimated reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing diagnostic tests generally 
for the transitioned payment  cms estimates the impact of its changes will result in a reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing the technical component of diagnostic tests generally 
these impacts are calculated prior to any application of the projected negative update factor of which will be implemented in april unless congress intervenes related to mippa and may impact our future revenues 
pressure to control healthcare costs could have a negative impact on our results 
one of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations is to control the cost of healthcare services 
healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to refer diagnostic imaging tests to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patient is enrolled 
in addition  managed care contracting has become very competitive  and reimbursement schedules are at or below medicare reimbursement levels 
the expansion of health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within the geographic areas covered by our network could have a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of our services  because these organizations will exert greater control over patients access to diagnostic imaging services  the selections of the provider of such services and reimbursement rates for those services 
if our contracted radiology practices  including brmg  lose a significant number of their radiologists  our financial results could be adversely affected 
at times  there has been a shortage of qualified radiologists in some of the regional markets we serve 
in addition  competition in recruiting radiologists may make it difficult for our contracted radiology practices to maintain adequate levels of radiologists 
if a significant number of radiologists terminates their relationships with our contracted radiology practices and those radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill their obligations under our agreements with them  our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging facilities and our financial results could be adversely affected 
for example  in fiscal  due to a shortage of qualified radiologists in the marketplace  brmg experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining physicians and thus engaged independent contractors and part time fill in physicians 
their cost was double the salary of a regular brmg full time physician 
increased expenses to brmg will impact our financial results because the management fee we receive from brmg  which is based on a percentage of brmg s collections  is adjusted annually to take into account the expenses of brmg 
neither we  nor our contracted radiology practices  maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians 
we may not be able to successfully grow our business  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to successfully expand through acquiring facilities  developing new facilities  adding equipment at existing facilities  and directly or indirectly entering into contractual relationships with high quality radiology practices depends upon many factors  including our ability to identify attractive and willing candidates for acquisitions  identify locations in existing or new markets for development of new facilities  comply with legal requirements affecting our arrangements with contracted radiology practices  including state prohibitions on fee splitting  corporate practice of medicine and self referrals  obtain regulatory approvals where necessary and comply with licensing and certification requirements applicable to our diagnostic imaging facilities  the contracted radiology practices and the physicians associated with the contracted radiology practices  recruit a sufficient number of qualified radiology technologists and other non medical personnel  expand our infrastructure and management  and compete for opportunities 
we may not be able to compete effectively for the acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities 
our competitors may have more established operating histories and greater resources than we do 
competition may also make any acquisitions more expensive 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the following inability to obtain adequate financing  possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention and resources  failure to retain key personnel  difficulties in integrating new operations into our existing infrastructure  and amortization or write offs of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill 
if we are unable to successfully grow our business through acquisitions it could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may become subject to professional malpractice liability  which could be costly and negatively impact our business 
the physicians employed by our contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to malpractice claims 
we structure our relationships with the practices under our management agreements in a manner that we believe does not constitute the practice of medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians employed by the contracted radiology practices 
nevertheless  claims  suits or complaints relating to services provided by the contracted radiology practices have been asserted against us in the past and may be asserted against us in the future 
in addition  we may be subject to professional liability claims  including  without limitation  for improper use or malfunction of our diagnostic imaging equipment or for accidental contamination or injury from exposure to radiation 
we may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance to protect us against those claims at acceptable costs or at all 
any claim made against us that is not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend  result in a substantial damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations  all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
in addition  successful claims against us may adversely affect our business or reputation 
although california places a  limit on non economic damages for medical malpractice cases  no limit applies to economic damages and no such limits exist in the other states in which we now provide services 
we may not receive payment from some of our healthcare provider customers because of their financial circumstances 
some of our healthcare provider customers do not have significant financial resources  liquidity or access to capital 
if these customers experience financial difficulties they may be unable to pay us for the equipment and services that we provide 
a significant deterioration in general or local economic conditions could have a material adverse affect on the financial health of certain of our healthcare provider customers 
as a result  we may have to increase the amounts of accounts receivables that we write off  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
some of our imaging modalities use radioactive materials  which generate regulated waste and could subject us to liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental and health and safety laws 
some of our imaging procedures use radioactive materials  which generate medical and other regulated wastes 
for example  patients are injected with a radioactive substance before undergoing a pet scan 
storage  use and disposal of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical injury 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management s attention in order to comply with current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
also  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials 
although we believe that we maintain professional liability insurance coverage consistent with industry practice in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our professional liability insurance 
we experience competition from other diagnostic imaging companies and hospitals  and this competition could adversely affect our revenue and business 
the market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive 
we compete principally on the basis of our reputation  our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities  the location of our facilities and the quality of our diagnostic imaging services 
we compete locally with groups of radiologists  established hospitals  clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment 
our competitors include alliance healthcare services  inc  diagnostic imaging group  insight health services corp 
and american radiology services 
some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer  more advanced equipment 
in addition  some physician practices have established their own diagnostic imaging facilities within their group practices and compete with us 
we are experiencing increased competition as a result of such activities  and if we are unable to successfully compete  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
state and federal anti kickback and anti self referral laws may adversely affect income 
various federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  the referral of medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare program patients  or in return for  or to induce  the purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare programs 
similarly  many state laws prohibit the solicitation  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for  or to induce the referral of patients in private as well as government programs 
violation of these anti kickback laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities and or exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs 
we believe we are operating in compliance with applicable law and believe that our arrangements with providers would not be found to violate the anti kickback laws 
however  these laws could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our operations 
federal law prohibiting physician self referrals  known as the stark law  prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician has a prohibited financial relationship with that entity  unless an exception applies 
certain radiology services are considered designated health services under the stark law 
although we believe our operations do not violate the stark law  our activities may be challenged 
if a challenge to our activities is successful  it could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  legislation may be enacted in the future that further addresses medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse or that imposes additional requirements or burdens on us 
in addition  under the dra  states enacting false claims statutes similar to the federal false claims act  which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the state medicaid program and contain qui tam or whistleblower provisions  receive an increased percentage of any recovery from a state medicaid judgment or settlement 
adoption of new false claims statutes in states where we operate may impose additional requirements or burdens on us 
technological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur significant costs to upgrade our equipment 
the development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may require us to upgrade and enhance our existing equipment before we may otherwise intend 
many companies currently manufacture diagnostic imaging equipment 
competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment 
this may accelerate the obsolescence of our equipment  and we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment and may not be able to maintain a competitive equipment base 
in addition  advances in technology may enable physicians and others to perform diagnostic imaging procedures without us 
if we are unable to deliver our services in the efficient and effective manner that payors  physicians and patients expect and thus our revenue could substantially decrease 
a failure to meet our capital expenditure requirements could adversely affect our business 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development expenses of new diagnostic imaging facilities and the acquisition of additional facilities and new diagnostic imaging equipment 
we incur capital expenditures to  among other things  upgrade and replace existing equipment for existing facilities and expand within our existing markets and enter new markets 
to the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations  funds are not available from our lenders or we are unable to structure or obtain financing through operating leases  long term installment notes or capital leases  we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
because we have high fixed costs  lower scan volumes per system could adversely affect our business 
the principal components of our expenses  excluding depreciation  consist of debt service  capital lease payments  compensation paid to technologists  salaries  real estate lease expenses and equipment maintenance costs 
because a majority of these expenses are fixed  a relatively small change in our revenue could have a disproportionate effect on our operating and financial results depending on the source of our revenue 
thus  decreased revenue as a result of lower scan volumes per system could result in lower margins  which could materially adversely affect our business 
capitation fee arrangements could reduce our operating margins 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our payments from capitation arrangements  and we intend to increase the revenue we derive from capitation arrangements in the future 
under capitation arrangements  the payor pays a pre determined amount per patient per month in exchange for us providing all necessary covered services to the patients covered under the arrangement 
these contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing diagnostic imaging services  including the risk of over use  from the payor to the provider 
our success depends in part on our ability to negotiate effectively  on behalf of the contracted radiology practices and our diagnostic imaging facilities  contracts with health maintenance organizations  employer groups and other third party payors for services to be provided on a capitated basis and to efficiently manage the utilization of those services 
if we are not successful in managing the utilization of services under these capitation arrangements or if patients or enrollees covered by these contracts require more frequent or extensive care than anticipated  we would incur unanticipated costs not offset by additional revenue  which would reduce operating margins 
we may be unable to effectively maintain our equipment or generate revenue when our equipment is not operational 
timely  effective service is essential to maintaining our reputation and high use rates on our imaging equipment 
although we have an agreement with ge medical systems pursuant to which it maintains and repairs the majority of our imaging equipment  this agreement does not compensate us for loss of revenue when our systems are not fully operational and our business interruption insurance may not provide sufficient coverage for the loss of revenue 
also  ge medical systems may not be able to perform repairs or supply needed parts in a timely manner  which could result in a loss of revenue 
therefore  if we experience more equipment malfunctions than anticipated or if we are unable to promptly obtain the service necessary to keep our equipment functioning effectively  our ability to provide services would be adversely affected and our revenue could decline 
disruption or malfunction in our information systems could adversely affect our business 
our information technology system is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  fires  floods and other natural disasters  power losses  computer systems failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic losses of data and similar events  and computer viruses  penetration by hackers seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other breaches of security 
we rely on our information systems to perform functions critical to our ability to operate  including patient scheduling  billing  collections  image storage and image transmission 
accordingly  an extended interruption in the system s function could significantly curtail  directly and indirectly  our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  harsh weather and other natural disasters 
our corporate headquarters and of our facilities are located in california  an area prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
three of our facilities are located in an area of florida that has suffered from hurricanes 
some of our facilities have been affected by snow and other harsh weather conditions 
an earthquake  harsh weather conditions or other natural disaster could decrease scan volume during affected periods and seriously impair our operations 
damage to our equipment or interruption of our business would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
complying with federal and state regulations is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are directly or indirectly through the radiology practices with which we contract subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the state governments in which we provide services  including the federal false claims act  the federal medicare and medicaid anti kickback laws  and state anti kickback prohibitions  federal and state billing and claims submission laws and regulations  the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of  and comparable state laws  the federal physician self referral prohibition commonly known as the stark law and the state equivalent of the stark law  state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non physicians and prohibit fee splitting arrangements involving physicians  federal and state laws governing the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic equipment we use in our business concerning patient safety  equipment operating specifications and radiation exposure levels  and state laws governing reimbursement for diagnostic services related to services compensable under workers compensation rules 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations to which we or the radiology practices with which we contract are subject  we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines and the curtailment of our operations 
any penalties  damages  fines or curtailment of our operations  individually or in the aggregate  could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
the risks of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 
any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
if we fail to comply with various licensure  certification and accreditation standards  we may be subject to loss of licensure  certification or accreditation  which would adversely affect our operations 
ownership  construction  operation  expansion and acquisition of our diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various federal and state laws  regulations and approvals concerning licensing of personnel  other required certificates for certain types of healthcare facilities and certain medical equipment 
in addition  freestanding diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services independent of a physician s office must be enrolled by medicare as an independent diagnostic treatment facility  or idtf  to bill the medicare program 
medicare carriers have discretion in applying the idtf requirements and therefore the application of these requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
in addition  federal legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic mri  pet ct  ct  and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by cms which currently include the american college of radiology acr  the intersocietal accreditation commission iac and the joint commission by january  our mri  ct  nuclear medicine  ultrasound and mammography facilities are currently accredited by the american college of radiology 
we may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals or accreditation for any future acquisitions  expansions or replacements  and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the opportunity to expand our services 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensure and certification 
if any facility loses its certification under the medicare program  then the facility will be ineligible to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue came from the medicare and medicaid programs 
a change in the applicable certification status of one of our facilities could adversely affect our other facilities and in turn us as a whole 
we have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has lengthened our billing and collection cycle  and could negatively impact our ability to collect revenue from patients covered by medicare 
credentialing of physicians is required by our payors prior to commencing payment 
our agreements with the contracted radiology practices must be structured to avoid the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
state law prohibits us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements  such as splitting professional fees with physicians 
these laws are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a component of our business has been to enter into management agreements with radiology practices 
we provide management  administrative  technical and other non medical services to the radiology practices in exchange for a service fee typically based on a percentage of the practice s revenue 
we structure our relationships with the radiology practices  including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities  in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians  or violating the prohibitions against fee splitting 
there can be no assurance that our present arrangements with brmg or the physicians providing medical services and medical supervision at our imaging facilities will not be challenged  and  if challenged  that they will not be found to violate the corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting prohibitions  thus subjecting us to potential damages  injunction and or civil and criminal penalties or require us to restructure our arrangements in a way that would affect the control or quality of our services and or change the amounts we receive under our management agreements 
any of these results could jeopardize our business 
future federal legislation could limit the prices we can charge for our services  which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to extensive existing government healthcare regulation  there have been and continue to be numerous initiatives at the federal and state levels for reforms affecting the payment for and availability of healthcare services  including proposals that would significantly limit reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
limitations on reimbursement amounts and other cost containment pressures have in the past resulted in a decrease in the revenue we receive for each scan we perform 
for example  the dra  which was signed into law on february   contained provisions affecting medicare payment for imaging services furnished in a number of settings 
currently pending before the united states congress is healthcare reform legislation which  if enacted  could affect the amount of reimbursement from federally funded health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
changes in reimbursement for services rendered to beneficiaries of medicare managed care or medicare advantage plans  may also impact our finances in general 
we cannot predict at this time the nature of the final reform legislation  whether current initiatives will be finalized and their effects on radiology service providers such as us 
our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
our current substantial indebtedness and any future indebtedness we incur could adversely affect our financial condition  which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors 
as of december   our total indebtedness was million 
our substantial indebtedness could also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all 
we will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although our existing credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions  and under certain circumstances  the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
if we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness or to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  our financial condition would be materially harmed  our business may fail and you may lose all of your investment 
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  business and other factors beyond our control 
as a result of the recent global market and economic conditions  the cost and availability of credit and equity capital have been severely impacted 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
possible volatility in our stock price could negatively affect us and our stockholders 
the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during the period from january  through december   the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
in the past  we have experienced a drop in stock price following an announcement of disappointing earnings or earnings guidance 
any such announcement in the future could lead to a similar drop in stock price 
the price of our common stock could also be subject to wide fluctuations in the future as a result of a number of other factors  including the following changes in expectations as to future financial performance or buy sell recommendations of securities analysts  our  or a competitor s  announcement of new services  or significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  and the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 
in addition  the us securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets 
broad market and industry factors may lead to volatility in the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
moreover  our stock has limited trading volume  and this illiquidity may increase the volatility of our stock price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
the institution of similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could negatively affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law and our organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us 
in the future  we could become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  our organizational documents and the general corporation law of the state of delaware both contain provisions that will impede the removal of directors and may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
for example  the provisions permit the board of directors to increase its own size  within the maximum limitations set forth in the bylaws  and fill the resulting vacancies  authorize the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote  and establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders  including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control

this data should be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial data set forth below and discussed in this annual report are derived from the consolidated financial statements of radnet  its subsidiaries and certain affiliates 
as a result of the contractual and operational relationship among brmg  dr 
berger and us  we are considered to have a controlling financial interest in brmg pursuant to applicable accounting guidance 
due to the deemed controlling financial interest  we are required to include brmg as a consolidated entity in our consolidated financial statements 
this means  for example  that revenue generated by brmg from the provision of professional medical services to our patients  as well as brmg s costs of providing those services  are included as net revenue in our consolidated statement of operations  whereas the management fee that brmg pays to us under our management agreement with brmg is eliminated as a result of the consolidation of our results with those of brmg 
also  because brmg is a consolidated entity in our financial statements  any borrowings or advances we have received from or made to brmg have been eliminated in our consolidated balance sheet 
if brmg were not treated as a consolidated entity in our consolidated financial statements  the presentation of certain items in our income statement  such as net revenue and costs and expenses  would change but our net income would not  because in operation and historically  the annual revenue of brmg from all sources closely approximates its expenses  including dr

our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures  often minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients 
our services include magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  nuclear medicine  mammography  ultrasound  diagnostic radiology x ray  fluoroscopy and other related procedures 
the vast majority of our centers offer multi modality imaging services  a key point of differentiation from our competitors 
our multi modality strategy diversifies revenue streams  reduces exposure to reimbursement changes  and provides patients and referring physicians one location to serve the needs of multiple procedures 
we seek to develop regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies 
our scale and density within our selected geographies provides close  long term relationships with key payors  radiology groups and referring physicians 
each of our facility managers is responsible for meeting our standards of patient service  managing relationships with local physicians and payors and maintaining profitability 
we provide corporate training programs  standardized policies and procedures and sharing of best practices among our regional networks 
as of december   we had in operation mri systems  ct systems  pet or combination pet ct systems  nuclear medicine systems  x ray systems  mammography systems and fluoroscopy systems 
our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of payors  including private payors  managed care capitated payors and government payors 
we believe our payor diversity mitigates our exposure to possible unfavorable reimbursement trends within any one payor class 
in addition  our experience with capitation arrangements over the last several years has provided us with the expertise to manage utilization and pricing effectively  resulting in a predictable stream of revenue 
as of december   we received approximately of our payments from commercial insurance payors  from managed care capitated payors  from medicare and from medicaid 
with the exception of blue cross blue shield and government payors  no single payor accounted for more than of our net revenue for the twelve months ended december  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of radnet management and brmg 
the consolidated financial statements also include radnet management i  inc  radnet management ii  inc  radiologix  inc  radnet management imaging services  inc  delaware imaging partners  inc  new jersey imaging partners  inc 
and diagnostic imaging services  inc dis  all wholly owned subsidiaries of radnet management 
all of these affiliated entities are referred to collectively as radnet  we  us  our or the company in this report 
recent developments on february   we amended and extended for approximately five additional years our arrangement with ge medical systems under which it has agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of a majority of our equipment through under this amended contract  we have obtained lower pricing for the maintenance and repair of the majority of our advanced imaging equipment and we will be eligible to earn rebates from purchasing other general electric products and services  such as medical equipment and information technology 
we believe this revised ge medical systems contract will provide us significant cost savings through the term of the agreement 
on march   as part of a plan to refinance our existing revolving line of credit  term loan b and second lien credit facility  that matures in  and  respectively  together with radnet management  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  we entered into a commitment and term loan engagement letter or  the commitment letter with barclays capital the investment banking division of barclays bank plc  deutsche bank securities inc  deutsche bank trust company americas  general electric capital corporation  ge capital markets  inc  royal bank of canada  rbc capital markets the brand name for the capital markets activities of royal bank of canada and its affiliates and jefferies finance llc together  the banks 
under the commitment letter  these banks have severally committed  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the commitment letter  to provide us with proposed new million senior secured revolving credit facility expiring on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the financing or  the new revolving credit facility  and we have agreed to seek commitments for a new million senior secured term loan maturing on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the financing or  the new term loan credit facility and together with the new revolving credit facility  the new senior secured credit facilities 
while the new term loan credit facility will be raised using the banks best efforts  the new revolving credit facility is committed by the banks  and would be undrawn at close and available to us upon successfully raising the new term loan credit facility 
radnet management  inc will be the borrower under the new senior secured credit facilities 
the new senior secured credit facilities will be unconditionally guaranteed by us  all current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries as well as certain affiliates of radnet management  inc the new senior secured credit facilities will be secured by a perfected first priority security interest in all of our and the guarantors tangible and intangible assets  including  but not limited to  a stock pledge of all current and future subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  we intend to offer approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt securities due or  the notes to qualified institutional buyers in a private placement  subject to market and other conditions 
the notes will be issued by radnet management  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and guaranteed by us and the subsidiaries that guarantee our new senior secured credit facilities  on a full and unconditional basis 
we expect to close the senior note issuance and the new senior secured credit facilities concurrently in april  and the closing of each would be conditioned upon the closing of the other 
the refinancing  upon completion  would extend the maturity of our debt  increase the size of our revolving credit facility by approximately million and further enhance our liquidity by approximately million of cash we intend to fund to our balance sheet upon closing the refinancing transaction 
on march   we announced that we had entered into letters of intent to acquire the business of the truxton medical group in bakersfield  california  and the new jersey operating subsidiary of health diagnostics  the cash consideration for which will be financed from a portion of the net proceeds of the new credit facilities and the notes 
we expect that aggregate consideration for the target acquisitions will be approximately million  plus the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the acquisitions are subject to the execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions 
truxton medical group offers a broad range of services  including mri  ct  pet ct  mammography  nuclear medicine  fluoroscopy  ultrasound  x ray and related procedures 
the facilities included in the new jersey acquisition operate a combination of mri  ct  pet ct  mammography  ultrasound and x ray 
industry trends prior to  for services for which we bill medicare directly  we were paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
for example  for  the fee schedule rates were to be reduced by approximately 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of eliminated the reduction for and increased the annual payment rate update by 
this increase to the annual medicare physician fee schedule payment update was effective only for medicare claims with dates of service between january  and june  beginning july   under mippa  the increase was continued for the rest of in addition  mippa established a increase to the medicare physician fee schedule payment update for for  the cms are projecting a rate reduction of unless congress intervenes again to avoid the payment reduction 
federal legislative proposals have been introduced to prevent the rate reduction 
in the meantime  under legislation signed by president obama  the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates are effective for claims through march  mippa also modified the methodology by which the budget neutrality formula was applied to the physician fee schedule payment rates  resulting in an overall reduction in payment rates for services performed by many specialties  including an estimated reduction for nuclear medicine 
the impact of the payment rates on specific companies depends on their service mix 
also with respect to mippa  the legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic mri  pet ct  ct  and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by cms which currently include the american college of radiology acr  the intersocietal accreditation commission iac and the joint commission by january  our mri  ct  nuclear medicine  ultrasound and mammography facilities are currently accredited by the american college of radiology 
a number of other legislative changes impact our retail business 
for example  beginning on january   the dra imposed caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services furnished in physician s offices and other non hospital based settings 
under the cap  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
the limitation is applicable to the technical components of the diagnostic imaging services only  which is the payment we receive for the services for which we bill directly under the medicare physician fee schedule 
cms issues on an annual basis the hospital outpatient prospective payment rates  which are used to develop the caps 
if the technical component of the service established under the physician fee schedule without including geographic adjustments exceeds the hospital outpatient payment amount for the service also without including geographic adjustments  then the payment is to be reduced 
in other words  in those instances where the technical component for the particular service is greater for the non hospital site  the dra directs that the hospital outpatient payment rate be substituted for the otherwise applicable physician fee schedule payment rate 
the dra also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts  which was previously announced by cms 
the dra mandated payment at of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and for the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for multiple images of contiguous body parts within a family of codes performed in the same session 
initially  cms announced that it would phase in this reimbursement reduction over a two year period  to include a reduction for each additional imaging procedure on contiguous body parts in and an additional reduction in to date  cms has not yet implemented the additional reduction scheduled for congress is currently considering legislative proposals that would require cms to implement the percentage reduction from to 
it is unclear whether this federal legislation will be passed 
regulatory updates to payment rates for which we bill the medicare program directly are published annually by cms 
for payments under the physician fee schedule for calendar year  cms changed the way it calculates components of the medicare physician fee schedule 
first  cms reduced payment rates for certain diagnostic services using equipment costing more than million through revisions to usage assumptions from the current usage rate to a usage rate 
this change applied to mri and ct scans 
congress is currently considering legislative proposals that would result in lower usage assumptions and  if finalized  would supersede cms s regulatory changes 
further with respect to its changes  cms also reduced payment for services primarily involving the technical component rather than the physician work component  including the services we provide  by adjusting downward malpractice payments for these services 
the reductions primarily impact radiology and other diagnostic tests 
after  cms will further reduce payments each year through by increasing the usage assumption rate to and further adjusting downward malpractice payments and other components of the technical component on our reimbursement 
cms projects that the combined impact on medicare reimbursement of these changes  when fully implemented will result in an estimated reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing diagnostic tests generally 
these impacts are calculated prior to any application of the projected negative update factor of related to mippa which will be implemented in april unless congress intervenes and may impact our future revenues 
currently pending before the united states congress is health care reform legislation which  if enacted  could affect the amount of reimbursement from federally funded health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
changes in reimbursement for services rendered to beneficiaries of medicare managed care or medicare advantage plans  may also impact on our finances in general 
we cannot predict at this time the nature of the final reform legislation  whether current initiatives will be finalized or their effects on radiology service providers such as us 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented 
concerns about the potential long term and wide spread recession  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
these conditions  combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to unusual volatility 
at this time  it is unclear what impact this might have on our future revenues or business 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations

loss on sale of equipment loss on sale of equipment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both years  this loss resulted from the sale of imaging equipment for scrape value upon acquisition of upgraded equipment 
severance costs during the year ended december   we recorded severance costs of  compared to  recorded during the year ended december  in each period  these costs were primarily associated with the integration of radiologix and other acquired operations 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the interest expense for the year ended december  includes million of amortization associated with a swap agreement that expired in april and the modification of two interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges see liquidity and capital resources below and amortization of deferred loan costs of million 
excluding the million one time amortization  interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in interest expense on our senior debt  partially offset by a million increase in interest expense on our interest rate swaps for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
gain on bargain purchase on june   we acquired the assets and business of nine imaging centers located in new jersey from medical resources  inc for approximately million 
at the time of the acquisition  we immediately sold the assets and business of one of those nine centers to an unrelated third party for approximately  we have made a preliminary purchase price allocation of the acquired assets and liabilities associated with the remaining eight centers at their respective fair values 
in accordance with accounting standards  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets over the acquisition consideration results in a gain on bargain purchase 
prior to recording a gain  the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid  assets acquired  and liabilities assumed have been properly valued 
the company underwent such a reassessment  and as a result  has recorded a gain on bargain purchase of approximately million 
we believe that the gain on bargain purchase resulted from various factors that impacted the sale of those new jersey assets 
the seller was performing a full liquidation of its assets for the benefit of its creditors 
upon liquidation of all of its assets  the seller intended to close its business 
the new jersey assets were the only remaining assets to be sold before a full wind down of the seller s business could be completed 
we believe that the seller was willing to accept a bargain purchase price from us in return for our ability to act more quickly and with greater certainty than any other prospective acquirer 
the decline in the credit markets made it difficult for other acquirers who relied upon third party financing to complete the transaction 
the relatively small size of the transaction for us  the lack of required third party financing and our expertise in completing similar transactions in the past gave the seller confidence that we could complete the transaction expeditiously and without difficulty 
other expense income for the year ended december   we recorded million of other expense primarily related to litigation

many of these expenses are variable in nature including medical supplies and billing fees  which increase with volume and repairs and maintenance under our ge service agreement as a percentage of net revenue 
overall  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the previous period 
the increase is consistent with our increase in procedure volumes at both existing centers as well as newly acquired centers 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period last year

we had a net loss attributable to our common stockholders of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also had a stockholder equity deficit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations 
in addition to operations  we require a significant amount of capital for the initial start up and development expense of new diagnostic imaging facilities  the acquisition of additional facilities and new diagnostic imaging equipment  and to service our existing debt and contractual obligations 
on november   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with ge commercial finance healthcare financial services the november credit facility 
this facility was used to finance our acquisition of radiologix  refinance existing indebtedness  pay transaction costs and expenses relating to our acquisition of radiologix and provide financing for working capital needs post acquisition 
the facility consists of a revolving credit facility of up to million  a million first lien term loan and a million second lien term loan 
the first lien term loan has a term of six years and the second lien term loan has a term of six and one half years 
interest is payable on all loans initially at an index rate plus the applicable index margin  as defined 
the index rate is initially a floating rate equal to the higher of the rate quoted from time to time by the wall street journal as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least of the nation s largest banks or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable index margin on each of the revolving credit facility and the term loan is and on the second lien term loan is 
we may request that the interest rate instead be based on libor plus the applicable libor margin  which is for the revolving credit facility and the term loan and for the second lien term loan 
the credit facility includes customary covenants for a facility of this type  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum total leverage ratio  maximum senior leverage ratio  limitations on indebtedness  contingent obligations  liens  capital expenditures  lease obligations  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions  redemption or repurchase of equity interests  subordinated debt payments and modifications  loans and investments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control and payment of consulting and management fees 
on august   we secured an incremental million incremental facility as part of our existing credit facilities with ge commercial finance healthcare financial services 
the incremental facility consists of an additional million as part of our first lien term loan and million of additional capacity under our existing revolving line of credit bringing the total capacity to million 
the incremental facility can be used to fund certain identified strategic initiatives and for general corporate purposes 
on february   we secured a second incremental million second incremental facility of capacity as part of our existing credit facilities with ge commercial finance healthcare financial services 
the second incremental facility consists of an additional million as part of our second lien term loan and the first lien term loan or revolving credit facility may be increased by up to an additional million sometime in the future 
as part of the transaction  partly due to the drop in libor of over since the credit facilities were established in november  we increased the applicable libor margin to for the revolving credit facility and first lien term loan and to for the second lien term loan 
the additions to our existing credit facilities are intended to provide capital for near term opportunities and future expansion 
as of december   we qualified to borrow up to million dollars under our existing credit facilities 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap  designated as a cash flow hedge  on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years  and on november   we entered into an interest rate swap  also designated as a cash flow hedge  on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years 
previously  the interest rate on the million first lien term and revolving credit facilities was based upon a spread over libor which floats with market conditions 
during the first quarter of we modified the two interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges described above 
the modifications  commonly referred to as blend and extends  extended the maturity of  and re priced these two interest rate swaps for an additional months  resulting in an estimated annualized cash interest expense savings of million 
with respect to the million interest rate swap  on january   we replaced the existing fixed libor rate of with a new rate of maturing on november  with respect to the million interest rate swap  on february  we replaced the existing fixed libor rate of with a new rate of also maturing on november  both modified interest swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as part of these modifications  the negative fair values of the original interest rate swaps  as well as a certain amount of accrued interest  associated with the original cash flow hedges were incorporated into the fair values of the new modified cash flow hedges 
the related accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl associated with the negative fair values of the original cash flow hedges on their dates of modification  which totaled million  was on a straight line basis to interest expense through november   the maturity date of the original cash flow hedges 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and other contractual obligations will depend on our future financial performance 
a range of economic  competitive  regulatory  legislative and business factors  many of which are outside of our control  will affect our financial performance 
although no assurance can be given  taking these factors into account  including our historical experience  we believe that through implementing our strategic plans and continuing to restructure our financial obligations  we will obtain sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations as they become due in the next twelve months

we have an arrangement with ge medical systems under which it has agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of a majority of our equipment for a fee that is based upon a percentage of our revenue  subject to a minimum payment 
net revenue is reduced by the provision for bad debts  mobile pet revenue and other professional reading service revenue to obtain adjusted net revenue 
critical accounting policies use of estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and our reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  defines critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
the most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition our consolidated net revenue consists of net patient fee for service revenue and revenue from capitation arrangements  or capitation revenue 
net patient service revenue is recognized at the time services are provided net of contractual adjustments based on our evaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts  past collection experience in relation to amounts billed and other relevant information 
the amount of expected collection is continually adjusted as more information is received and such adjustments are recorded in current operations 
contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for such services 
capitation revenue is recognized as revenue during the period in which we were obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans 
under these contracts  we receive a per enrollee amount each month covering all contracted services needed by the plan enrollees 
accounts receivable substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee for service contracts from third party payors  such as insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs  or directly from patients 
services are generally provided pursuant to one year contracts with healthcare providers 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our payors and maintain an allowance for bad debts based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we depreciate our long lived assets over their estimated economic useful lives with the exception of leasehold improvements where we use the shorter of the assets useful lives or the lease term of the facility for which these assets are associated 
deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance periodically 
if future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with our expectations  an adjustment to our allowance for net deferred tax assets may be required 
for net deferred tax assets we consider estimates of future taxable income  including tax planning strategies in determining whether our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill at december  totaled million 
goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations 
management evaluates goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  codified in fasb asc topic impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which uses comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we tested goodwill for impairment on october  based on our review  we noted no impairment related to goodwill as of october  however  if estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate our long lived assets property and equipment and definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long lived asset or definite lived intangible is less than the carrying value of that asset  an asset impairment charge must be recognized 
the amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset or in the case of assets we expect to sell  at fair value less costs to sell 
no indicators of impairment were identified with respect to our long lived assets as of december  derivative financial instruments the company holds derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of cash flows caused by movements in interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge  and  unless the instrument qualifies for the short cut method of hedge accounting  over the term of each hedging relationship 
the company s use of derivative financial instruments is limited to interest rate swaps  the purpose of which is to hedge the cash flows of variable rate indebtedness 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in accordance with asc topic  we designate our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings 
for interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  then reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings eg  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any ie  the ineffectiveness portion  or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness  are recognized in the statement of operations during the current period 
facility acquisitions on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  business combinations  codified in fasb asc topic asc topic changed how our business acquisitions are accounted for and impacts our financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
pursuant to asc topic  we are required to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value  with limited exceptions  and all transaction related costs are expensed 
subsequent changes  if any  to the acquisition date fair value that are the result of facts and circumstances that did not exist as of the acquisition date will be recognized as part of our on going operations 
in addition  topic impacts our goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions 
we applied the provisions of asc topic to the facility acquisitions subsequent to january  as discussed below

on june   we acquired the assets and business of nine imaging centers located in new jersey from a single owner for approximately million 
at the time of the acquisition  we immediately sold the assets and business of one of those nine centers to an unrelated third party for approximately  we have made a purchase price allocation of the acquired assets and liabilities associated with the remaining eight centers at their respective fair values 
in accordance with accounting standards  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets over the acquisition consideration results in a gain on bargain purchase 
prior to recording a gain  the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid  assets acquired  and liabilities assumed have been properly valued 
the company underwent such a reassessment  and as a result  has recorded a gain on bargain purchase of approximately million 
we believe that the gain on bargain purchase resulted from various factors that impacted the sale of those new jersey assets 
the seller was performing a full liquidation of its assets for the benefit of its creditors 
upon liquidation of all of its assets  the seller intended to close its business 
the new jersey assets were the only remaining assets to be sold before a full wind down of the seller s business could be completed 
we believe that the seller was willing to accept a bargain purchase price from us in return for our ability to act more quickly and with greater certainty than any other prospective acquirer 
the decline in the credit markets made it difficult for other acquirers who relied upon third party financing to complete the transaction 
the relatively small size of the transaction for us  the lack of required third party financing and our expertise in completing similar transactions in the past gave the seller confidence that we could complete the transaction expeditiously and without difficulty

recent accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas r codified in fasb asc topic  business combinations introduces significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions 
asc topic changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
pursuant to asc topic  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value  with limited exceptions  and all transaction related costs are expensed 
subsequent changes  if any  to the acquisition date fair value that are the result of facts and circumstances that did not exist as of the acquisition date will be recognized as part of on going operations 
in addition  topic will have an impact on the goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions 
the provisions of asc topic are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the company applied the provisions of asc topic to the facility acquisitions subsequent to january  as discussed in note sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 codified in fasb asc topic  is designed to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  asc topic eliminates the diversity that accounting for transactions between an entity and minority interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
the company adopted the provisions of asc topic on january  such provisions are applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which have been applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
accordingly  we have reclassified minority interests as a component of equity deficit and renamed this item non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and additionally  our net loss for the years ended december   and have been allocated between radnet  inc s common stockholders and noncontrolling interests 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 subsequent events  codified in fasb asc topic  which establishes general standards of accounting for  and requires disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the company adopted the provisions of asc topic for the quarter ended september  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification became the authoritative source of accounting principles accepted in the united states gaap recognized by the fasb 
all existing fasb accounting standards and guidance were superseded by the asc 
instead of issuing new accounting standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions and emerging issues task force abstracts  the fasb now issues accounting standards updates that update the codification 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws continue to be additional sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controller through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
asu also requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
asu is effective at the start of a reporting entity s first fiscal year beginning after november   or january   for a calendar year entity 
early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we sell our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency  exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
interest rate sensitivity 
a large portion of our interest expense is not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest in the united states because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates that were fixed when we entered into the note payable or capital lease obligation 
our credit facility however  which is classified as a long term liability on our financial statements  is interest expense sensitive to changes in the general level of interest in the united states because it is based upon an index rate plus a factor 
as noted in liquidity and capital resources above  we have entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on approximately million of our credit facility 
the remaining portion of the credit facility bears interest at rates that float as market conditions change  and as such  is subject to market risk
