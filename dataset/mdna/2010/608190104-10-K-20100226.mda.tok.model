the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily driven by lower sales and various cost savings initiatives implemented by the company  partially offset by approximately million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and approximately million for restructuring charges 
the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a higher mix of fixed costs on lower net sales  and restructuring costs

in the fourth quarter of  the company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly owned european entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in europe 
the company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to unilin  and the move allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations  to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies 
this restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary s taxable basis of its intellectual property 
the step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over years for tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that  based on the available evidence at the time  the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized 
the deferred tax asset recognized as of december  was approximately million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
cash flows had decreased from that projected as of december   primarily due to the slowing worldwide economy and declining sales volume 
the company determined that  given the current 
table of contents and expected economic conditions and the corresponding reductions in cash flows  its ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the transaction described above as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not 
accordingly the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the amount of million during the quarter ended september  year ended december   as compared with year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december   were  million  reflecting a decrease of million  or  from the  million reported for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately million due to the continued decline in the us residential markets  softening commercial demand and slowing european demand  partially offset by a benefit of approximately million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix  and a benefit of approximately million due to favorable foreign exchange rates

impairment of goodwill and intangibles during  the company recorded a  million impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of the company s goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests 
the company performed interim impairment tests because of a prolonged decline in the company s market capitalization which the company believes is primarily a result of the weakness in the us residential housing market and the slowing european economy 
in both the third and fourth quarters of  the company concluded that the weakness in the us residential housing market is likely to persist based on its review of  among other things  sequential quarterly housing starts  recent turmoil surrounding the nation s largest mortgage lenders  the potential negative impact on the availability of mortgage financing and housing start forecasts published by national home builder associations pushing recovery in the us residential housing market beyond the total impairment included million in the mohawk segment  million in the dal tile segment and million in the unilin segment 
if  in the future  the company s market capitalization and or the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units were to decline further  it may be necessary to record further impairment charges

table of contents income tax benefit expense the provision for income tax was million  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the effective tax rate for was as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of for the change in the tax rate was primarily due to the impact on pre tax earnings of the impairment charge on non deductible goodwill  the asset restructurings  and the recognition of a valuation allowance of million  which is described above  against certain deferred tax assets that the company believes is no longer more likely than not to be realized 
without the impact of these three items  the company would have reflected a provision for income tax of million  as compared to a provision of million for liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the company s capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  bank credit lines  term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectability can be reasonably assured 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost has been determined using the first in first out method fifo 
costs included in inventory include raw materials  direct and indirect labor and employee benefits  depreciation  general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage  anticipated future selling price  expected sales below cost  excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators of impairment 
the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches 
the company has identified mohawk  dal tile  unilin flooring  unilin chipboard and melamine  and unilin roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments 
the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and comparable company market multiples 
when developing these key judgments and assumptions  the company considers economic  operational and 
table of contents market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit 
however  estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectations regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur  such as continued declines in spending for new construction  remodeling and replacement activities  the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers  or a decline in comparable company market multiples  then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted 
generally  a moderate decline in estimated operating income or a small increase in wacc or a decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  royalty rates  wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets  which for the company are its trademarks  is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  royalty rates  wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks 
estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 
the company reviews its long lived asset groups  which include intangible assets subject to amortization  which for the company are its patents and customer relationships  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable 
recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups 
if such asset groups are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated 
the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated 
the company did record impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of  million in the company s effective tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s tax expense and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period 
the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates  including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time 
in the event that the company is not able to realize 
table of contents all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is provided 
the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
the company recorded valuation allowances of million in  million in and million in in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available as of the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  a replacement of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company has million accrued for uncertain tax positions 
environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings  as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable  the company consults with its internal experts 
the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc  formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc requires companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy 
additionally  companies are required to provide certain disclosures regarding instruments within the hierarchy  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each major category of assets and liabilities 
asc is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  for financial assets and liabilities and january  for non financial assets and liabilities 
the company s adoption of asc for financial assets and liabilities on january  and non financial assets and liabilities on january  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
