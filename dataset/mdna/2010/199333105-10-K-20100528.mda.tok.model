executive overview we are a leading global designer  marketer and manufacturer of a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and other attachments  actuators  rotary unions  and tire shredders serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end user markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
founded in  we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions 
we developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
ongoing initiatives include improving our productivity and increasing penetration of the european  latin american  and asian marketplaces 
in accordance with our strategy  we have been investing in our lean efforts across the company  new product development and directed sales and marketing activities 
shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on improvement of the fundamentals including n ew product development  market expansion  manufacturing efficiency  cost containment  efficient capital investment and a high degree of customer satisfaction 
over the course of its history  the company has resiliently withstood many business cycles and its strong cash flow profile has helped it to grow and expand globally 
reflecting on the recent global economic recession and credit crisis  we stand with a strong capital structure which includes excess cash reserves  significant revolver availability with an expiration of may  fixed rate long term debt which expires in and a strong free cash flow business profile 
we believe our liquidity strength and operational cost management actions have enabled us to withstand this downturn 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we consolidated our north american sales force and offered certain employees an incentive to voluntarily retire early 
the early retirement program consisted of two benefits a paid leave of absence an d an enhanced pension benefit 
in furtherance of our strategic reorganization  we completed the sale of one of our less strategic businesses  american lifts  generating million of proceeds during the third quarter of fiscal further  we are managing our business through this cycle with a lower fixed cost footprint than prior cycles and are aggressively reducing our fixed cost base further as we strategically reorganize our north american hoist and rigging operations 
the process includes the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility  of which two of the three projects were completed in the third quarter of fiscal and the third schedule for completion during the first quarter of fiscal the closures will result in a reduction of approximately  square feet of manufacturing space and generation of annual savings estimated at approximately million with approximately of the total million of restructuring charges related to manufacturing facility consolidation expected in fiscal these costs were being recognized beginning in the second quarter of fiscal and will continue into early fiscal we recorded total restructuring charges  including costs related to the early retirement program and paid leave of absence  of approximately million in fiscal and incurred an additional million of facility consolidation related costs categorized as costs of products sold in fiscal additionally  our revenue base now is more geographically diverse than in our company s history  with approximately derived outside the us in fiscal  which we believe will help to balance the impact of changes that will occur in different global economies at different times 
as in the past  we monitor us and eurozone industrial capacity utilization as an indicator of anticipated demand for our product 
these statistics weakened significantly between september and june  but have since consistently improved through march  in addition  we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and us trends  including industrial production  energy costs  steel price fluctuations  interest rates  currency exchange and activity in a variety of end user markets around the globe 
regardless of the economic climate  we constantly explore ways to manage our operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness  regardless of the point in the economic cycle 
we have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction  reduction of defects  shortened lead times  improved inventory turns and on time deliveries  reduction of warranty costs  and improved working capital utilization 
the initiatives are being driven by the continued implementation of our lean efforts which are fundamentally and culturally changing our manufacturing and business processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on time delivery and productivity 
in addition to lean  we are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through product simplification  the creation of centers of excellence  and improved supply chain management 
we continuously monitor market prices of steel 
we utilize approximately million to million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
generally  as we experience fluctuations in our costs  we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral 
our steel costs have been relatively stable during this quarter despite an increase in structural steel pricing experienced as the result of higher scrap surcharges and the outsourcing of cut to length processes in conjunction with our plant rationalization 
from a strategic perspective  we are investing in international markets and new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth 
we maintain a strong north american market share with significant leading market positions in hoists  lifting and sling chain  forged attachments and actuators 
we seek to maintain and enhance our market share by continuing and focusing our sales and marketing activities directed toward select north american and global sectors including entertainment  energy  construction  mining and food processing 
our fiscal acquisition of pfaff is enhancing our european market penetration as well as strengthening our global actuator offering 
further  we continue to invest in emerging market penetration  including the geographic regions of asia  eastern europe  and latin america 
we complement these a ctivities with continued investments in new product development  particularly products with global reach 
we are also looking for opportunities for growth via acquisitions or joint ventures 
the focus of our acquisition strategy centers on opportunities for international revenue growth and product line expansion in alignment with our existing core offering 
we continue to operate in a highly competitive and global business environment  effectively managing through a global economic cycle 
we face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in asia and other emerging markets 
while we continue to execute our long term growth strategy  we have weathered this cycle with our strong capital structure  including a solid cash position and flexible cost base  aggressively addressing costs and restructuring to future margin opportunities 
results of operations fiscal sales were million  down  or million compared with fiscal our pfaff acquisition contributed million to our sales for fiscal with the remaining business being down  or million  excluding pfaff 
the decline in sales was primarily due to volume decline resulting from the global economic slow down 
the divestiture of our american lift business as well as fewer shipping days also contributed to lower sales in fy by approximately million but was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact of approximately million 
in fiscal  net sales increased by million to million or from fiscal fiscal was marked by growth in the first half of the year followed by a significant decline in sales and orders received as a result of the rapid and severe contraction in industrial markets worldwide 
our pfaff acquisition contributed million to our sales growth in fiscal with the remaining business down approximately million 
fiscal was also impacted by the recovery of the us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the euro  and reported sales were unfavorably affected by million 
our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decline in gross profit margin of million or compared with fiscal was mostly due to under absorption of costs due to lower volume in all markets 
restructuring charges related to factory consolidation of approximately million as well as reserve related to an atypical product liability claim of million also contributed to lower margin in fiscal despite higher revenue  the fiscal margin compared with fiscal was negatively impacted by higher material  freight  and utility costs in the second and third quarters  one time accounting charges associated with the pfaff acquisition in the third quarter  as well as under absorption of costs in the fiscal f ourth quarter due to the rapid and significant decline in sales 
selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
decreases in fiscal selling expense of million or reflect aggressive efforts to reduce or eliminate costs as well as lower salaries  benefits and commissions by million on lower volume offset by million in increased variable compensation expense 
the fiscal increase was a result of the addition of the pfaff business contributing million and continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives offset by lower commissions incentives of million  marketing and travel expense of million as a result of and in response to the economic slowdown  and translation o f foreign currencies of million 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by million or primarily due to lower pension group health benefit costs of million and lower bad debt expense of million offset by increased variable compensation expense of million  and other miscellaneous items 
the fiscal increase was a result of the addition of the pfaff business contributing million  increased credit and collection reserves of million  increased fees for professional services of million and increased research and development costs of million  offset by lower employee benefit costs including variable compensation of million and foreign currency translation of million 
restructuring charges of million  million and million  or  and of net sales were recorded in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal charges resulted from the consolidation of our north american sales force  early retirement benefits offered and costs associated with the closure and downsizing of manufacturing facilities see further discussion above in executive overview 
the charges are primarily severance costs related to a company wide staff reduction effort in response to the sudden decline in economic conditions during the third and fourth quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million per diluted share associated with goodwill 
based on impairment testing performed as of february   we determined that impairment existed for goodwill related to our rest of products reporting unit 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
there were no goodwill impairments in fiscal or fiscal amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase is attributable to a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the pfaff acquisition 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease primarily resulted from slightly lower debt levels as we continue to execute our strategy of debt reduction and increased financial flexibility 
we incurred million and million in fiscal and  respectively  related to redemption gain costs associated with the repurchase of outstanding debt 
in fiscal  we recorded a million gain from a litigation settlement 
investment income loss of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  related to marketable securities held in the company s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary

after excluding the impact of the million impairment charge  none of which is deductible for tax purposes  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective rate for fiscal was positively impacted by foreign tax benefits and from us state net operating loss benefits 
fiscal income from continuing operations was adjusted for the million goodwill impairment charge  none of which is deductible for tax purposes the percentages vary from the us statutory rate due to varying effective tax rates at our foreign subsidiaries  and the jurisdictional mix of taxable income liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million  and million at march   and  respectively 
million of cash on hand was used for the pfaff acquisition in october of net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to lower operating performance on lower sales as a result of the continued weakness in the global economy as well as cash payments related to restructuring activities  partially offset by improved working capital management 
favorable changes in the net working capital affects on cash flows from operating activities included million in inventory  million in trade accounts payable  and million in accrued and other non current liabilities  partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable of million and prepa id expenses and other assets of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to weaker operating performance in fiscal million and an increase in cash used by discontinued operations million offset by higher cash from working capital components of million 
changes in net working capital included favorable changes of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory  and unfavorable changes in accounts payable of million as a result of the declining volume of business 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease in cash used of million compared to fiscal was primarily the result of million of cash used in fiscal for the pfaff acquisition as well as lower capital expenditures in fiscal the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million for capital expenditures 
the fiscal  and amounts benefited from million  million  and million  respectively  of proceeds from business  property and asset divestitures 
net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used by financing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to less debt repayment from continuing operations of million 
the decrease in cash used by financing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to less debt repayments from continuing operations of million offset by an additional million of payments by the company on outstanding debt of its divested business  univeyor 
fiscal  and include million  million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we entered into an amended  restated and expanded revolving credit facility dated december   providing availability up to a maximum of million 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under this recently amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  restructuring activities and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon no significant further deterioration in the economy and successful execution of our current business plan which focuses on continued implementation of lean manufacturing  and improving working capital utilization  specifically inventory management 
the restated revolving credit agreement has an initial term ending may   which can be extended to december  as long as our existing senior subordinated notes are paid in full on or prior to may  from proceeds of permitted indebtedness with a maturity of no earlier than january  provided there is no default  we may  on a one time basis  request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding million  subject to lender approval 
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding borrowings of and outstanding letters of credit of million  as of march  interest on the revolver is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by our total leverage ratio amounting to or basis points  respectively  based on our leverage ratio at march  the revolving credit facility is secured by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to of foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the restated revolving credit facility agreement places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and restrictions on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  key financial covenants include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x  a maximum total leverage ratio  net of cash  of x through june  and x thereafter  and maximum annual capital expenditures of million in fiscal and million thereafter excluding capital expenditures associated with a global erp system 
the senior subordinated notes notes issued on september  amounted to million at march  and are due november  provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
on or after november   the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from to on and after november  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future us subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
our capital lease obligations related to property and equipment leases amounted to million at march  capital lease obligations are included in senior debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the us the lines of credit are available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction 
as of march   significant unsecured credit lines totaled approximately million  of which 
million was drawn 
in addition to the above facilities  our foreign subsidiaries have certain secured credit lines 
as of march   significant secured credit lines totaled  of which million was drawn 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal more than five years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations uncertain tax positions projected pension and other post retirement obligation benefit payouts other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we intend to contribute approximately million to our pension plans for fiscal we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  improve productivity and customer responsiveness  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal were limited to investments required to accommodate facility consolidation and new product development activities 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations as part of the continuing evaluation of our businesses  we determined that our integrated material handling conveyor systems business univeyor a s no longer provided a strategic fit with its long term growth and operational objectives 
on july   we completed the sale of univeyor a s  which business represented the majority of our former solutions segment 
in accordance with the provisions of asc topic discontinued operations the results of operations of the univeyor business have been classified as such in the condensed  consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows presented herein 
in connection with the sale of univeyor a s on july   we used cash on hand to repay million in amounts outstanding on univeyor s lines of credit and fixed term bank debt 
in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note has been recorded at its estimated net realizable value of at the time of the divestiture 
principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  net of tax 
all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   and as of march    and  respectively  are primarily based on long term aa rated corporate bond rates 
the decrease in the discount rate for fiscal resulted in a million increase in projected benefit obligation 
the increase in the discount rates for fiscal  and resulted in an million  and million  respectively  decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of march   and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the assets realized actual gain of million in fiscal and actual losses of million in fiscal as a result of the significant volatility in us capital markets in fiscal and fiscal the assets realized gains of million in fiscal our under funded status as of march  and was million and million  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is down from the fiscal amount of million due to a decrease in amortization of unrecognized losses  improved expected returns on the somewhat recovered asset values and curtailment expenses of million not expected to re occur 
pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year is  expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march  and as of march  and as of march  is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns 
the healthcare costs inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal   and  respectively  are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
these actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors  including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims  trends or changes in claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations 
as a result  actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period i n which the change in estimate occurs 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes  we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment amounts in millions balance as of march  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques 
goodwill impairment testing 
our goodwill balance  million as of march   is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of the end of february  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units for example  similar products and or services  similar long term financial results  product processes  classes of customers  etc we have four reporting units  only two of which have goodwill 
our duff norton reporting unit and rest of products reporting unit have goodwill totaling million and million at march   respectively 
during fiscal  we tested goodwill for impairment as of september  for the duff norton reporting units because key performance indicators for this reporting unit were below budget and prior year levels 
accordingly  we performed step i impairment testing as of the end of the second quarter 
step i testing was not considered necessary for our other reporting unit with goodwill because  based on testing performed in the prior year  the fair value of the reporting unit sufficiently exceeded book value and no new risks of impairment existed at september  based on our assessment as of september   the fair value of the duff norton reporting unit exceeded its net book value by  as such  no impairment charges related to goodwill or intangible assets were recorded during the six month period ended sep tember  as of december   we concluded that no indicators of goodwill impairment existed  so an interim test was not performed 
as a result of our annual impairment test as of february   the fair market value of our reporting units will goodwill exceeds their net book values and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded 
fair market value of the duff norton and rest of the products reporting units exceeded net book value by approximately and  respectively 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors 
the key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections was approximately 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years which reflects our estimate of long term gross domestic product growth on a global basis 
operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms by between fiscal and fiscal in the individual reporting units 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the consolidated company was determined to be based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix  their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization 
we also consider any additional risk of each individual reporting unit achieving its forecasts  and adjust the weighted average cost of capital applied when determining each reporting unit s estimated fair value 
the weighted average cost of capital determined for each reporting unit as of the february  test date ranged between and 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
for example  a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than basis points would decrease fair market value by million and million for the duff norton reporting unit and rest of the products reporting unit  respectively  or an in crease in the weighted average cost of capital by basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by million and million for the duff norton reporting unit and rest of the products reporting units  respectively 
even with such changes fair value of the reporting units would be greater than the net book value necessitating no step calculations 
while we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units with goodwill are at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
but if the projected long term revenue growth rates  profit margins  or terminal rates are significantly lower  and or the estimated weighted average cost of capital is considerably higher  future testing may indicate impairment of one or more of the company s reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill may likely be impaired 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
we also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   we had million of gross deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to consolidated financial statements  the deferred tax assets relate principally to net operating loss carryforwards primarily due to a tax loss from sale of a foreign subsidiary in and restructuring costs in and liabilities related to employee benefit plans and insurance reserves 
the deferred tax assets include million related to various states and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded 
accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
management assesses the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets periodically 
in assessing the requirement for  and amount of  a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard  we give appropriate consideration to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
under the accounting rules  this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our exper ience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
forecast of future profitability were a significant consideration in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets at march  based on our assessment  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient us profitability during the remaining nol and tax credit carryforward periods years to realize substantially all of the economic value of the federal nols and some of the state nols before they expire 
if the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated or if actual future profitability is considerably less than what we are currently anticipating  or if taxable income is not generated in fiscal  a valuation allowance may need to be recorded for some or all of the net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction of net income and shareowners eq uity 
in order to recover all of the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating losses  taxable income approximating million will need to be generated during the carryover period 
the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
if we were to experience an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed nol carryforward period 
the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or loss es held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  the united kingdom  france  hungary and germany and sell our products in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese yuan 
for example  when the us dollar weakens against the euro  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in euros increases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relatio n to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
during  the company entered into cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forward agreements to hedge changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of these derivatives is million and all contracts mature by september  as of march   the fair value of these derivatives was a million loss that was recorded to earnings and is included in foreign currency exchange loss 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  respectively 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million in fiscal and like many industrial manufacturers  we are involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos related liability  we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  our recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against us  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any cer tainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  we have estimated our asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between million and million using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of to years 
our estimation of our asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles approximates million which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of march  the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation 
this liability may fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  i ncluding the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on our financial condition or our liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period

controls and procedures management s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of march   an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
based on that evaluation  our management  including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of march  there were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors during our fourth quarter ended march  management s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  as such term is defined in exchange act rules a f and d f 
under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  based on the framework in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
based on that evaluation  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of march  has been audited by ernst young llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  as stated in their report which is included herein 
our management  including the ceo and cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
further  because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in d ecision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
changes in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting 
report of ernst young llp  independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders of columbus mckinnon corporation we have audited columbus mckinnon corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 
columbus mckinnon corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations o f management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  columbus mckinnon corporation maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on the coso criteria 
we have also audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of columbus mckinnon corporation as of march  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended march  of columbus mckinnon corporation and our report dated may  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon
