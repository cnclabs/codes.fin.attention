income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate in approximates the rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates 
however  a reversal of a portion of the accounting standards codification asc liability described in note  due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  lowered tax expense in the twelve months ending december  commitments and contingencies all dollars in thousands commitments under a number of indemnity agreements between the company and each of its officers and directors  the company has agreed to indemnify each of its officers and directors against any liability asserted against them in their capacity as an officer or director  or both 
the company s indemnity obligations under the indemnity agreements are subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each of the agreements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is contingently liable for costs which may be incurred by the officers and directors in connection with claims arising by reason of these individuals roles as officers and directors 
the company has entered into salary continuation agreements with two employees  which provide for monthly payments to each of the employees or his designated beneficiary upon the employee s retirement or death 
the payment benefits range from per month to per month with the term of such payments limited to years after the employee s retirement at age the agreements also provide for survivorship benefits if the employee dies before attaining age  and severance payments if the employee is terminated without cause  the amount of which is dependent on the length of company service at the date of termination 
the net present value of the retirement payments is included in other long term liabilities  and amounted to at december  and at december   respectively 
the company has obtained and is the beneficiary of three whole life insurance policies in respect of the two employees discussed above  and one other policy 
the cash surrender value of such policies included in other assets amounts to at december  and at december   respectively 
contingencies the company s general liability insurance policies are subject to deductibles or retentions and amounts ranging from to  subject to an agreed aggregate 
the company is insured on a first dollar basis for workers compensation subject to statutory limits 
the company is not presently involved in any litigation that it believes could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
warranty commitments gas transmission products such as those made by the company carry potentially serious personal injury risks in the event of failures in the field 
as a result  the company has extensive internal testing and other quality control procedures and historically the company has not had a meaningful failure rate in the field due to the extensive nature of these quality controls 
due to the company s quality systems  the warranty expense is de minimis  and accordingly  the company does not maintain a warranty reserve beyond a nominal amount 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
historically low interest rates and easy availability of credit  contributed to construction activity in recent years 
there are a number of factors in the current economy that are reducing the demand for residential  commercial and institutional construction 
these factors include the crisis in the financial markets has reduced the availability of financing for new construction  foreclosures have increased the inventory of available residential housing  thereby decreasing the demand for new construction  and consumer demand has declined as a result of reduced economic activity 
initiatives by the federal government to stabilize the residential housing markets and stimulate the economy  and lower interest rates  may act to increase residential construction activity  but it is possible that those initiatives will take some time to have an appreciable effect  or they may not be effective in stabilizing or stimulating the economy  or may be rescinded altogether 
the reductions in residential construction activity may materially adversely affect the company s revenues 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe and counterstrike products are used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global warming phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs  but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company occasionally enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price or range of prices 
these agreements require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
it is possible that prices may decrease below the fixed prices agreed upon and therefore require the company to pay more than market price  potentially materially 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has a  line of credit outstanding with sovereign bank  na with a interest rate floor 
interest rates are also significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry  since interest rates can be a determinant factor on whether or not borrowing funds for building will be affordable to our customers 
see construction activity  above any dramatic change to interest rates could therefore have a detrimental effect 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates all amounts in thousands financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable valuations  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  workers compensation claims reserves  and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe 
under generally accepted accounting principles  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist 
delivery has occurred or services rendered 
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable 
collection is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles 
gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the company 
this includes promotional incentives  year end rebates  and discounts 
the amounts of certain incentives are estimated at the time of sale 
commissions  for which the company receives an identifiable benefit  are accounted for as a sales expense 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years usage  measured on a historical usage basis  to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  the company ceased recording amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  the company performed annual impairment tests in accordance with this guidance as of december  and december  these analyses did not indicate any impairment of goodwill 
product liability reserves as explained more fully under contingencies  the company retains some liability for various product liability claims on a per occurrence basis under its general liability insurance policies  ranging from to  depending on the policy year 
to date  the company has not experienced a meaningful product failure rate 
workers compensation claims reserves prior to the spin off  the company provided workers compensation coverage principally through commercial insurance carriers using high deductible programs  which required the company to reserve for and pay a high proportion of its workers compensation claims payable and to rely upon the expertise of its insurance carriers and its own historical experience in setting the reserves related to these claims 
one such workers compensation claim is still outstanding from the pre spin off period for which the company remains liable for amounts up to the deductible 
the company maintains a reserve for these amounts 
the remaining potential liability is minimal  as this case is reaching the maximum deductible 
the company is insured on a first dollar basis 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for federal tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic under this method the company recorded tax expense and related deferred taxes and tax benefits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources all dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  the company s cash balance at december  was  compared to  at december   which represents a decrease of  between periods 
the decrease in cash is primarily attributed to a two dollar per share dividend  amounting to  as well as a  loan to a related party mestek  inc  which is disclosed as a note receivable in the consolidated financial statements  and is to be paid back to the company no later than october offsetting to those outflows  the company borrowed  in december from sovereign bank under a  line of credit facility 
operations also generated cash  with net income for the year of  another main contributor was cash savings during the year due to reduced inventory purchases  as demonstrated by the  decrease in inventory between years 
all of these components along with other non material variables contributed to the company s ability to generate cash 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was higher in  than in  going from  to  the company was able to purchase less inventory during the current year  which reduced cash requirements by  inventory turned times in  and times in  with the lag being caused primarily by the reduction in sales between and  partially offset by the reduction in inventory purchases previously mentioned 
the company also saved  related to other liabilities  since the prior year included the final payments of  related to the legal settlement described in detail in the form k  under note  commitments and contingencies  and a good portion of the remainder due to the diminished requirement for incentive compensation in in contrast  the operations of the company earned net income of  in versus  in  a decrease of  which had a negative impact on cash 
further  a decrease in sales during the year also carried through to receivables  which shows a depletion in cash receipts of  when comparing to cash provided for accounts payable was also unfavorable  as it was higher by  in  with about of that amount due to a raw material settlement payment in  which had been accrued in investing activities cash used in investing activities for was  which includes a  loan to our former parent company mestek  inc  detailed in note  compared with  provided in the company expects the collection of the  mestek note in october of there are currently no other known trends  demands  commitments or uncertainties that the company anticipates will significantly increase or decrease liquidity 
capital spending was and for and  respectively 
financing cash used in financing activities during was  compared with  used in each year had significant dividend payments 
in  the company paid  in dividends  while also borrowing  from its line of credit to fund a portion of that payment 
in  the company paid two dividends amounting to  on september   the company s board of directors authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program for an additional months 
the original program established in september of authorized the purchase of up to  of its common stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market and business conditions 
the board retained the right to cancel  extend  or expand the share buyback program at any time and from time to time 
during  the company had purchased  shares of treasury stock for on december   the company agreed to a revolving line of credit note and a loan agreement with sovereign bank  na sovereign 
the company thereby established a line of credit facility in the maximum amount of  maturing on december   with funds available for working capital purposes and to fund dividends 
this supersedes the existing  line of credit the company previously had in place with sovereign 
the loan is collateralized by all of the company s tangible and intangible assets 
the loan agreement provides for the payment of any loan under the agreement at a rate that is either prime rate plus or libor rate plus  with a floor 
the company is also required to pay a commitment fee equal to for the additional  of available funds  and is delegated to pay a line fee equal to basis points of the average unused balance on a quarterly basis 
the company has no other loans or loan balances outstanding 
the company believes its liquidity position as of december  is fully adequate to meet foreseeable future needs and that the company will possess adequate cash reserves to meet its day to day needs including any acquisitions or capital expenditures or stock repurchases it can reasonably foresee at this time
