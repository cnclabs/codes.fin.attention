there is a material difference in the interpretation of the procedure established in clause of attachment b of the guayuyaco association contract 
ecopetrol interprets the contract to provide that the extended test production up to a value equal to of the direct exploration costs of the wells is for ecopetrol s account only and serves as reimbursement of its back in to the guayuyaco discovery 
gran tierra colombia s contention is that this amount is merely the recovery of of the direct exploration costs of the wells and not exclusively for benefit of ecopetrol 
there has been no agreement between the parties  and ecopetrol has filed a lawsuit in the contravention administrative court in the district of cauca regarding this matter 
gran tierra colombia filed a response on april  in which it refuted all of ecopetrol s claims and requested a change of venue to the courts in bogota 
closing arguments were presented by all parties during we are awaiting the courts decision 
at this time no amount has been accrued in the financial statements as gran tierra does not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred 
ecopetrol is claiming damages of approximately million 
we have several other lawsuits and claims pending for which we currently cannot determine the ultimate result 
we record costs as they are incurred or become determinable 
we believe the resolution of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data as set out in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent international energy company incorporated in the united states and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration  development and production 
we are headquartered in calgary  alberta  canada and operate in south america in colombia  argentina and peru  and have a business development office in brazil 
in september  we acquired our initial oil and gas interests and properties  which were in argentina 
during  we increased our oil and gas interests and property base through further acquisitions in colombia  argentina and peru 
we funded acquisitions of our properties in colombia and argentina through a series of private placements of our securities that occurred between september and february and an additional private placement that occurred in june effective november   we completed the acquisition of solana resources limited solana  an international resource company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in colombia and incorporated in alberta  canada 
at the date of acquisition  solana held various working interests in nine blocks in colombia including a working interest in the chaza block  which includes the costayaco field  and a working interest in the guayuyaco block  which includes the juanambu field 
during the third quarter of  we opened a business development office in rio de janeiro  brazil 
the oil and gas industry has been adversely impacted by the downturn in the global economy and the decline in average crude oil prices during as compared to although our revenue has been negatively affected by these lower oil prices  our increase in production has more than offset the impact of these adverse market conditions 
we believe that our current operations and capital expenditure program can be maintained from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand  barring unforeseen events 
we also have the ability to defer or cancel portions of our capital expenditure program should our operating cash flows decline as a result of reductions in crude oil prices 
business strategy our plan is to continue to build an international oil and gas company through acquisition and exploitation of under developed prospective oil and gas assets  and to develop these assets with exploration and development drilling to grow commercial reserves and production 
our initial focus is in select countries in south america  currently colombia  argentina  peru and brazil  other regions will be considered for future growth should those regions make strategic and commercial sense in creating additional value 
we have applied a two stage approach to growth  initially establishing a base of production  development and exploration assets by selective acquisitions  and secondly achieving growth through drilling 
we intend to duplicate this business model in other areas as opportunities arise 
we pursue opportunities in countries with proven petroleum systems  attractive royalty  taxation and other fiscal terms  and stable legal systems 
in the petroleum industry  geologic settings with proven petroleum source rocks  migration pathways  reservoir rocks and traps are referred to as petroleum systems

during the year  our production was disrupted for days from damage to the trans andean pipeline and a general strike at the beginning of january 
revenue and other income increased by from due to increased production partially offset by lower oil prices 
a foreign exchange loss of million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  was recorded in primarily due to the translation of a deferred tax liability recorded on the purchase of solana 
the deferred tax liability is denominated in colombian pesos and the devaluation of in the us dollar against the colombian peso in resulted in the foreign exchange loss 
oil and gas property expenditures for include further development drilling in the costayaco field  including costayaco  costayaco  costayaco  costayaco and costayaco  facility construction in costayaco  the drilling of the puinaves exploration well in the guachiria norte block  the drilling of the dantayaco exploration well in the chaza block  and acquisition of d or d seismic in the guachiria  garibay  rio magdelena  chaza  and san pablo blocks  all in colombia 
our cash position of million excluding restricted cash at december  increased from million at december  as a result of increased cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by capital expenditures 
working capital including cash cash equivalents was million at december   which is an million increase from december   due mainly to increased cash as at december  compared to december  property  plant equipment as at december  was million  a decrease from december   primarily as a result of increased depletion  depreciation and accretion dd a  partially offset by capital additions 
dd a for included a million ceiling test impairment loss in our argentina cost center 
operational highlights for the year ended december  costayaco field oil production milestones at the end of august  we reached our daily gross production plateau target for the costayaco field in colombia 
in addition  production from the costayaco field reached five million cumulative barrels of gross oil production on september  triggering additional government royalties 
successful production testing of costayaco  costayaco and costayaco in june  we completed logging operations and initiated production testing of costayaco testing of costayaco was completed in early july and the well came on production later in the month 
in september  we completed logging operations and production testing of costayaco testing of costayaco was completed in early september and the well was tied in and put on production later in the month 
in december  we completed logging operations and production testing of costayaco  the well was tied in and put on production at the beginning of january costayaco and were tested and suspended 
successful production testing of valle morado well in argentina in november  we commenced an extended production test on the vm 
x discovery well in the valle morado field in argentina 
the well was tested at approximately million standard cubic feet per day mmscf day of natural gas with approximately  barrels of water per day  the estimated wellhead flowing pressure was  pounds per square inch psi 
we have a gas sales contract to sell up to mmscf day of gas at per million british thermal units mmbtu until the commencement of a planned workover for the well in july new exploration and exploitation contracts in colombia in june  we signed three exploration and exploitation contracts with the national hydrocarbon agency totaling  acres in which we have a working interest 
the piedemonte norte block lies southwest of the chaza block where the costayaco field is located 
the piedemonte sur block is located immediately west of the orito field  the largest oil field in the putumayo basin

consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  as a result of the solana acquisition  we increased our working interest to in the costayaco field and in the juanambu field  in colombia  which resulted in increased production  revenue  operating costs  and dd a in net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  was recorded in compared to million  or per share basic and per share diluted  in a foreign exchange loss of million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  an increase of million in dd a to million  higher operating and general and administrative expenses  and increased income tax expense  more than offset the higher oil revenues in revenue and interest increased to million in compared to million in this was due to an increase of in crude oil production partially offset by a decrease in crude oil prices 
crude oil and ngl production  net after royalties  in increased to million barrels compared to million barrels in  due mainly to increased production from our colombia operations 
average realized crude oil prices for decreased to per barrel from per barrel in  reflecting lower west texas intermediate wti oil prices 
operating expenses for amounted to million  a increase from the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses is due to expanded operations and increased production levels in colombia 
however  operating expenses on a boe basis in were per boe  a decline from reflecting a reduction in fixed costs per barrel due to production increases at costayaco 
dd a expense for increased to million compared to million in increased production levels  as well as amortization expense of million in million in related to the fair value of property  plant and equipment recorded on the acquisition of solana  accounted for the increases 
on a boe basis  dd a in was compared to for this increase was primarily due to the significant additions to the proved depletable cost base resulting from the solana acquisition partially offset by higher proved reserves in colombia 
dd a for included a million ceiling test impairment loss in our argentina cost center 
this impairment loss resulted from higher estimated future operating costs to produce remaining reserves 
general and administrative g a expenses of million for was higher than due to increased employee related costs reflecting the expanded operations in colombia 
however  due to higher production in  g a expenses per boe decreased to per boe compared to per boe for the foreign exchange loss of million for  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  compares to million recorded in these losses primarily represent foreign exchange losses resulting from the translation of a deferred tax liability recorded on the purchase of solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of colombia and as a result  foreign exchange gains and losses have been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
income tax expense for amounted to million compared to million recorded in this represents an increase of in annual income tax expense  primarily due to an increase in foreign currency translation losses that are neither taxable nor deductible for tax purposes in each of the respective jurisdictions 
the increase in the effective tax rate to from in is primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance associated with increased losses in our us  canadian and peru business units 
the variance from the us statutory rate for results from an increase in the valuation allowances as described above  and the recapture of enhanced tax depreciation incentive in colombia  due to a disposal of assets during the year  offset by enhanced tax depreciation taken on oil and gas capital expenditures 
the variance from the us statutory rate for is primarily attributable to recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits  foreign currency translation fluctuations that are not taxable or deductible in the related foreign jurisdictions  and valuation allowances taken on losses incurred in the us  canada  and peru 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  in  a increase in crude oil production and a increase in realized prices of crude oil were the major contributing factors to net income of million compared to a net loss of million recorded in our revenue and interest increased to million in compared to due to increased production and higher crude oil prices 
crude oil and ngl production in increased to  barrels compared to  barrels in due to the inclusion of a full year of production from the costayaco and juanambu fields in colombia 
these fields were discovered in and the discovery wells came on production during the second half of in  we drilled and completed four development wells at costayaco and these wells were put on production during the course of the year 
average realized crude oil prices increased to per barrel from per barrel in reflecting the high wti oil prices experienced during the first three quarters of solana properties also contributed to the overall production levels since acquisition 
operating expenses for amounted to million  an increase from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the increased production in colombia as well as the addition of the post acquisition operating expenses of solana which amounted to million 
however  in  the new fields in colombia with high production wells and lower operating expenses resulted in operating expenses of per boe  a decline from in  higher production levels as well as the amortization of million related to the recording of solana s property  plant and equipment at fair value resulted in a increase in dd a to million 
a increase in the average depletion rate to per boe in was primarily due to the significant additions to the proved depletable cost base partially offset by higher proved reserves in colombia 
g a expenses of million for was higher than due to increased salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of million mainly as a result of the expanded operations in colombia and the option grants  as well as higher corporate stewardship costs including sarbanes oxley compliance requirements and ongoing expenses related to securities registration 
the foreign exchange loss of million for compares to a  foreign exchange gain recorded in the losses in primarily represent foreign exchange losses resulting from the translation of a deferred tax liability recorded on the purchase of solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of colombia and as a result  foreign exchange gains and losses have been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
other expenses in represent a derivative financial instruments gain of million from the costless collar financial derivative contract for crude oil prices entered into pursuant to the terms and conditions of gran tierra s credit facility 
other expenses in comprised mainly liquidated damages of million and financial derivatives losses of million 
liquidated damages represented damages payable to stockholders as a result of certain registration statements not becoming effective within the periods specified in the share registration rights agreements for the underlying securities 
there were no liquidated damages in income tax expense for amounted to million compared to million recorded in the increase resulted primarily from the colombian operations which generated net income before taxes of million in compared to million recorded in we used additional colombian tax deductions associated with capital investment in producing oil and natural gas properties to decrease our current income tax otherwise payable by approximately million 
the tax expense related to our colombian operating segment was million  offset by a recovery of million for our argentina segment 
estimated oil and gas reserves estimated proved oil reserves  net of royalties  as of december   were million barrels  a increase from the estimated proved reserves as at december  the increase resulted from our successful development drilling program in colombia which led to conversion of probable reserves to proved and which more than offset production of oil 
estimated probable and possible oil reserves  net of royalties  as of december   were million barrels and million barrels  respectively 
estimated proved gas reserves  net of royalties  as of december   were billion cubic feet bcf  a increase from the estimated proved reserves as at december  the increase resulted from our successful testing of the vm 
x discovery well in the valle morado field in argentina 
estimated probable and possible gas reserves  net of royalties  as of december   were bcf and bcf  respectively 
the estimated proved reserves as at december  of million barrels  increased by compared with year end reserve levels 
the increase resulted from our successful development drilling program in colombia which led to the discoveries in costayaco and juanambu fields and the addition of crude oil reserves associated with the acquisition of solana 
the new discoveries in colombia contributed approximately million barrels of oil to our reserve base and the acquisition of solana contributed approximately million barrels 
segmented results of operations our operations are carried out in colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil  and we are headquartered in calgary  alberta  canada

gran tierra changed from the conversion of gas volumes to boe at a rate of mcf of gas per barrel of oil to provide volume information consistent with standard industry practice and to reflect natural gas s relative energy content to a barrel of oil 
as a result  the boe volumes presented have increased by  boe from those volumes previously disclosed

segmented results of operations colombia for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before income taxes from colombia amounted to million compared to income before taxes of million recorded in an increase in production revenue was more than offset by increased expenses including a million increase in foreign exchange loss to million  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  primarily due to the translation of deferred taxes 
also  a million increase in dd a  primarily a result of the amortization of the fair value of solana s property  plant and equipment recorded upon our acquisition of solana  partially offset the increase in production revenue 
higher operating expenses due to increased colombian production and increased general and administrative expenses from expanded activities also contributed to a reduction in income before income taxes 
for the year ended december   production of crude oil and ngls  net after royalties  increased by to million barrels compared to million barrels in the incremental production volumes from solana properties for the year ended december  were million barrels of oil  compared to  barrels of oil in these production levels are after government royalties ranging from to and third party royalties of to 
gran tierra s colombian operating results for the year ended december  are principally impacted by the inclusion of production from three new development wells in the costayaco field  including solana s share of production from costayaco  and solana s share of production from juanambu in the guayuyaco block 
in  colombia production included production from costayaco      and juanambu along with production from the santana block 
our production in and was impacted by political and economic factors in colombia 
in the second and third quarter of  and the first and second quarter of  sections of the ecopetrol operated trans andean pipeline were damaged  which temporarily reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol 
on november   we temporarily suspended production operations in the costayaco and juanambu oil fields 
this was as a result of a declaration of a state of emergency and force majeure by ecopetrol  due to a general strike in the region where our operations are located 
on january   crude oil transportation resumed in southern colombia as a result of the lifting of the strike at the orito facilities operated by ecopetrol 
as a result of these factors  deliveries to ecopetrol in were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days between july and august  and reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days in june  and we were shut in for the first days of january 
during the first quarter of  deliveries to ecopetrol were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days and in the second quarter of deliveries were reduced to approximately  bopd  net after royalties  for days 
revenue and interest were negatively impacted by a decline in net realized crude oil prices in compared to the average net realized prices for crude oil  which are based on wti prices  decreased by to per barrel for the year ended december  compared to however  substantially increased production resulted in our revenue and interest from colombia for the year ended december  increasing by to million from as a result of achieving gross field production of five million barrels in our costayaco field during the month of september  gran tierra is now subject to an additional government royalty payable 
this royalty is calculated on of the field production revenue over an inflation adjusted trigger point 
that trigger point for gran tierra was for production revenue for this calculation is based on production volumes net of other government royalty volumes 
average government royalties at costayaco with gross production of  bopd and wti per barrel are approximately  including the additional government royalty of approximately 
the national hydrocarbons agency sliding scale royalty at  bopd is approximately and this royalty is deductible prior to calculating the additional government royalty 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increased operating expenses resulted from the increase in production and the inclusion of the solana operations acquired on november  however  on a per boe basis  operating expenses for declined to compared to incurred in  reflecting the reduction of fixed operating costs per barrel as total production increased 
for  dd a expense increased to million from million in increased production levels coupled with a higher depletable cost base resulting from the solana acquisition  partially offset by higher crude oil reserve levels  accounted for the increase in dd a expense 
the incremental dd a expense recorded as a result of the solana acquisition was million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded in on a per boe basis  the dd a expense in colombia increased by to for  compared with for  due to the higher depletable cost base reflecting the solana properties recorded at fair value upon acquisition  partially offset by increased proved reserves 
higher g a expenses incurred to manage the increased level of development and operating activities  the solana acquired properties  and increased stock based compensation expense resulted in g a expense increasing to million for the year ended december  from million incurred in on a per boe basis  g a expense in decreased by to from in  due to higher production 
the foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  includes an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss of million which resulted primarily from the translation of a deferred tax liability recognized on the purchase of solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations and as a result  foreign exchange gains and losses have been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
a strengthening in the colombian peso against the us dollar results in foreign exchange losses  estimated at  for each one peso decrease in the exchange rate of the colombian peso to one us dollar 
segmented results of operations colombia for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before income taxes from colombia amounted to million compared to million recorded in  primarily the result of increased production of crude oil and higher net realized prices partially offset by increased operating expenses  dd a and g a 
on a per barrel basis  the pre tax income for was versus recorded in the prior year 
in  production of crude oil and ngl increased by to  barrels compared to  barrels in these production levels are after government royalties ranging from to and third party royalties of to 
gran tierra s colombian operating results for are principally impacted by new oil production resulting from the success of our exploration program  undertaken in the first half of  where we made two field discoveries  costayaco in the chaza block and juanambu in the guayuyaco block 
production from these discoveries commenced in the third quarter of and has increased during as the result of development drilling  and with the addition of production from the costayaco   and wells during the course of our production is also impacted by political and economic factors in colombia 
in the first quarter of  sections of one of the ecopetrol pipelines were damaged  which temporarily reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol 
ecopetrol was able to restore deliveries within one to two weeks of these incidents 
on november   we temporarily suspended production operations in the costayaco and juanambu oil fields 
this was as a result of a declaration of a state of emergency and force majeure by ecopetrol  due to a general strike in the region where our operations are located  resulting in higher than average colombia crude oil inventories at december  on january   crude oil transportation resumed in southern colombia as a result of the lifting of the strike at the orito facilities operated by ecopetrol 
the incremental production volume from solana properties for the period from the acquisition date of november  to december  was  barrels of oil and  mcf of natural gas  and was severely impacted by the general strike affecting the two major producing fields of costayaco and juanambu 
revenue and interest were positively impacted by significantly improved net realized crude oil prices 
the average net realized prices for crude oil  which are based on wti prices  increased by to per barrel in the combination of increased production and higher realized prices resulted in our revenue levels from colombia in increasing by to million 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in the increased operating expenses resulted from the increase in production  inclusion of post acquisition operating expenses of solana which amounted to million and the increased cost associated with trucking oil from costayaco to our pipeline 
however  the increased production resulted in a reduction of operating expenses on a per barrel basis to in compared to per barrel incurred in for  dd a increased to million from million recorded in increased production levels coupled with a higher depletable cost base including solana properties  partially offset by higher reserve levels  accounted for the increase in dd a 
the incremental dd a recorded as a result of the solana acquisition was million 
although our colombian proved reserves increased significantly in and as a result of our successful exploration and development activities  we also invested much of our and capital spending on the colombian development program 
our acquisition of solana in the fourth quarter of further increased our proved reserves and our depletable cost base 
thus  the increase in dd a was due to the significant increases in the depletable basis for the fair value of the solana proved reserves acquired and future capital expenditures associated with the development of the undeveloped proved reserves at december  these future capital expenditures were for further development well drilling and related infrastructure costs to deliver the increased production volumes from costayaco 
on a per boe basis  the dd a in colombia for was  essentially unchanged from due to the significant increase in proved reserves offsetting the impact of a higher depletable cost pool 
higher management and administrative expenses incurred to manage the increased level of development and operating activities resulting from the successful exploration and development activities resulted in g a expense increasing to million in from million incurred in on a per boe basis  the g a expense decreased by to for other items in include a foreign exchange loss of million which primarily resulted from the translation of a deferred tax liability recognized on the purchase of solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of the foreign operations and as a result  a foreign exchange loss has been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
capital program colombia gran tierra s focus for was to continue with the development of the costayaco field to increase our production and reserves  in addition to undertaking additional oil exploration efforts to further define the potential of our acreage in colombia 
in support of this strategy  our capital expenditures in colombia amounted to million for the year ended december  segmented capital expenditures colombia year ended december  block and activity millions of us dollars chaza drilled and tested costayaco     commenced drilling of costayaco  drilled dantayaco  commenced d seismic program  installed facilities and equipment rio magdalena completion and long term testing of popa well and d kilometers km seismic program guachiria completed acquisition of square kilometers km of d seismic guachiria norte drilling of the puinaves exploration well  which was dry guachiria sur completed acquisition of km of d seismic garibay completed acquisition of km of d seismic azar commencement of d and d seismic programs guayayaco juanambu production separator leasehold improvements capitalized g a and other segmented capital expenditures colombia for comparison  for the year ended december   we spent million on capital projects

principal terms included consideration of million between the third party and gran tierra s subsidiary  solana  comprising an initial cash payment of million at closing  followed by monthly installments of  each beginning june  and extending through august   less settlement of outstanding amounts 
the sale closed on april  and gran tierra recorded net proceeds of million 
gran tierra retained a overriding royalty interest on the guachiria sur block  which  in the event of a discovery  is designed to reimburse of our costs for previously acquired seismic data 
during the year ended december   we spent million on capital projects 
our focus in was on exploration drilling and we drilled six wells during the year 
we drilled successful wells in the chaza and guayuyaco areas and in march we drilled the juanambu well and encountered hydrocarbon shows in four zones 
testing established the presence of a significant oil accumulation 
we drilled and tested the costayaco well  which also indicated a significant accumulation of oil in a number of zones 
consequently  our proven reserves in colombia substantially increased 
we put these wells on production in the third quarter of we drilled the juanambu and costayaco wells and commenced drilling of costayaco for a net cost of million 
we drilled four other exploration wells in comprising the laura exploration well in the talora block in january  the caneyes exploration well in the rio magdalena block in february  and the soyona and cachapa exploration wells in the primavera block in april and march  respectively 
these wells were plugged and abandoned 
we drilled the caneyes well at a net cost to us of million and the drilling costs for the three other wells were paid by our partners 
during  we incurred costs of million on other projects including million for completion of a d seismic program in costayaco to optimize positioning of future drilling locations and million related to a d seismic program in the rio magdalena block 
we also relinquished ownership of the primavera block and acquired the putumayo a and b technical evaluation areas

gran tierra changed from the conversion of gas volumes to boe at a rate of mcf of gas per barrel of oil to provide volume information consistent with standard industry practice and to reflect natural gas s relative energy content to a barrel of oil 
as a result  the boe volumes presented have increased by  boe from those volumes previously disclosed 
natural gas liquids ngl volumes are converted to boe on a one to one basis with oil

segmented results of operations argentina for the year ended december  compared to the results for the year ended december  and compared to the results for the year ended december  for the fiscal year  the pre tax loss from argentina was million compared to pre tax losses of million and million recorded in fiscal years and  respectively  due to higher production levels offset partially by increased depletion 
dd a for included a million ceiling test impairment loss in our argentina cost center 
this impairment loss resulted from an increase in estimated future operating costs to produce remaining proved reserves 
crude oil and ngl production  net after royalties  increased to  barrels in compared to  barrels in and  barrels in the increase resulted from the successful completion and testing of the proa exploration well in the surubi block in the third quarter of with sales commencing in the fourth quarter of that year 
due to the local regulatory regimes  the price we currently receive for production from our blocks is approximately per barrel 
furthermore  currently all oil and gas producers in argentina are operating without sales contracts 
a new withholding tax regime was introduced in argentina without specific guidance as to its application 
producers and refiners of oil in argentina have been unable to determine an agreed sales price for oil deliveries to refineries 
along with most other oil producers in argentina we are continuing deliveries to the refineries and are negotiating a price for deliveries made after december  we are working with other oil and gas producers in the area  as well as refiner sa  to lobby the federal government for change 
with regulated crude oil prices  the change in our revenues over the three year period has been reflective of changes in our production levels 
revenues of million generated in compares to million in and million in the argentine secretariat of energy has awarded gran tierra argentina with million of petroleum plus program fiscal credits due to our fourth quarter production growth 
the program implements a system of fiscal credits calculated on two different performance based criteria production growth and replacement of total proved reserves  both over an established baseline calculation of production additions and reserve replacement 
the fiscal credits are intended to be applied against export taxes 
the program was effective october  and fiscal credits are awarded quarterly to companies meeting the criteria on a look back basis 
annual requalification for the petroleum plus program requires reserves replacement 
as our argentina subsidiary is not an exporter of oil  we are in the process of identifying argentine oil exporters who may wish to purchase this credit 
gran tierra considers the petroleum plus credits to be a contingent gain and therefore no fiscal credits have been recorded in the financial statements 
petroleum plus fiscal credits will be recorded when they are received and subsequently sold to an argentine oil exporter 
amounts earned from fiscal credits are fully taxable 
operating expenses for the year ended december   increased slightly to million per boe compared to million per boe and million per boe  respectively  incurred in and higher production volumes from proa in the surubi block  in the comparative periods  resulted in the significant reductions in the operating costs per boe 
dd a expense for was million compared to million in and million in on a per boe basis  dd a for the year ended december  increased to from and  respectively  recorded in and the impact of higher production levels and lower proved reserves was partially offset by a decreasing proved depletable cost base 
this decreasing proved depletable cost base is a result of reduced development expenditures in argentina 
in addition  dd a for included a million ceiling test impairment loss in our argentina cost center 
this impairment loss resulted from higher forecasted operating costs to produce remaining proved reserves 
capital program argentina capital expenditures in amounted to million mainly related to workovers  facility construction  and the acquisition of seismic 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   amounted to million and included drilling of the proa discovery well on the surubi block for a net cost of million

this compares to a gain of million  and a million loss from derivative financial instruments  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these gains and losses are based on the effects of changing wti crude oil price  and forward price curves used to fair value the costless collar at the respective year ends 
liquidated damages liquidated damages of million in fiscal year relate to liquidated damages payable to gran tierra s stockholders as a result of the registration statement for million units sold in the second quarter of not becoming effective within the period specified in the share registration rights agreements for those securities 
this registration statement became effective on may  and no additional liquidated damages were incurred after that time 
on june   under the terms of the registration rights agreements  we obtained a sufficient number of consents from the signatories to the agreements waiving our obligation to pay in cash the accrued liquidated damages 
we agreed to amend the terms of the warrants issued in the offering by reducing the exercise price of the warrants from to and extending the life of the warrants by one year 
the amendment to the terms of the warrants was reflected as an increase of million in the value of warrants representing the fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model using inputs similar to those used for the company s other equity instruments issued 
the remaining million liquidated damages settled through this warrant modification was recorded to paid in capital 
liquidated damages of million were expensed in the results of operations of which million was recorded in the first quarter of foreign exchange loss gain the foreign exchange loss gain results from the translation of foreign currency denominated transactions to us dollars 
capital program corporate the capital expenditures for the corporate segment during the year ended december  were million 
these expenditures included million for peru on our exploration blocks and for drilling feasibility and geological studies 
the capital expenditures of million for the corporate segment included expenditures of million for peru on our exploration blocks and acquisition of technical data through aeromagnetic gravity studies began in  and was completed in the first half of  with a total of  kilometers of data acquired over both blocks 
in  we started environmental impact assessments and the community consultation process on both blocks 
these projects were completed in  along with drilling feasibility and geological studies 
in  capital expenditures of million were primarily related to peru and included technical studies of block and block and the initiation of an aero magnetic and gravity survey over both blocks 
this program commenced in the fourth quarter of and was completed in fourth quarter results the following table provides an analysis of quarterly financial information in thousands of dollars except production  per share and per boe amounts for the three months ended december  compared to the same period in three months ended december  selected quarterly financial information production barrels of oil equivalent per day per boe prices realized revenue and other income expenses income loss before income tax income tax expense net income loss basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share for the three months ended december   gran tierra recorded net income of million per share basic and per share diluted compared to a loss of million loss of per share  basic and diluted recorded in the same period last year 
the fourth quarter net income was positively impacted by the increase in production and higher crude oil prices  partially offset by the increase in expenses related to expanded operations 
fourth quarter results were affected by the temporary suspension of production in two major producing fields in colombia 
as a result  incremental revenues contributed by solana in were marginal due to the suspension of the production in the fields which represent solana s major producing properties 
revenue and other income for the fourth quarter of amounted to million  an increase of from the same quarter last year 
higher production levels and improved crude oil prices contributed to this significant increase 
production of crude oil increased by to  barrels per day from  barrels per day in the last quarter of the positive effect of this increase in production was offset slightly by the decline in crude oil prices 
average prices per barrel of oil increased by to in the fourth quarter of from realized in the same quarter last year 
the fourth quarter production levels in were also adversely impacted by the temporary suspension of production operations in the costayaco and juanambu oil fields on november  this was as a result of a declaration of a state of emergency and force majeure by ecopetrol  due to a general strike in the putumayo region where our costayaco field and our guayuyaco and santana producing blocks are located 
on january   crude oil transportation resumed in southern colombia as a result of the lifting of the strike at the orito facilities operated by ecopetrol 
the suspension also negatively affected the expected incremental contribution of production from solana s interest in the costayaco field 
the increase in expenses between the two quarters was associated with the expanded activities of gran tierra as well as the additional solana expenses recorded subsequent to the acquisition of solana on november  dd a expense between the two quarters also increased significantly due to higher production levels and the increased depletion base resulting from recording the fair values of property  plant and equipment acquired from solana 
furthermore  dd a for included a million ceiling test impairment loss in our argentina cost center as previously discussed 
the comparative results between the two quarters were also affected by a foreign exchange gain of million recorded in the three months ended december  compared with a foreign exchange loss of million recorded in the same quarter of the previous year 
these foreign exchange gains and losses related to unrealized non cash foreign exchange gains or losses resulting primarily from the translation to us dollars of a colombian pesos denominated deferred tax liability recognized on the purchase of solana 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december   and million at december  we believe that our cash position  together with positive cash flow from operations and no debt  will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our strategic objectives and fund our planned capital program for at least the next months 
in accordance with our investment policy  cash balances are invested only in united states or canadian government backed federal  provincial or state securities with the highest credit ratings and short term liquidity 
we believe that our current financial position provides us the flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions 
gran tierra believes that it has sufficient available cash and cash flow from operations to cover its expected funding needs on both a short term and long term basis 
if the need were to arise  gran tierra believes that it could access short term debt markets  to fund its short term requirements and to ensure near term liquidity 
gran tierra regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and  in the future  may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources 
gran tierra s long term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its long term growth strategy 
effective february   we entered into a credit facility with standard bank plc 
as a result of re negotiations concluded in august  the maximum amount of the credit facility was increased to million with a million borrowing base that could be re determined semi annually based on reserve evaluation reports  but the maturity date was not extended 
as a result of standard bank plc s review of gran tierra s independent reserve audit  we had the capacity to increase the borrowing base to million under the revised facility  however  this was not pursued further as the additional borrowing base was not required 
the facility included a letter of credit sub limit of million 
amounts drawn down under the facility bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus 
a stand by fee of per annum was charged on the un drawn amount of the borrowing base 
the facility is secured primarily by the assets of gran tierra colombia and solana petroleum exploration colombia ltd 
under the terms of the facility  gran tierra is required to maintain and was in compliance with specified financial and operating covenants 
gran tierra was required to enter into a derivative instrument for the purpose of obtaining protection against fluctuations in the price of oil in respect of at least of the june  independent reserve evaluation report projected aggregate net share of colombian production after royalties for the three year term of the facility 
as at december   no amount was drawn down under this facility 
the forgoing facility expired february  gran tierra is negotiating a facility with a major bank to replace the expired facility and we currently intend to have this facility in place by the second quarter of cash flows during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million as cash inflows from operations of million and from financing activities of million more than offset cash outflows for investing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was affected by the significant increase in crude oil production partially offset by the decrease in oil prices and increase in receivables related to oil sales 
the acquisition of solana along with the additional production from three new development wells in colombia contributed to the increased production 
this increased oil revenue from higher production volumes and a higher fourth quarter average oil price received  as compared to the same quarter of the prior year  has resulted in our accounts receivable increasing from the year end 
this has been more than offset by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at year end as a result of increased capital investment in oil and gas projects in colombia 
in addition  in december  our operations in colombia were significantly restricted due to a general strike which reduced our year end accounts receivable 
as previously discussed  the increase in oil and gas property expenditures primarily relate to continued development of our costayaco field in colombia and the identification of new exploration prospects in all business units resulting in the increase in cash used for investing activities 
cash provided by financing activities relates to the exercise of outstanding warrants and employee stock options 
for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million due to positive cash inflows from operations of million  from investing activities of million and from financing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was positively affected by the significant increases in crude oil production and prices as well as collection of receivables assumed as part of the solana acquisition and an increase in current income taxes payable related to gran tierra s taxable position in colombia 
cash inflows from investing activities included million assumed on the purchase of solana  net of acquisition costs  offset by million in capital expenditures related to our exploration and development and other oilfield related activities net of the change in the related non cash working capital 
cash inflows from financing activities of million related to the proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents declined by million as a positive cash contribution from operations of million was more than offset by funds of million net of changes in related non cash working capital expended in our capital expenditure program for our drilling and other oilfield activities primarily in colombia 
off balance sheet arrangements as at december   and we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations gran tierra holds three categories of operating leases  namely office  vehicle and housing 
we pay monthly costs of  for office leases   for vehicle leases and  for certain employee accommodation leases in colombia  argentina and peru 
future lease payments and other contractual obligations at december  are as follows as at december  payments due in period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years thousands of us dollars operating leases software and telecommunication drilling  completion  facility construction and oil transportation services total contractual commitments have increased million from december  as a result of increased operating leases million increased software and telecommunication contracts million and entering into more third party facility construction  oil transportation and drilling rig commitment contracts million  mainly in colombia 
related party transactions in connection with the solana acquisition  we acquired additional office space of  square feet used by solana as its headquarters in calgary 
the lease payments under the lease are  per month and operating and other expenses are approximately  per month 
the lease expires on april  on february   we entered into a sublease for that office space with a company  of which two of gran tierra s directors are shareholders and directors 
the term of the sublease runs from february  to august  and the sublease payment is  per month plus approximately  for operating and other expenses 
the terms of the sublease were consistent with market conditions in the calgary real estate market 
subsequent event on january   gran tierra issued  common shares upon the exercise of  warrants issued upon the acquisition of solana for million or per share 
outlook business environment our revenues have been negatively impacted by the continuing fluctuations in crude oil prices 
crude oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about financial markets and the impact of the downturn in the worldwide economy on oil demand growth 
however  based on projected production  prices  costs and our current liquidity position  we believe that our current operations and capital expenditure program can be maintained from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand  barring unforeseen events or a further severe downturn in oil and gas prices 
should our operating cash flow decline  we would examine measures such as reducing our capital expenditure program  issuance of debt  disposition of assets  or issuance of equity 
the credit markets  including the commercial paper markets in the united states  have experienced adverse conditions 
although we have not been materially impacted by these conditions  continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with renewing or issuing debt  or affect our  or third parties we seek to do business with  ability to access those markets 
our future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets 
determination of the borrowing base under a new credit facility if any  will most likely be dependent on our success in maintaining or increasing oil and gas reserves and on future oil prices 
additional funds will be provided to us if holders of our warrants to purchase common shares decide to exercise the warrants 
should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities  such funding may be affected by the market value of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock declines  our ability to utilize our stock to raise capital may be negatively affected 
also  raising funds by issuing stock or other equity securities would further dilute our existing stockholders  and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our stock price 
any securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities 
borrowing money may also involve pledging of some or all of our assets 
work program and capital expenditure program gran tierra s work program is intended to create both growth and value in our existing assets through increasing our reserves and production from exploration financed by cash flow  while retaining financial flexibility with a strong cash position and no debt  so that we can be positioned to undertake further development opportunities and to pursue acquisition opportunities 
however  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from our work program if unexpected events or circumstances occur  such as new opportunities present themselves  or anticipated opportunities do not come to fruition  which may therefore either increase or decrease the amount of capital expenditures we incur in excluding potential exploration success  production in is expected to range between  bopd net after royalty 
gran tierra has planned a capital spending program of million for exploration and development activities in colombia  peru  argentina and business development activities in brazil 
planned capital expenditures in colombia are million  million in peru  and million in argentina 
we expect that our committed and discretionary capital program can be funded from cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
outlook colombia the capital program in colombia is million 
the majority of the capital spending in colombia is associated with exploration  which includes the drilling of exploration wells plus seismic acquisition programs in blocks to prepare drilling opportunities for the exploration drilling program in colombia includes the following wells chaza block exploration well  guayuyaco block exploration well  azar block exploration wells  rumiyaco block exploration well  piedemonte sur exploration well  piedemonte norte exploration well 
the seismic acquisition in colombia include the following programs chaza block km d  guayayaco block km d  azar block km d  rumiyaco block km d km d  piedemonte norte block km d  piedemonte sur block km d 
in addition to the above exploration activity we plan to spend approximately million on development related activities which includes drilling one water injector well in the costayaco field and infrastructure improvements 
new infrastructure construction planned for the costayaco field includes crude gathering lines  water lines  pumping stations  storage batteries  crude unloading facilities  water injection and disposal  and costayaco electrification and field support facilities 
during upgrades to the santana pumping station are scheduled to continue  with the objective to improve storage and pumping capacity 
outlook argentina the capital program in argentina is million 
gran tierra s planned work program for consists of a re entry and sidetrack of one well in the valle morado block  seismic acquisition in the santa victoria block  facilities upgrades  and well workovers 
in the valle morado block  a re entry and sidetrack of the vm 
x well is scheduled for q  for an estimated cost of million 
the sidetrack well is being drilled to test the resource potential discovered by the vm 
x well 
existing pipeline and gas processing plant capacity is capable of handling mmscf day 
in the santa victoria block a km d and km d seismic acquisition program is planned for q to define structural and stratigraphic traps in a gas condensate trend identified from existing seismic data 
the budget also includes approximately million for workovers and facilities upgrades on other gran tierra properties in the noroeste basin 
outlook peru the capital program in peru is million 
we have entered the second exploration period of both blocks and on the eastern flank of the mara on basin of northern peru 
we have identified more than leads based on interpretation of a  linear kilometer airborne gravity and magnetic survey completed over the blocks in an environmental and social impact assessment has been completed in preparation for initiating a kilometer d seismic acquisition survey beginning in the second quarter of over the principal leads identified on the two blocks 
we are planning on drilling up to four exploration wells beginning late in the second quarter of and continuing into the second half of outlook brazil we established a business development office in brazil during august  we are currently undertaking the evaluation of a variety of exploration and development new venture opportunities 
an operating budget of million to continue this initiative in brazil has been approved for critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regards to estimates used 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for oil and gas accounting and reserves determination  establishment of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of acquisitions  impairment  asset retirement obligations  goodwill impairment  deferred income taxes  share based payment arrangements  and warrants have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are discussed below 
actual results could differ from these estimates  however  historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas accounting reserves determination we follow the full cost method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec  as described in note to our annual consolidated financial statements 
full cost accounting depends on the estimated reserves we believe are recoverable from our oil and gas reserves 
the process of estimating reserves is complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geo physical  engineering and economic data 
to estimate the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and related future net cash flows  we incorporate many factors and assumptions including expected reservoir characteristics based on geological  geophysical and engineering assessments future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities future oil and gas quality differentials assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies future development and operating costs we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates 
however  these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the united states as prescribed by the society of petroleum engineers 
reserve estimates are audited at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants 
our board of directors oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures 
the board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process  results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work  whether they have had access to sufficient information  the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion  and in the case of the independent reserves consultants  their independence 
reserves estimates are critical to many of our accounting estimates  including determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically producible reserves calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
proved reserves estimates are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit of production in calculating our depletion expense 
assessing  when necessary  our oil and gas assets for impairment 
estimated future cash flows are determined using proved reserves 
the critical estimates used to assess impairment  including the impact of changes in reserves estimates  are discussed below 
oil and gas accounting and impairment the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties  the costs of which are individually significant  are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter on a country by country basis 
the ceiling limits these pooled costs to the aggregate of the after tax  present value  discounted at  of future cash flows attributable to proved reserves  known as the standardized measure  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
cash flow estimates for our impairment assessments require assumptions about two primary elements constant prices and reserves 
it is difficult to determine and assess the impact of a decrease in our proved reserves on our impairment tests 
the relationship between the reserves estimate and the estimated discounted cash flows is complex because of the necessary assumptions that need to be made regarding period end production rates  twelve month unweighted average prices and costs 
if these capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  we will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
due to the complexity of the calculation  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact that a reserves estimate decrease would have on our assessment of impairment 
a reduction in oil and natural gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation and could result in a ceiling test write down 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and found no impairment write down was required based on our assumptions for our colombia cost center 
as a result of assessing our oil and gas property impairment for our argentina cost center  a ceiling test impairment loss of million was recorded as a result of an increase in estimated future operating costs to produce our remaining argentine proved reserves 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and and found no impairment write downs were required based on our assumptions 
estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our december  ceiling tests were based on realized crude oil prices of and per mcf in colombia and for oil production in argentina and per mcf for gas production in argentina 
the acquisition of solana  effective november   was accounted for using the purchase method  with gran tierra being the acquirer  whereby the solana assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities  which was done with the assistance of independent advisors  is subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the extent of proved and unproved reserves of the acquired company as well as the future production and development costs and the future oil and gas prices 
while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non oil and gas properties  the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future depreciation  depletion and accretion expense 
also  a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties  based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices  will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value 
asset retirement obligations we are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
estimating our future asset retirement obligations requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future 
in addition  the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate 
we record asset retirement obligations in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities 
in arriving at amounts recorded  we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and expected changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
the asset retirement obligations result in an increase to the carrying cost of our property  plant and equipment 
the obligations are accreted with the passage of time 
a change in any one of our assumptions could impact our asset retirement obligations  our property  plant and equipment and our net income 
it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions 
as a result  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of net assets acquired and we test for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the net book value of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value  including goodwill  we write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units  we estimate the fair values of the reporting units based upon estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the goodwill on our financial statements was a result of the solana and argosy acquisitions  and relates entirely to the colombia reporting segment 
this reporting segment is not at risk of failing the step goodwill impairment test under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and others 
the calculated fair value of the colombian business unit was significantly in excess of its book values 
differences in the our actual future cash flows  operating results  growth rates  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of calculating the fair value of each business unit  as well as a decline in our stock price and related market capitalization  could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and  accordingly  potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges 
income taxes we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences in reported amounts for financial statement and tax purposes 
we carry on business in several countries and as a result  we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
the determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments 
while income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments  we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations 
however  changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits  reassessments  jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in the our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item 
we consider the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
share based payment arrangements we record share based payment arrangements in accordance with the asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
under asc  share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated method 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
under asc  we utilized a black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards 
warrants we follow the fair value method of accounting for warrants issued to purchase our common stock 
the change of million in the fair value of warrants issued in the offering  arising from the amendment to the terms of the warrants in connection with the settlement of the liability for liquidated damages  was determined using a black scholes option pricing model using inputs similar to those used for gran tierra s issued equity instruments issued 
new accounting pronouncements framework for fair value measurement in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance related to the application of the framework for fair value measurement to non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the fasb decided to delay the effective date of applying the framework for fair value measurement to non financial assets and non financial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the implementation of this guidance  effective january   did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued accounting standards which require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establish the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
in april  the fasb issued guidance to address application issues raised by preparers  auditors and members of the legal profession on initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
these standards were applied prospectively 
the implementation of these standards  effective january   did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the fasb issued accounting standards that require enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the standards increase convergence with international financial reporting standards ifrs  as it relates to disclosures of derivative instruments 
the implementation of these standards  effective january   did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the sec modernization of oil and gas reporting in december  the sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require a company to a disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserve audit and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices 
gran tierra has adopted the provisions of this final ruling for disclosures in the financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ending december  the implementation of this rule did not materially impact gran tierra s disclosures  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
fair value measurement in inactive markets and distressed transactions in april  the fasb issued guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with the framework for fair value measurement  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
at the same time the fasb issued guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
the standard was applied prospectively 
the implementation of this standard  effective for interim periods ending after june   did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results and cash flows 
subsequent events in may  the fasb issued standards addressing subsequent events 
the standards address the recognition and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements 
the fasb issued the standards in order to incorporate  within the accounting standards  principles that had originated in auditing standards 
the standards also require an entity to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued 
the standards do not differ significantly from previously applied standards on disclosure of subsequent events 
gran tierra implemented these standards prospectively on june  the standards did not have a material impact on gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results and cash flows 
gran tierra has evaluated subsequent events through february   the date the financial statements were issued  and noted no subsequent events that required disclosure 
fasb accounting standards codification on july   the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative us gaap other than guidance issued by the sec  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force  and related literature 
the codification was applied on september  now  only one level of authoritative us gaap exists 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification does not change us gaap  instead  it introduced a new structure that is organized in an online research system 
the codification did not have an impact on gran tierra s consolidated financial statements 
measuring liabilities at fair value in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update  measuring liabilities at fair value  this update provides clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
in such circumstances  an entity is required to measure fair value that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique consistent with the fair value measurement principles such as an income approach or a market approach 
the implementation of this update october  did not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results and cash flows 
variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued revised accounting standards to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the standards replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or  the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the standards will be implemented prospectively on january  gran tierra is currently reviewing the impact  if any  on gran tierra s consolidated financial statements 
gran tierra has reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standard updates in order to determine their effects  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
based on that review  gran tierra believes that the implementation of these standards will not materially impact gran tierra s consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to oil prices 
essentially of our revenues are from oil sales at prices which are defined by contract relative to wti and adjusted for transportation and quality  for each month 
in argentina  a further discount factor which is related to a tax on oil exports establishes a common pricing mechanism for all oil produced in the country  regardless of its destination 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility with standard bank plc  which we entered into on february   and which expired february   we entered into a costless collar financial derivative contract for crude oil based on wti price  with a floor of and a ceiling of  for a three year period  for barrels per day from march to december  barrels per day from january to december  and barrels per day from january to february at december   this costless collar represented a liability of  compared to an asset of  at december  a hypothetical increase in wti price on december  would cause the value to increase by approximately  and a hypothetical decrease in wti price on december  would cause the value to decrease by approximately  this compares to a hypothetical increase in wti price on december  would cause the value to decrease by approximately  and a hypothetical decrease in wti price on december  would cause the value to increase by approximately  we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial as we hold only cash and cash equivalents 
interest rate exposures relate entirely to our investment portfolio  as we do not have short term or long term debt 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issuers at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments 
foreign currency risk is a factor for our company but is ameliorated to a large degree by the nature of expenditures and revenues in the countries where we operate 
we have not engaged in any formal hedging activity with regard to foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is us dollars and essentially of our revenues are related to the us price of west texas intermediate oil 
in colombia until december  we received of oil revenues in us dollars and in colombian pesos at current exchange rates 
the majority of our capital expenditures in colombia are in us dollars and the majority of local office costs are in local currency 
as a result  the allocation between us dollar and peso denominated revenues has been approximately balanced between us and peso expenditures  providing a natural currency hedge 
in the future we will receive of our revenue in colombia in us dollars 
in argentina  reference prices for oil are in us dollars and revenues are received in argentine pesos according to current exchange rates 
the majority of capital expenditures within argentina have been in us dollars with local office costs generally in pesos 
while we operate in south america exclusively  the majority of our spending since our inauguration has been for acquisitions 
the majority of these acquisition expenditures have been valued and paid in us dollars 
additionally  foreign exchange gains losses result from the fluctuation of the us dollar to the colombian peso due to our deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  which is mainly denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations 
as a result  a foreign exchange gain loss must be calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
a strengthening in the colombian peso against the us dollar results in foreign exchange losses  estimated at  for each one peso decrease in the exchange rate of the colombian peso to one us dollar
