item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets and product lines on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lincare holdings inc and its subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for services and each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
certain items provided by the company are reimbursed under rental arrangements that generally provide for fixed monthly payments established by fee schedules for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues subject to capped rental arrangements which limit the rental payment periods in some instances and which may result in a transfer of title to the patient at the end of the rental payment period 
once initial delivery of rental equipment is made to the patient  a monthly billing cycle is established based on the initial date of delivery 
the company recognizes rental arrangement revenues ratably over the monthly service period and defers revenue for the portion of the monthly bill that is unearned 
no separate payment is earned from the initial equipment delivery and setup process 
during the rental period  we are responsible for servicing the equipment and providing routine maintenance  if necessary 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  
table of contents the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded by the company at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  generally ranging from several days to several weeks  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payor does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense  sales adjustments and related allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to increase or decrease our allowances for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amounts received from customers and third party payors and the expected realizable amounts 
actual adjustments that result from such differences are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
business acquisition accounting we apply the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the 
table of contents consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  customer and contract relationships and technology  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment test using a two step method on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for the purposes of that assessment  we have determined that the company has a single reporting unit 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment 
if the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the company performs step two 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the company evaluates its fair value using two different approaches 
the first approach utilizes the closing market price of its common stock at the annual impairment testing date and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on that date 
the second approach utilizes a discounted cash flow projection which is based on assumptions that are consistent with the company s best estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include the future cash flows  growth rates  discount factors and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we completed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the company based its goodwill impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions 
during the annual testing in the third quarter of the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of carrying value 
no recent events or circumstances have occurred to indicate that impairment may exist 
long lived assets we review property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows that the asset s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property and equipment include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition and a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
the company considered the recent medicare reimbursement changes and the circumstances noted above which may lead to impairment of property and equipment  and concluded there was no impairment 

table of contents in addition to consideration of impairment upon the events or changes in circumstances described above  management regularly evaluates the remaining lives of its long lived assets 
if estimates are revised  the carrying value of affected assets is depreciated or amortized over the remaining lives 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
results of operations net revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our net revenues by product category year ended december  in thousands oxygen and other respiratory therapy home medical equipment and other total net revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  a decrease of  compared to net revenues for the company estimates that the decrease in net revenues in was comprised of approximately internal and acquisition growth offset by approximately negative impact from million of medicare price reductions and payment changes taking effect in see medicare reimbursement 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of above net revenues for the increase in net revenues in was comprised of approximately internal growth and acquisition growth  partially offset by million of medicare price reductions taking effect in the internal growth in net revenues is attributable to underlying growth in the market for our products and increased market share  resulting primarily from our reputation for high quality equipment and customer service 
growth in net revenues from acquisitions is attributable to the effects of acquisitions of local and regional companies and is estimated based on the contribution to net revenues for the four quarters following such acquisitions 
in and  we completed the acquisitions of two and three businesses  respectively  with operations in multiple states 
the contribution of oxygen and other respiratory therapy products to our net revenues was  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and our strategy is to focus on the provision of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home and to provide home medical equipment and other services where we believe such services will enhance our core respiratory business

we also experienced an increase in enteral nutrition and infusion therapy costs associated with higher customer volumes 
the increase in cost of goods and services in is attributable primarily to higher oxygen costs related to an increase in the number of oxygen customers on service and higher costs of cpap supplies and accessories due to growth in our sleep therapy product lines 

table of contents cost of goods and services includes the cost of equipment excluding depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively  drugs and supplies sold to patients and certain operating costs related to the company s respiratory drug product line

contributing to the containment of growth in operating expenses during were lower fuel and other vehicle related expenses  lower purchases of supply items and controls over salary and related expenses  partially offset by higher employee health benefits costs 
the increase in operating expenses in is attributable to higher payroll and related expenses from employee headcount increases  partially offset by gains in productivity  and significantly higher vehicle and related expenses caused primarily by higher fuel prices 
the company manages over  operating centers from which customers are provided equipment  supplies and services

while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  the general economic climate and business acquisition activities may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the collection of deductible balances and co payment amounts due directly from customers may be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions in the us the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents operating income as shown in the table below  operating income for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the prior year period 
operating income in was negatively impacted by million of medicare price reductions and payment changes taking effect in  partially offset by revenue growth from increases in customer volumes and our efforts to control operating costs 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  when compared to the prior year period

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate increased from to because of an increase in the amount of permanent differences combined with a decrease in income before income taxes in of million  partially offset by favorable discrete adjustments 
the increase in the effective tax rate of was not significant 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes at both the federal and numerous state and local jurisdictions 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes 
such amounts are classified in the consolidated statements of financial position as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the classification of the related assets and liabilities 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december  we had net deferred tax assets  related to state income tax net operating loss carryforwards  of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  we have provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our national operations 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
unrecognized tax benefits consist of the carrying value of the company s recorded uncertain tax positions as well as the potential tax benefits that could result from other tax positions that have not been recognized in the financial statements under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
acquisitions in  the company acquired certain operating assets of two companies with operations in multiple states 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets and million to goodwill 
in  the company acquired certain operating assets of three companies with operations in multiple states 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operating costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service and share repurchases 
at december   our working capital was million 
at december   our working capital was million 
a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  we measure our dso by dividing our net accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by the product of our latest quarterly net revenues times four  multiplied by days 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  net investment in property and equipment of million  payments of debt of million and million in payments to repurchase our common stock  offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common shares 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  dated december   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  
table of contents subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
the company is in compliance and expects to be in compliance with all covenants in the near and long term based on its ability to access its cash and cash equivalents and its expected operating cash flows 
as of december   there were million of standby letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
at december   the company held million of short term investments  including million of auction rate securities and million in a put option on those securities 
the auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments with contractual maturities between the years and with interest rates that reset every seven or days pursuant to a bidding process as determined by the underlying security indentures 
the investments are classified as trading securities and are carried at fair value  with any realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other income and expense 
the company received partial redemptions of these securities  at par  in the amount of million in january see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the auction rate securities and related put option 
the company will continue to monitor credit market conditions to assess the liquidity of its investments 
due to the company s ability to access its cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under its revolving credit facility  and its expected operating cash flows  the company believes that it has adequate liquidity available to meet its obligations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan whereby the company may repurchase from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  shares of the company s common stock in amounts determined pursuant to a formula the share repurchase formula that takes into account both the ratio of the company s net debt to cash flow and its available cash resources and borrowing availability 
on january  and october   our board of directors approved modifications to the share repurchase formula to increase the ratio of debt to cash flow to allow additional share repurchases 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased and retired  shares for million pursuant to the repurchase plan 
as of december   million of the company s common stock was eligible for repurchase in accordance with the amended formula 
on october   we completed the sale of million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series a the series a debentures and million principal amount including exercise of a million over allotment option of convertible senior debentures due series b the series b debentures and together with the series a debentures  the series debentures in a private placement 
the series debentures pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum 
the series debentures are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will be convertible under specified circumstances based upon a base conversion rate  which  under certain circumstances  will be increased pursuant to a formula that is subject to a maximum conversion rate 
upon conversion  holders of the series debentures will receive cash up to the principal amount  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
the initial base conversion rate for the debentures is shares of common stock per  principal amount of series debentures  equivalent to an initial base conversion price of approximately per share 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  holders of the series a debentures and series b debentures will receive an additional number of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the debentures  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
we will have the right to redeem the series a debentures and the series b debentures at any time after november  and november   respectively 
holders of the series debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their series debentures upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change transactions or on november     and in the case of the series a debentures and november     and in the case of the series b debentures 
in june  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures were convertible into 
table of contents shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
interest on the debentures was payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
on june   we redeemed all of the outstanding debentures at par pursuant to a notice of redemption 
our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for the next year 
accounts receivable the company maintains payor specific price tables in its billing system that reflect the fee schedule amounts statutorily in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which lincare operates  situations can occur where expected payment amounts are not established by fee schedules or contracted rates  and estimates are required to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that revenues and accounts receivable will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
sales adjustments to revenues and accounts receivable can result from price differences between allowed charges and amounts initially recognized as revenue due to incorrect price tables or subsequently negotiated payment rates 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or account review 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
the company s payor mix is highly concentrated among medicare  medicaid and other government third party payors and contracted private insurance or commercial payors 
government payment rates are determined according to published fee schedules established pursuant to statute  law or other regulatory processes and commercial payment rates are based on contractual line item pricing as reflected in the respective contracts 
fee schedule updates have historically occurred on a prospective basis and have been made available to the company in advance of the effective date of a change in reimbursement rates 
the company s proprietary billing system has features that allow the company to timely update payor price tables within the system as changes occur in order to accurately record revenues and accounts receivable at their expected realizable values 
additional systems and manual controls and processes are used by management to evaluate the accuracy of these recorded amounts 
based on the company s experience  it is unlikely that a change in estimate of unsettled amounts from third party payors would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
accounts receivable balance concentrations by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows percentage of accounts receivable outstanding december  december  medicare medicaid other government private insurance customer pay total 
table of contents aged accounts receivable balances by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows percentage of accounts aged in days december  over medicare medicaid other government private insurance customer pay all payors percentage of accounts aged in days december  over medicare medicaid other government private insurance customer pay all payors the company operates regional billing and collection offices rbcos that are responsible for the billing and collection of accounts receivable 
the rbcos are aligned geographically to support the accounts receivable activity of the operating centers within their assigned territories 
as of december  and  there were  and  full time employees in the rbcos 
accounts receivable collections are performed by designated collectors within each of the rbcos 
the collectors use various reporting tools available within the company s proprietary billing system to identify claims that have been denied or partially paid by the responsible party and claims that have not been processed by the third party payor in a timely manner 
collections of accounts receivable are typically pursued using direct phone contact to determine the reason for non payment and  if necessary  corrected claims are prepared for resubmission and further follow up with the responsible party 
in some cases  third party payors have developed electronic inquiry methods that the company can access to determine the status of individual claims 
the company has benefited from the increasing availability of electronic funds transfers from payors  which now account for approximately of all payments received 
the company believes that its collection procedures contribute to its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and bad debt expense being among the lowest in its industry  according to published industry data and public filings of some of its competitors 
the ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses  including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor specific concerns 
the ultimate write off of an accounts receivable occurs once collection procedures are determined to have been exhausted by the collector and after appropriate review of the specific account and approval by supervisory and or management employees within the rbcos 
management and rbco supervisory and management employees also review accounts receivable write off reports  correspondence from payors and individual account information to evaluate and correct processes that might have contributed to an unsuccessful collection effort 
the company does not use an aging threshold for account receivable write offs 
however  the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted  and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write off 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
future minimum obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from repayment obligations for borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and series debentures  as well as contractual lease payments for facility  vehicle  and equipment leases and deferred acquisition obligations 
the following table presents  in aggregate  scheduled payments under our contractual obligations in thousands fiscal years thereafter total unsecured deferred obligations capital lease commitments long term debt interest expense operating leases employment agreements taxes related interest and penalties total amounts include the series debentures due the series a debentures are redeemable by us on or after november   and may be put to us for repurchase on november     and the series a debentures are shown in the table as scheduled for repurchase in as a result of the put feature 
the series b debentures are redeemable by us on or after november   and may be put to us for repurchase on november     and the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of million of which we anticipate payment settlement of thousand during we are unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the payment settlement date or the settlement amount for the remaining balance of million in unrecognized tax benefits

the codification is effective for all reporting periods that end after september  the adoption of asc did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fasb asc  business combinations  asc  which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
the provisions of asc are effective as of the beginning of the calendar year 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements  which is included in the codification in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures overall implementation guidance and illustrations 
the updated guidance provided a one year deferral of the effective date of asc for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company adopted the provisions of asc for non financial assets and non financial liabilities effective january   and such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued updated guidance for the accounting for convertible debt included in the codification in asc  debt with conversion and other options  which specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
upon adoption  the debt component of such instrument would be recognized by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
the equity component of such instrument would be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability component 
asc requires accretion of the resultant debt discount equal to the proceeds allocated to the equity component over the expected life of the debt 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted asc effective january   applied on a retrospective basis 
for a full discussion of the impact to the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued updated guidance related to business combinations  which is included in the codification in asc  business combinations identifiable assets  liabilities and any noncontrolling interest asc 
asc amends and clarifies asc to address application issues regarding initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
in circumstances where the acquisition date fair value for a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period and it is concluded that it is probable that an asset or liability exists as of the acquisition date and the amount can be reasonably estimated  a contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on the estimated amount 
the provisions of asc were effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  and did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures overall transition and open effective date information asc 
asc provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the guidance indicates if the reporting entity concludes there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability then transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value 
in such a situation further analysis of the transactions or quoted prices is needed and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with asc asc emphasizes that in identifying transactions that are not orderly an entity cannot assume that the observable transaction price is not orderly when the volume and level of activity for 
table of contents the asset or liability have significantly declined 
rather an entity must perform an analysis to determine whether the observable price is representative of a transaction that is not orderly 
asc amends the disclosure provisions of asc to require entities to disclose in interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation technique s used to measure fair value 
this requirement was previously limited to annual periods under asc further  if an entity changes the valuation technique s or related assumptions in measuring fair value  the entity is required to qualitatively discuss the changes in valuation technique s and related assumptions in both interim and annual financial statements 
entities have alternatives for adopting asc including to not early adopt in which case adoption is required no later than periods ending after june  or to early adopt for periods ending after march  we adopted asc for the period ended june  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fasb asc  financial instruments overall transition and open effective date information asc  which increases the frequency of fair value disclosures from annual only to quarterly to provide financial statement users with more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on financial instruments 
asc requires public entities to disclose in their interim financial statements the fair value of all financial instruments within the scope of asc as well as the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of those financial instruments 
entities have alternatives for adopting the asc including to not early adopt in which case adoption is required no later than periods ending after june  or to early adopt for periods ending after march  we adopted asc for the period ended june  the adoption of asc did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fasb asc  subsequent events overall asc  which provides guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
asc defines subsequent events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
financial statements are considered issued when they are widely distributed to shareholders and other financial statement users for general use and reliance in a form and format that complies with generally accepted accounting principles 
financial statements are considered available to be issued when they are complete in a form and format that complies with gaap and all approvals necessary for issuance have been obtained 
entities that have a current expectation of widely distributing their financial statements  such as public companies  are required to assess subsequent events through the date of issuance 
all other entities are required to consider subsequent events until financial statements are available to be issued 
asc requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued 
asc is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  and should be applied prospectively 
we adopted the provisions of asc for the period ended june  the adoption of asc did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update  measuring liabilities at fair value  which provides guidance on measuring the fair value of liabilities under fasb asc  fair value measurements 
asu reaffirms that fair value measurement of a liability assumes the transfer of a liability to a market participant as of the measurement date  that is  the liability is presumed to continue and is not settled with the counterparty 
in addition  asu reemphasizes that a fair value measurement of a liability includes nonperformance risk and that such risk does not change after transfer of the liability 
in a manner consistent with this underlying premise ie  a transfer notion  the asu requires that an entity should first determine whether a quoted price of an identical liability traded in an active market exists ie  a level fair value measurement 
the asu clarifies that the quoted price for the identical liability  when traded as an asset in an active market  is also a level measurement for that liability when no adjustment to the quoted price is required 
in the absence of a level measurement  an entity must use one or more of the following valuation techniques to estimate fair value in a manner consistent with the principles in asc  which can be classified into two broad categories a valuation technique that uses a quoted price quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset 
quoted price of a similar liability or of a similar liability when traded as an asset 
another valuation technique eg  a market approach or an income approach  including one of the following a technique based on the amount an entity would pay to transfer the identical liability 
a technique based on the amount an entity would receive to enter into an identical liability 
the asu emphasizes that regardless of the technique s used  an entity should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the guidance in asu is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
entities may also elect to early adopt the asu if financial statements have not been issued 
in the period of adoption  an entity is required to disclose any change in valuation technique and related inputs and quantify the total effect  if practicable 
we adopted this asu effective october  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which provides amendments to fasb asc subtopic  fair value measurements overall  requiring new disclosures as follows transfers in and out of levels and a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
activity in level fair value measurements 
in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
the update provides amendments to asc subtopic that clarify existing disclosures as follows level of disaggregation 
a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level 
table of contents the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation we currently do not anticipate any material increases in the near term in either the cost of supplies or operating expenses due to inflation 
with reductions in reimbursement by government and private medical insurance programs and pressure to contain the costs of such programs  we bear the risk that reimbursement rates set by such programs will not keep pace with inflation 
segment information we utilize the management approach for determining reportable segments 
the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we maintain a decentralized approach to management of our local business operations 
decentralization of managerial decision making enables our operating centers to respond promptly and effectively to local market demands and opportunities 
we provide home health care equipment and services through  operating centers in states 
we view each operating center as a distinct part of a single operating segment  as each operating center generally provides the same products to customers 
as a result  all of our operating centers are aggregated into one reportable segment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the fair values of our borrowings under the five year credit facility and the series debentures are subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
we estimate potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account anticipated operating and financial transactions 
our borrowings under the five year credit facility are subject to changes in market rates or prices 
the borrowings bear interest at british bankers association libor rate bba libor and an applicable margin based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at december  the fair value of our series debentures are subject to changes in market rates or prices 
our series debentures bear interest at 
the outstanding principal balance of our series debentures was million at december  the estimated fair values of the series a and series b debentures at december  were  and  respectively 
considering the total outstanding balance of million  a change in interest rates would result in a net increase in the market value of our series debentures outstanding at december  of approximately million
