overview our company we are the largest producer of muriate of potash potassium chloride or potash in the united states and are dedicated to the production and marketing of potash and langbeinite sulfate of potash magnesia  another mineral containing potassium 
our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash and langbeinite  and we market our langbeinite under the name of trio 
potassium is one of the three primary nutrients essential to plant formation and growth 
since  we have supplied  on average  approximately percent of world potassium consumption for fertilizer applications and percent of us consumption annually 
we are one of two producers of langbeinite  a low chloride fertilizer that is well suited for chloride sensitive crops and has the added benefit of magnesium 
we also produce salt  magnesium chloride  and metal recovery salts from our potash mining processes  the sales of which are accounted for as by product credits to our cost of sales 
we own five active potash production facilities three in new mexico referenced collectively below as carlsbad or individually as west  east  and north and two in utah moab and wendover and we have a current estimated productive capacity to produce  tons of potash and  tons of langbeinite annually 
we own two development assets in new mexico the hb mine  which is an idled potash mine that we are in the process of reopening as a solution mine that will utilize solar evaporation techniques in the production of potash  and the north mine  which was operated as a traditional underground mine until the early s 
intrepid routinely posts important information on its website under the investor relations tab 
intrepid s website address is www

com 
our asset base was built through the acquisition first of the moab operations in  and then the wendover and carlsbad operations in we assembled these assets after observing that the moab mine sold potash into the same geographic regions as the carlsbad  new mexico and wendover  utah mines 
we recognized that acquiring assets in those areas could allow for consolidated marketing efforts and effect operating synergies 
from the inception of mining in january to 
table of contents december   we have made capital investments in these mines to improve their reliability and the efficiencies of the mining operations 
intrepid was incorporated in the state of delaware on november   for the purpose of continuing the business of mining in corporate form after intrepid s ipo 
on april   intrepid closed its ipo by selling  shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately billion after underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction costs 
prior to april   intrepid was a consolidated subsidiary of mining  its predecessor 
since april   mining s ongoing business has been conducted by intrepid and includes all operations that previously had been conducted by mining 
on april   pursuant to an exchange agreement exchange agreement  mining assigned all of its assets other than approximately million of its cash to intrepid in exchange for  shares of intrepid s common stock and approximately million of the net proceeds of the ipo 
in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  intrepid also distributed to mining approximately million on april   referred to as the formation distribution 
the ipo  the transactions under the exchange agreement  and the formation distribution are referred to collectively as the formation transactions 
presentation of information the activity presented in all periods on or after april   is for intrepid while all periods presented prior to april   relate to mining as the predecessor entity 
the results of operations data for the year ended december   the period from april   through december  the successor period  and the balance sheet data as of december  and  presented herein  were derived from the consolidated financial results of intrepid 
the results of operations data for the period from january   through april   and the year ended december  referred to as the predecessor periods  presented herein  were derived from the historical financial statements of mining 
the financial statements for the predecessor periods give effect to identified revenues  estimated expenses  discrete events  substantiation of assets and liabilities and other methods management considered to provide a reasonable reflection of the results for such periods 
the historical financial data of mining may not be indicative of intrepid s future performance nor will such data reflect what its results of operations would have been had it operated as an independent  publicly traded company during the historical periods presented 
pro forma consolidated results of operations data are presented and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis to provide meaningful information for comparison purposes 
analytical information for non comparative periods will be discussed and analyzed where meaningful information is deemed to exist and will be presented in the position of greatest prominence 
we will additionally provide comparative analytical discussion about comparative periods on a pro forma basis consistent with the form and content standards set forth in article b of regulation s x under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the pro forma adjustments relate to expense associated with stock compensation expense  adjustments to reduce interest expense resulting from the repayment of debt  income taxes provided at the statutory rate for the periods related to mining since it was a limited liability company plus the aggregate impact of pro forma adjustments  and for any adjustments associated with weighted average common shares used in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
because the same assets were utilized in mining and intrepid before and after intrepid s ipo and since there was no material activity in intrepid from its formation in november until the closing of the ipo on april   there are no adjustments necessary to the production or sales results of the periods related to mining in order to create a comparative presentation involving or because of this  discussion of comparative operating statistics is unaffected  and the actual historical results of the successor and predecessor periods are presented

global factors affecting our results fertilizer demand long term global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth  changes in dietary habits  planted acreage  agricultural commodity yields and prices  grain inventories  application rates  global economic conditions  weather patterns and farm sector income 
we expect these key variables to continue to have an impact on fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future 
sustained income growth and agricultural policies in the developing world also affect demand for fertilizer 
fertilizer demand is affected by other geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention and changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries 
we note that the recent us and world economic crisis has led to volatility in agricultural commodity prices  and this crisis could have a lingering impact on the decisions farmers make related to their fertilization programs 
potash supply economically recoverable potash deposits are relatively rare and are well established 
virtually all potash is extracted from approximately twenty commercial deposits located in twelve countries 
according to the international fertilizer industry association ifa and data published by potash mining companies  six countries accounted for approximately percent of the world s aggregate potash production during companies in canada and the former soviet union lead the global potash market due to the size and grade of their reserves  among other factors 
as reported publicly  many of the larger potash producers curtailed production in in an effort to more closely match global demand 
since much of the demand for potash from these producers comes from brazil  india  and china  the decrease in purchases by these countries led to reported production declines by some of the world s largest potash producers 
now that new pricing contracts are being entered into  starting with china late in the fourth quarter of  we believe that the canadian  russian  belarusian  and german potash producers that curtailed production will recommence producing at higher relative rates sometime in energy demand and cost energy prices and consumption affect the potash industry in several ways 
energy policies in the united states have supported the development of biofuels  which currently rely upon agricultural products as feedstock 
as demand and prices for these agricultural products increase or decrease  the use of fertilizer becomes more or less economically attractive 
in addition  energy prices affect the global levels of oil and gas drilling  and such drilling often consumes potash as a fluid additive as a means to reduce the risk of swelling clays in the formation 
we believe that the positive benefit of potassium chloride in drilling and fracturing fluids has been well established in the oil and gas industry 
according to drilling rig count data compiled by baker hughes  the average monthly number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in north america has increased approximately percent from its low point during the second quarter of to the middle of february  resulting in a potential increase in demand for drilling fluids 
changes in fuel prices directly impact the cost of transporting potash from producing to consuming regions 
changes in natural gas prices also impact the cost of processing potash 
the average cost per mmbtu of natural gas for the year ended december   was lower than the average rate for  contributing to a decrease in our energy costs 
we estimate that every per mmbtu change in the cost of natural gas changes our cost of potash by approximately per ton  in part dependent on 
table of contents our volume of production 
we entered into a contract during the fourth quarter of that provides for a fixed price on the majority of our daily natural gas needs in new mexico for eleven months 
our products and markets as mentioned previously  our two primary products are potash and langbeinite  which is marketed as trio and may be referred to as such throughout this document 
the majority of our revenues and gross margin are derived from the production and sales of potash 
the percentage of our sales of trio during increased relative to our total sales  as sales of trio were less impacted by the recessionary economic environment than potash sales 
the percentages of our net sales  which is defined below in the section entitled specific factors affecting our results sales  and gross margins from potash were approximately as follows for the indicated periods 
contribution from potash sales net sales gross margin for the year ended december  for the period from april  through december  for the period from january  through april  for the year ended december  our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets which are the agricultural market as a fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
our primary regional markets include agricultural areas and feed manufacturers west of the mississippi river  as well as oil and gas drilling areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin 
we also have domestic sales that go into the southeastern and eastern united states  but on a smaller scale 
our potash production has a geographic concentration in the western united states and is therefore affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
demand for potash began to decline in the fall of and persisted through much of  due primarily to the interaction of historically high potash prices and the economic backdrop of falling prices for agricultural commodities 
variability in other input costs for the farm producer  as well as uncertainty resulting from the current us and global financial market crisis and recession  were also contributing factors 
demand in the agricultural sector for potash was at its lowest level in the last years of recorded data and was driven by farmers who elected to apply granular potash at lower rates than historical application rates as well as fertilizer dealers unwillingness to take inventory risk and hold inventory on their balance sheets 
the demand for our standard potash also declined from historically normal levels due to a decrease in oil and gas drilling and the delay in completion of oil and gas wells that was caused primarily by lower oil and gas commodity prices 
demand for standard potash was also impacted by some drillers experimenting with alternatives to standard potash or attempting to forego the use of potash altogether in drilling and completing their wells in an effort to reduce costs 
the downturn negatively affected our sales volumes throughout however  sales of potash in the fourth quarter of increased relative to the previous four quarters 
this demand was primarily in the agricultural sector as farmers had applied lower rates of potash in the previous growing season than compared to the preceding year average 
the late increase in demand was also due to the facts that the crop yield removed significant amounts of nutrients from the soil and that favorable weather in certain months allowed farmers to resume more normal application activity 
additionally  in late december  global producers of potash began reducing the sales price of potash to levels not seen since early the increased sales activity has continued into the early part of in the 
table of contents agricultural market primarily  but also on a more limited basis in the industrial market  as the average monthly drilling rig count has increased since the low point in mid it is unknown at this time if such an increase in sales volumes can be sustained for all of  although initial forecasts from industry news outlets such as fertecon limited  a fertilizer industry consultant  are calling for increased demand throughout while fertilizer consumption of potash in the united states during the agricultural year declined by an estimated percent  the agricultural year application rates are not yet known 
there is a continuing risk that potash application rates could be below historical levels 
over the longer term  we believe that domestic apparent consumption will eventually return to historical averages as the replacement of potassium in the soils is critical to continued high yield agricultural production 
we believe the long term trends support a return to these historic norms based on data generated by fertecon showing that over the past years the domestic apparent consumption for potash has averaged approximately million tons with annual volatility of less than percent through historical periods of low agricultural commodity prices  depressed oil and gas drilling  negative farmer margins  and a variety of other negative factors 
some of the demand that returned late in the third quarter of was likely driven by decreased pricing of potash domestically and internationally 
after the large north american producers reported publicly that they were lowering prices  we also reduced our selling prices for potash in order to remain competitive 
these price reductions  combined with the early fall fertilizer season described previously  began to have a positive impact on the sales of our products by the end of the third quarter of other recent pricing developments include sales by belarusian potash company bpc to chinese buyers at per metric ton cfr and canpotex entering a contract in february for new shipments to india through june at a contract price of per metric ton cfr 
european and us markets for potash also have shown signs of an increase in demand once these sales were announced 
factors that may impact pricing for the latter portion of the first half of include the amount and price that china will continue buying for the remainder of  how price negotiations will continue with india given that several of their contracts were settled in the third quarter of at prices up to per metric ton more than china s recent contracts  how much current and latent demand will be satiated at current prices  and whether recent increases in crop prices and other crop nutrients can be sustained 
the recent uptick in demand allowed us to sell more potash than we produced in the fourth quarter of  leading to a reduction in our inventory levels going into in addition  we have announced a per ton price increase effective march  given the competitiveness of the north american potash market  we may not consistently realize all of this price increase 
industrial demand for our standard product will likely continue to correlate with oil and gas pricing  drilling  and well completion activity  which has shown some signs of recovery since the third quarter of through industry publications  we monitor the oil and gas drilling rig count in the united states as an indicator of activity 
in the event that demand for our standard potash product does not recover with industrial demand  we have the ability to convert some of the potash produced for the industrial market into product available for sale into the agricultural market by compacting our standard industrial potash into granular potash 

table of contents the feed component of our sales  as a percentage of our overall sales mix  increased in relative to prior years  as this market stayed steady during the percentages of our potash sales volumes for each of our markets were approximately as follows for the indicated periods agricultural industrial feed for the year ended december  for the period from april  through december  for the period from january  through april  for the year ended december  we began producing and marketing trio in late  and we are working to expand our production of this product to meet increasing demand  particularly for the granular sized product 
trio is marketed into two primary markets  the agricultural market as a fertilizer and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
we market trio internationally through an exclusive marketing agreement with pcs sales usa  inc for sales outside north america and via a non exclusive agreement for sales into mexico 
increasing the awareness of the benefits of trio is a focus of our marketing efforts 
sales of trio on an international basis tend to be larger bulk shipments and vary as to when such shipments take place  therefore  we see greater variability in our sales volumes from period to period when compared to our domestic sales 
the export portion of trio decreased in as we did not have any large bulk shipments of the product into china  as we had in recent years 
the percentages of our trio sales volumes shipped to destinations in the united states remained quite strong for our granular sized product during the composition of our trio sales volumes domestically and in the export market were as follows for the indicated periods united states export trio only for the year ended december  for the period from april  through december  for the period from january  through april  for the year ended december  specific factors affecting our results sales our gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and trio and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling price we realize 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
freight costs are incurred only on a portion of our sales 
many of our customers arrange and pay for their own freight directly 
when we arrange and pay for freight  our quotes and billings are based on expected freight costs to the points of delivery 
our gross sales include the freight that we bill  but we do not believe that gross sales provide a representative measurement of our performance in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying for their own freight  in the geographic distribution of our products  and in freight rates 
we view net sales  which are gross sales less freight costs  as the key performance indicator as it conveys the sales price of the product 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the price of potash was the principal factor affecting our net sales as we were essentially selling all of the product we could produce 
during late and into  the principal factors affecting our net sales were the volumes of our sales  coupled with a decreasing average net realized selling price 
the volumes of product we sell are determined by 
table of contents demand for our products and by our production capabilities 
we have been actively managing our production levels in response to market demand with a view toward managing inventory levels in the near term and ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong 
our profitability is directly linked to the sales price of our product and  to a lesser extent  to the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash that affect our variable costs 
beginning late in the third quarter and carrying over into the fourth quarter of  we saw signs of a modest recovery in demand  as sales volumes increased  relative to prior quarters 
our consignment and forward warehousing efforts and ability to provide just in time inventory to our customers allowed us to participate actively in such sales 
in the first half of  there was substantial product in distributors warehouses 
much of the distributors inventories were reduced during the spring fertilizer season and into the summer  and distributors were  in general  hesitant to replenish their inventory 
in the first three quarters of  we put in place consignment and forward warehousing agreements that positioned our tons where customers can access them quickly when they are ready to buy potash 
these consignment and forward warehousing agreements helped mitigate price risk for our wholesale customers and  at the same time  positioned our tons for sale at more forward sales locations and expanded our inventory capacity to help position us for a potential recovery in demand 
we consider international prices in the determination of our selling price  and we have benefited from the weakening us dollar in prior periods 
during  this trend has continued as the canadian dollar strengthened relative to the us dollar 
the potential impact of a weaker us dollar is that canadian suppliers may adjust their sales price in us dollars upward in order to retain their local currency equivalent sales price  potentially allowing for increases in the net realized prices we can obtain for our products 
mitigating the impact of a weaker us dollar is the fact that our sales and costs are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar against other currencies has less of an effect on us as opposed to our competitors 
domestic pricing of our products is influenced by  among other things  the interaction of global supply and demand  ocean  land and barge freight rates  and currency fluctuations 
any of these factors could have a positive or negative impact on the price of our products 
average net realized sales prices for the last eight quarters are shown below 
the average net realized sales prices are derived by subtracting freight costs from gross sales revenue and then dividing this result by sales tons 
the decrease in the average net realized sales price from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of has been described previously 
these factors resulted in a downward trend in the market price of potash during  and our average net realized sales price decreased as well  as reflected below 
average net realized sales price for the three months ended potash trio per ton march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  with the publicly announced price decreases from our north american competitors  we reduced our posted price for red granular potash fob carlsbad to per ton in january our average net realized sales prices typically are below our posted prices 
effective march   we have increased our spot prices for potash to per ton fob carlsbad 

table of contents cost associated with abnormal production the impact of our lower sales levels was a reduction in our production rate 
this resulted in our producing at abnormally low levels relative to historical norms 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal within authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  with respect to inventory costing 
in the quarters ended december   september   june   and march   we determined that approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  of production costs would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming we had been operating at normal production rates 
as a result  these costs were excluded from our inventory value and instead expensed in the respective quarters as period production costs 
the result is the expensing of these costs and the exclusion of these costs from our inventory value 
the result is a more normal cost of goods sold per ton 
the assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and is unique to each quarter 
we compared actual production relative to what we estimated could have been produced if we had not elected market related shutdowns and lower operating rates in order to determine the abnormal cost adjustment 
approximately million of the abnormal cost adjustment in the fourth quarter of resulted from production disruptions at our east mine attributable to severe weather conditions 
other we also periodically evaluate our inventory levels to determine if any carrying cost issues exist under authoritative gaap with respect to inventory cost measurement 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded a lower of cost or market inventory write down related to our standard grade trio product produced at our east mine 
this lower of cost or market inventory write down  which totaled million  was necessary because the carrying cost of our standard grade trio inventory exceeded our estimates of future selling prices less reasonably predictable selling costs 
this was primarily a reflection of the competitive market price for standard grade trio  as the price had been reduced by a competitor  and we were forced to match this price in order to stay competitive 
the carrying cost of our trio inventory  as a co product produced at our east mine  includes joint costs allocated between trio and potash 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold reflects the costs to produce our potash and langbeinite products  less credits generated from the sale of our by products 
many of our production costs are fixed  and consequently our costs of sales per ton move inversely with the number of tons we produce  within the context of normal production levels 
our principal production costs include direct labor and employee benefits  maintenance materials  contract labor and materials for operating or maintenance projects  natural gas  electricity  operating supplies  chemicals  depreciation and depletion  royalties  leasing costs  and plant overhead expenses 
there are elements of our cost structure associated with contract labor  consumable operating supplies  and chemicals that are variable  which make up approximately percent of our cost base 
in absolute dollars  production related spending decreased by million during the year ended december   compared to this overall decrease resulted primarily from decreased natural gas costs  contract labor costs  royalties incurred upon sales  electricity costs  labor expenses  packaging and other supplies expenses  and fuel costs 
these decreased expenditures were partially offset by increases in depreciation  property tax  insurance costs  and other professional services and a decrease in by product credits 
the cost of our labor  maintenance materials  operating supplies  and chemicals continue to increase with inflation in the mining sector 
according to mining cost service  published in october by infomine usa  inc  mill operating costs have increased by approximately percent from to september we expect our future production costs to continue to be influenced by inflation in the mining sector  as well as to be influenced by price trends for natural gas  electricity  and 
table of contents fuel 
our labor costs in carlsbad  new mexico may continue to be influenced by the demand for skilled labor in the potash  oil and gas  and the nuclear waste storage industries 
we have also been experiencing a decrease in the mill head feed grade ore grade at our west and east mines over the last three years 
the development plan for the west mine included increased mine development  which results in lower delivered ore grade 
the east mine contains a mixed ore body  and the ore grade of ko for the combination of muriate of potash and langbeinite has been percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
this decrease in ore grade increases our operating costs per ton of product produced 
our internal production models for ore grade in at the east mine are consistent with the ore grade we realized in the mix of ore from our east mine between muriate of potash and langbeinite also will impact the amount of product tons of potash and trio ultimately produced from the facility 
production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change such as for annual maintenance turnarounds  mine development  or voluntary shutdowns to manage inventory levels 
excluding the effects of the direct expensing of costs associated with abnormally low production rates  our cash cost per ton decreased in the fourth quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of our potash cash cost per ton  net of per ton of by product credits  was per ton in the quarter ended december   compared to per ton  net of per ton of by product credits  in the same quarter of on an annual basis  our potash cash cost per ton  net of per ton of by product credits  was per ton in the year ended december   compared to per ton  net of per ton of by product credits  in our normal production costs are first absorbed into inventory  and the inventory could take some time to turn over if market conditions that existed in carryover into our expensing of abnormal production costs directly in the period excludes such costs from the cost of sales results 
we produced a lower level primarily at our wendover and carlsbad west mines in with the recent uptick in demand  we have resumed a full production schedule at our west mine and are working to increase staffing to be able to run at full operating rates by mid due to the tight labor market in the carlsbad area  we may not be able to hire enough qualified employees quickly enough to achieve our goal of running at full operating rates by mid we pay royalties to federal  state and private lessors under our mineral leases  and such payments are typically a percentage of net sales of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable lease 
in some cases  federal royalties for potash are paid on a sliding scale basis that varies with the grade of ore extracted 
in the year ended december   the period from april   through december   the period from january   through april   and the year ended december   our royalty rate was percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
we expect that future average rates will be relatively consistent with these average historical rates 
selling and administrative expenses our selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related employee benefits costs  company airplane costs  legal  accounting and other professional fees  selling and public relations expenses  lease costs  and costs related to our information and technology systems 
because our facilities are difficult to reach by commercial aviation  we operate a company airplane to enhance our ability to manage our facilities 
income taxes intrepid is a subchapter c corporation and therefore is subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income  whereas its predecessor entity  mining  was a limited liability company  which was not directly liable for the payment of federal or state income taxes 
for the year ended december   and the period april   through december   intrepid s effective tax 
table of contents rate was percent and percent  respectively 
state income taxes have a material impact on our overall effective income tax rate 
the tax basis of the assets and liabilities transferred to intrepid pursuant to the exchange agreement was  in the aggregate  equal to mining s adjusted tax basis in the assets as of the date of the exchange  increased by the amount of taxable gain recognized by mining in connection with the formation transactions 
therefore  the tax basis in the assets and liabilities transferred to intrepid was significantly higher than the book basis in the same assets and liabilities 
the basis difference between book and tax generated a net deferred tax asset for intrepid immediately following the transaction 
the net deferred tax asset recorded as of the date of exchange was approximately million  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the majority of intrepid s deferred tax asset has been assigned to mineral properties  and the anticipated use of percentage depletion to reduce our taxable income  relative to book income  is expected to provide full realization of this asset over time 
for the year ended december   our total tax expense was million 
total tax expense in was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
for the period from april   through december   our total tax expense was million 
total tax expense for the period from april   through december   was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
our current tax expense for these periods is less than our total tax expense in large part due to the impacts of percentage depletion and bonus depreciation 
additionally  the general effect of tax basis in excess of book basis  both currently and in future periods  is that taxable income will be lower than book income to the extent of the basis difference 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
the majority of this deferred tax asset is due to intrepid s tax basis exceeding its book basis for property  plant  and equipment and mineral properties 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets to determine if the need for a valuation allowance exists  and we have concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary 
we base this conclusion on the expectation that future taxable income should allow us to fully realize these deferred tax assets 
currently  we anticipate that  for federal income tax purposes  percentage depletion allowed with respect to our mineral properties will exceed cost depletion in each taxable year 
intrepid is required to evaluate its deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to intrepid s current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in which intrepid is doing business 
changing business conditions for normal business transactions and operations  as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws  potentially alter intrepid s allocation and apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes 
these changes in allocations and apportionment will result in changes in the calculation of intrepid s current and deferred income tax calculations  including the valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effects of any such changes are recorded in the period of the adjustment 
such adjustments can increase or decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or deferred tax expense on the income statement 
a decrease of our blended state tax rate decreases the value of our deferred tax asset  resulting in additional deferred tax expense being recorded in the income statement 
conversely  an increase in our blended state income tax rate would increase the value of the deferred tax asset  resulting in an increase in our deferred tax benefit 
because of the magnitude of the temporary differences between book and tax basis in the assets of intrepid  relatively small changes in the blended state tax rate may have a pronounced impact on the value of the net deferred tax asset

included in the potash cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of is a reduction to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million that was recorded as a result of the decrease in the asset retirement obligation in excess of the net book value of the associated asset 
the impact of this was a per ton reduction in our depreciation  depletion  and amortization for this period 

table of contents we sold  and  tons of potash and trio  respectively  in the year ended december   as compared to  and  tons  respectively  in the same period of beginning in the fourth quarter of  a reduction in the demand for potash and trio led to a continuing lower total volume of sales in than in and resulted in the building of inventories compared to historical averages 
our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons less than in  and our production volume of langbeinite in was  tons  or  tons less than in this decreased production was due to actions we took to slow production of potash throughout the year in order to more closely align our supply with reduced market demand experienced in as part of these efforts  we shut down the west and east mines for two weeks in the first quarter of  and we continued to operate with three operating shifts instead of four shifts at our west mine on a reduced staffing level 
wendover also operated at lower than normal rates throughout most of the first three quarters of our east mine  however  returned to normal production levels in the third quarter to meet demand for our granular trio product 
in addition  as we have previously publicly disclosed  there was a production disruption in december due to severe cold weather conditions at our carlsbad east facility that reduced our normal potash production levels during the month by nearly percent 
this event is not expected to have a long term impact to our production capabilities at the east facility 
our average net realized sales price of potash was per ton in the year ended december   as compared to per ton for the combined periods of the increase in our average net realized sales price was achieved as a result of tight supply and demand conditions and strong agricultural prices through and our ability to hold some of this price increase for a period of time in the average net realized sales price increase presented is not indicative of the market conditions that existed as we progressed through rather  the market conditions were one of overall decreased demand and continually falling prices throughout the year 
excluding costs associated with abnormal production  our potash gross margin as a percentage of net sales was percent for the year ended december   as compared to percent in the period from april   through december   and percent in the period from january   through april  including the abnormal production costs  our potash gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in from the periods described previously 
the change in gross margin has occurred primarily as a result of higher per ton production costs due to lower production during relative to production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons less than in this decreased production was largely driven by reduced ore grades at both of our carlsbad  new mexico mines  partially offset by improved recoveries at the east mine 
we also shut down for scheduled maintenance at some of our facilities in the fourth quarter of production volume of langbeinite in was  tons  or  tons greater than in  principally due to an increased langbeinite ore grade and increased ore throughput at our east mine 
freight costs increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to increases in export shipments to china and increases in fuel costs 
outlook for with the recent publicly announced settlement of negotiations between chinese buyers and bpc belarusian potash company at per metric ton cfr in december as well as the recent deal between india and canpotex in february at per metric ton cfr  it appears that the global decline in potash prices may have ceased  adding clarity to the pricing volatility that began early in the latest settlements have brought potash prices back in line with other crop fertilizer prices  thus potentially setting the stage for a recovery in global demand 
much of the dealer inventory that had accumulated by early was cleared by the end of the year  such that producers are primarily the only part of the north american fertilizer supply chain with above average inventories 
to the 
table of contents extent fertilizer demand continues to develop in  we may see normal spring demand elevated due to increased purchasing by farmers after their deferral of purchases from late through much of we expect that the application rates for potash fertilizers will be higher in  relative to we believe fertilizer dealers may continue to be cautious due to the recent market environment of by limiting the amount of inventory they keep on hand 
we may benefit from this trend as we believe we are well positioned to provide just in time product in certain key agricultural markets 
we believe our strong balance sheet will enable us to continue developing our growth projects and execute our marketing strategies 
capital investment we operate in a capital intensive industry that requires consistent capital expenditures to replace assets necessary to sustain safe and reliable production 
at each of our facilities  we have developed an investment plan to maintain safe and reliable production  ensure environmental compliance  improve and modernize equipment  increase production  and decrease per ton production costs 
we have identified key projects at each of our facilities that we believe will allow us to increase our potash and langbeinite production capacity and efficiency of operations over time 
this operational focus on continuing to enhance the reliability of our production is particularly directed at our carlsbad facilities and is designed to lower our operating cost per ton with production efficiency and debottlenecking projects 
in  we invested approximately million in capital projects 
as we continue to invest in our facilities  we proactively manage our projects in order to manage cash investment with the need to maintain an appropriate cash level on our balance sheet that will allow us to react strategically to market conditions 
based on our expected pace of capital expenditures in and our active management of our balance sheet in the environment of decreased demand for our products  we believe we can maintain a sufficient amount of cash on our balance sheet to work through periods of lower relative sales 
we continue to prepare for construction of the hb solar solution mine  a project to develop and build a solar evaporation solution mine 
project costs are being revised to include the additional timeline associated with permit delays  and the current total estimated project cost is between and million 
this project cost range has increased from previous estimates due to the costs associated with the environmental impact statement eis and the attendant delays in the project 
we expect to invest the bulk of this capital when we receive the necessary approvals and permits from the state and federal regulatory agencies 
in january  the bureau of land management blm informed intrepid that it has determined that an eis is required to evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed hb solar solution mine 
as a consequence  final permitting and approval of the hb solar solution mine will be delayed and capital expenditures for it deferred while the eis is completed 
we currently anticipate that the eis process will be completed in the third or fourth quarter of once the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  construction will begin and first production should result approximately twelve to eighteen months later  with full production anticipated approximately two years after approvals are obtained and construction begins 
we have budgeted million to million for this project in that will be used for continued permit activities  engineering  and some advance purchases of materials 
total capital investment in is budgeted to be between to million 
a breakdown of our capital investment plan includes approximately to million to replace assets needed to maintain production  to million to improve and modernize equipment  to million to increase productive capacity as described more fully below  and million  a portion of which has been reimbursed and another portion which we expect to be reimbursed by our insurer  to continue the replacement of the east mine warehouse 
the capital program will be funded out of cash flow and existing cash on hand 
we believe that  in the long term  demand for potash and trio will at least return to historical levels  therefore  we are making capital investments at our facilities that are 
table of contents designed to increase our production capabilities of potash and langbeinite and lower our per ton operating cost 
as noted previously  the pace of this capital investment will be highly dependent on the cash flows generated from operations from the sale of our products  and the levels of investment may vary significantly from the range presented above 
the following are a few of the projects that are slated for investment in to improve the overall reliability of the operations and increase productive capacity complete the full commissioning of the underground horizontal stacker  storage  and hoisting system and complete the work to improve potash recoveries at the west mine 
construction is substantially complete with operations having started on a phased basis in december complete commissioning is scheduled in the first quarter of  advance the engineering associated with an enhanced langbeinite recovery project at the east mine 
we continue to make progress on the system design and anticipate this project may include up to three stages  including coarse recovery  fine recovery  and granulation technology 
this project is a high priority due to the potential increase in langbeinite production from the same amount of current ore from the east mine  which would result in a lower average cost structure at the east mine 
we have accelerated the engineering investment in this project appropriately to ensure we are able to move into construction as expeditiously as is prudent 
the total estimated costs will be determined following a detailed market study and engineering design review at which time it will be presented to intrepid s board of directors for approval 
this project can be executed in several different ways  with a wide range of capital investment requirements 
as such  we are studying the alternatives and intend to make a decision that is reflective of the current market and that achieves many of the outcomes we believe are available to us from this project 
our capital investment estimates include approximately million of investment in associated with this recovery enhancement project  expand compaction capacity at the moab facility allowing intrepid to better adapt to market fluctuations associated with standard and coarse potash demands in order to better serve the agricultural market 
the project cost is expected to range between and million  replace wind damaged warehouse capacity at the carlsbad east facility for approximately million 
insurance payments supported the replacement of some warehouse capacity in in addition  new warehouse capacity for million is planned at wendover to provide increased operational flexibility  and add new equipment  including miners and conveyors  to develop new mine panels at the carlsbad mines at costs of approximately to million 
all dollar amounts for future capital spending are estimates that are subject to change as projects are further developed  modified  deferred  or canceled 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  we had no debt  and we had availability of million under our senior credit facility 
included in cash and cash equivalents were million in cash and million in cash equivalent investments  consisting of money market accounts or certificates of deposit with banking institutions for million  us treasuries with daily liquidity of approximately million  and us bank national association us bank commercial paper of approximately million 
we had no losses on our cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   and all cash equivalents are invested with institutions that we believe to be financially sound 
additionally  as of december   we had million and million invested in short term and long term certificate of deposit investments  respectively 

table of contents our operations are primarily funded from cash on hand and cash generated by operations  and  if necessary  we have the ability to borrow under our senior credit facility 
for the foreseeable future  we believe that our cash and investment balances  cash flow from operations  and available borrowings under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  our working capital requirements  and our presently planned capital investments 
intrepid potash  inc intrepid mining llc predecessor april  through december  year ended december  january  through april  year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities there are no directly comparable periods for an analysis of operating activities on a year to year basis due to the date of our ipo in april the discussion  therefore  will focus on significant trends in each historical period presented 
total cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the period from april   through december   and million for the period from january   through april  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to the combined prior year periods for is due primarily to a decrease in net income because of lower sales and production volumes 
the change in trade accounts receivable in relative to the same period in further contributed to the decrease in cash  as trade accounts receivable increased million relative to a decrease of million in the combined periods of  due primarily to increased sales in the fourth quarter of when compared to a slowing of sales into the fourth quarter of these changes were partially offset by a lower increase in inventory relative to the same period of for the year ended december   inventories increased million relative to an increase of million in the combined prior year periods for  reflecting the same set of events that impacted the change in trade accounts receivable  as more sales in the fourth quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of decreased inventory levels that had also been managed more closely throughout total cash provided by operating activities in the combined prior year periods of was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the combined periods of was driven by the upward trend throughout in the average net realized sales prices for potash and trio  partially offset by increased inventories resulting from lower demand in the fourth quarter of relative to as another positive impact to cash flows from operations  trade accounts receivable decreased in the combined period for relative to an increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory balances of million in compared to a decrease of million in  because of increased finished goods inventory resulting from slower sales in the fourth quarter of and increased values of work in process inventory at our wendover facility 
because we made estimated income tax payments in excess of our estimated income tax liability  the refundable income tax asset balance also increased to million as of december  
table of contents investing activities total cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the combined periods for the year ended december  the million in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was comprised of million for the period from april   through december   and million for the period from january   through april  cash invested in property  plant and equipment as well as mineral properties and development costs increased to million in the year ended december   from million in the same period of  reflecting our continued efforts to upgrade and enhance the efficiency of our facilities 
for the year ended december   we purchased a net million of certificate of deposit investments in an effort to earn a higher return and liquidated million in investments related to the bond sinking fund 
for the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  of insurance settlements related to property damage  which we used toward the construction of warehousing facilities at the east mine 
total cash used in investing activities was million for the combined periods in compared to million for the cash invested in property  plant and equipment comprised the majority of cash outflows in both years 
in addition to the million of insurance settlements related to property damage at our warehouse at the east mine that we received in  we also received million in related to the same claim 
as mentioned  all settlement money was used toward the construction of warehouses at the east mine 
financing activities total cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in cash provided by financing activities for the combined periods for the year ended december  the million in cash provided by financing activities for the combined periods in was comprised of million received during the period from april   through september   and million used during the period from january   through april  for the year ended december   million was paid by intrepid for employees tax withholdings upon the vesting of certain restricted common stock awards for employees who elected to net share settle their awards 
for the period from january   through april   the predecessor period  net proceeds from long term debt totaled million  and distributions to members of mining totaled million 
this distribution had no net impact to intrepid following the ipo  since mining retained all of its cash balances at the time of the initial public offering 
the distribution was paid out of cash on hand  no amounts were drawn against the senior credit facility to make this distribution 
net proceeds related to the ipo of billion were received in the period from april   through december  of the total cash received related to the ipo  million was distributed to mining  in connection with the formation transactions described previously  and debt of million was repaid 
total cash provided by financing activities was million for the combined periods in compared to million in cash used in financing activities in in june  potash acquisition  llc  an unrelated party to mining  acquired a percent membership interest in mining for million  net of transaction costs 
funds received were used to decrease the outstanding balance of the revolving portion of mining s existing senior credit facility

obligations under the senior credit facility are cross collateralized between intrepid and certain of its subsidiaries 
intrepid s million revolving credit facility has a term through march   and the entire amount of the revolving credit facility is available for use as of december  outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  which  at our option  is either i the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between percent and percent  depending upon our leverage ratio  which is equal to the ratio of our total funded debt to our adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ii an alternative base rate 
we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the outstanding portion of the unused revolving credit facility amount of between percent and percent  depending on our leverage ratio 
the senior credit facility contains certain covenants including  without limitation  restrictions on i indebtedness  ii the incurrence of liens  iii investments and acquisitions  iv mergers and the sale of assets  v guarantees  vi distributions  and vii transactions with affiliates 
the senior credit facility also contains a requirement to maintain at least million of working capital  a ratio of adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges greater than to  and a ratio of the outstanding principal balance of debt to adjusted earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization of not more than to the senior credit facility also contains events of default including  without limitation  failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner  the breach of certain covenants or representations and warranties  the occurrence of a change in control  and judgments or orders of the payment of money in excess of million on claims not covered by insurance 
intrepid was in compliance with all covenants with respect to the senior credit facility on december  our senior credit facility required us to maintain interest rate derivative agreements to fix the interest rate for at least percent of the projected outstanding balance of our term loan  when we had debt outstanding 
historically  we maintained derivative hedging agreements that were swaps of variable rate interest for fixed rate payments 
despite repaying the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility at the time of the ipo  we left the interest rate swap agreements in place taking the view that interest rates would rise and that the cost of settling the derivatives would be relatively beneficial as compared to closing out the contracts 
interest rates  however  have decreased  and the liability that we have under these derivative agreements has increased since the date of the ipo 
we review our derivative positions from the perspective of counterparty risk when we are in an asset position and believe that we continue to transact with strong  creditworthy institutions 
notional amounts for which the rate has been fixed as of december   are displayed below termination date notional amount weighted average fixed rate in thousands march  december  december  december  the weighted average notional amount outstanding for these derivatives as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives are million and percent 
the interest rate paid under our senior credit facility on any debt varies both with the change in the month libor rate and with our leverage ratio 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had contractual obligations totaling million on an undiscounted basis  as indicated below 
contractual commitments shown are for the full calendar year indicated unless otherwise indicated 
payments due by period total more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase commitments natural gas purchase commitments pension obligations asset retirement obligation minimum royalty payments total includes all operating lease payments  inclusive of sales tax  for leases for office space  an airplane  railcars and other equipment

we have committed to purchase a minimum quantity of natural gas  percent of which is priced at contractually fixed rates and percent of which is priced at floating index dependent rates  the latter being estimated based on forward rates as of february  amounts are inclusive of estimated transportation costs and sales tax 
minimum required pension contributions as estimated by our actuaries 
estimated contributions represent additional funds intrepid expects to pay into the pension plan and excludes amounts intrepid has placed in trust as plan assets to fund the pension obligation  as well as the future direct payments by the pension plan to participants 
we are obligated to reclaim and remediate lands which our operations have disturbed  but  because of the long term nature of our reserves and facilities  we estimate that none of those expenditures will be required until after commitments shown are in today s dollars and are undiscounted 
estimated annual minimum royalties due under mineral leases  assuming approximately a year life  consistent with estimated useful lives of plant assets 
payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated due to variable market conditions and are not included in the above tables

net sales and freight costs the following table presents potash and trio sales and production for the subject periods 
intrepid mining llc predecessor intrepid potash  inc pro forma for the year ended december  year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  change between periods change production volume in thousands of tons potash langbeinite sales volume in thousands of tons potash trio gross sales in millions potash trio freight costs in millions potash trio net sales in millions potash trio average net realized sales price potash trio net sales of potash decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this decrease was the net result of an increase in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or percent  and a decrease in volume of percent 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  there was a reduction in the demand for potash and trio that led to a lower total volume of sales in compared to and also resulted in the building of inventories relative to historical averages 
our production volume of potash in the year ended december   was  tons  or  tons less than in  principally due to our decision to decrease production in response to lower demand 
as part of these efforts  we shut down the west and east mines for two weeks in the first quarter of  and we continued to operate through the balance of with three operating shifts instead of four shifts at our west mine 
wendover also was operated at lower than normal rates throughout most of in order to adjust to market demand 
our east mine returned to normal production levels in the third quarter of only to suffer from weather related production 
table of contents disruptions in the fourth quarter of that  in turn  led to lower than normal operating rates in the fourth quarter 
net sales of trio increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent increase in the average net realized sales price  partially offset by a percent decrease in the volume of sales 
the first quarter of had a single sale of approximately  tons to an international customer  whereas this same customer  we believe  deferred purchasing any large quantity of trio in  having also been affected by underlying market demand 
production of langbeinite decreased percent in compared to  due primarily to the previously mentioned efforts to reduce production in response to lower demand  however  improvements in the rate of recovery of langbeinite from the mixed ore zone mined at our east mine and a somewhat lower grade of potash mined in this mixed ore zone proportionately increased the production of langbeinite relative to potash production in freight costs decreased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to lower sales volumes and secondarily to proportionally fewer international sales of trio  however  freight expense increased approximately million as a result of the increased movement of inventory to distribution warehouses pending sale 
as usual  the mix of customers paying for their own freight  the geographic mix of sales  and changing fuel costs affect the freight costs incurred by intrepid and gross sales 
we believe that our net realized price is a more meaningful number to evaluate and compare product revenues 
costs associated with abnormal production approximately million was excluded from the calculation of inventory and instead expensed in for potash production costs that would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming intrepid had been operating at normal production rates in included in the million was approximately million related to depreciation expense 
additionally  approximately million was excluded from the calculation of inventory and instead expensed in for trio production costs that would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming intrepid had been operating at normal production rates in included in the million was approximately million related to depreciation expense 
there were no similar abnormal cost adjustments in cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods 
intrepid mining llc predecessor intrepid potash  inc pro forma for the year ended december  year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  change between periods change cost of sales in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold per ton potash costs include and of depreciation expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
per ton trio costs include and of depreciation expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents the aforementioned abnormal production expenses are excluded from inventory costs and therefore are also excluded from cost of goods sold 
the total cost of goods sold per ton of potash increased per ton  or percent  from per ton on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  while production expenditures declined by million in relative to  the decrease in production levels  even after the abnormal production adjustment described above  led to the relative increase in the cost per ton 
the total cost of goods sold of our trio increased per ton  or percent  from per ton on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  the overall percent increase in trio costs of goods sold was comprised of an increase in cost  principally resulting from a greater allocation of joint costs to trio  based on its proportionally greater level of production relative to potash produced at our east mine  and an increase driven by lower overall production relative to that in aggregate dollars associated with cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  from million on a pro forma basis in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the decrease in the total expense was driven by the lower volumes sold 
production costs in  relative to  decreased by approximately percent in total 
there were decreases in spending on natural gas  contract labor  royalties  electricity  labor  fuel  and supplies  partially offset by increased costs of depreciation  property taxes  and insurance  as well as a reduction in by product credits 
labor and contractor costs decreased million  or percent  in due to reduced labor following the voluntary shutdowns in the first quarter of and continued reductions in operating rates to manage inventory levels 
natural gas expense decreased million  or percent  in the year ended december  lower rates drove million of the decrease and lower volumes drove million of the decrease 
additionally  realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives caused a million decrease in the expense 
electricity costs decreased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due to a decrease in volume of million and a decrease in rates of million 
royalty expense decreased million  or percent  from the year ended december   which corresponds to the reduction in net sales on which royalties are based 
property tax expense increased million  or percent  from the year ended december   due to increased property valuations based on revenue generated in prior periods 
insurance expense increased million  or percent  in due to higher insurance premiums 
other changes in cost of goods sold followed from decreased fuel costs  decreased usage of operating and packaging supplies  and increased depreciation expense based on increased capital investment 
by product sales credits reduced cost of goods sold by million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million resulting from a decline in the average selling price of the by products 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million in as compared to the pro forma expenses for the same period in the change represents an percent decrease from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  increases in expense related to an entire year s worth of costs for administrative and management staff associated with becoming a publicly traded company were more than offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense in  relative to a higher pro forma compensation expense in for awards issued in connection with the ipo that vested seven months after grant  and secondarily by lower bonus expense related to performance 

table of contents other income expense pro forma other income expense was a net income of million for the year ended december   and a net expense of million for the year ended december  the change was due primarily to insurance settlements of million in excess of property losses during the year ended december   and the effect of gains and losses on interest rate swaps and bond sinking fund investments 
a pro forma adjustment assuming an earlier ipo date and earlier debt repayment largely eliminated the impacts of the repayment of debt and increase in invested cash in the second quarter of for the year ended december   insurance settlements in excess of property losses of million were received in connection with the east mine wind shear claim 
through december   intrepid has received million from the insurer for the related claim  million of this amount was received in and is reported as a liability at december   pending the insurer s agreement to the related claims 
additional insurance payments to reconstruct the warehousing facilities are still contingent upon review by the insurer and therefore will be recognized in other income as settlements are agreed upon 
income taxes income taxes of million were recognized for the year ended december   at our effective tax rate of percent 
because mining was a limited liability company  it did not have an income tax expense  so there is no comparable figure for however  our pro forma estimate of income tax expense for the comparable period is million for the year ended december   assuming the statutory tax rate of percent as the effective tax rate 
the decrease in income tax expense was driven by the overall decrease in income levels between the respective periods

table of contents net sales and freight costs the following table presents potash and trio sales and production for the subject periods 
intrepid mining llc predecessor intrepid potash  inc pro forma for the year ended december  pro forma for the year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  change between periods change production volume in thousands of tons potash langbeinite sales volume in thousands of tons potash trio gross sales in millions potash trio freight costs in millions potash trio net sales in millions potash trio average net realized sales price potash trio net sales of potash increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due primarily to an increase in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or percent  resulting from strong potash demand 
during the fourth quarter of  a reduction in the demand for potash and trio resulted in a lower total volume of sales in than in and resulted in the building of inventories compared to historical averages 
our production volume of potash in the year ended december   was  tons  or  tons less than in this decreased production was largely driven by reduced ore grades at both of our carlsbad  new mexico mines  elective longer shutdowns to perform electrical upgrades  and partially offset by improved recoveries at the east facility  and improved ore grades at our utah facilities 
net sales of trio increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent increase in the volume of sales and a percent increase in the average net realized sales price 
production of langbeinite increased percent in the year ended december   compared to the same period in due primarily to higher langbeinite ore grades 
the higher concentration of langbeinite in the ore is coupled with a lower concentration of potash  so the offset to improved langbeinite production was lower potash production at the east mine 
freight costs increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to increases in export shipments to china and increases in fuel costs 
as usual  the mix of customers paying for their own freight affects the freight costs incurred by intrepid and gross sales 
as stated earlier  we believe that our net realized price is a more meaningful number to evaluate product revenues 

table of contents cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods 
intrepid mining llc predecessor intrepid potash  inc pro forma for the year ended december  pro forma for the year ended december  april  through december  january  through april  change between periods change cost of sales in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold per ton potash costs include of depreciation expense in the years ended december   and per ton trio costs include and of depreciation expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the pro forma cost of goods sold per ton of potash increased  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  potash costs per ton increased in the year ended december   due to significant cost increases representing percent of the increase and a decline in the production levels for the remaining percent of the increase 
the increased cost of goods sold in was partially offset by approximately a million adjustment reducing cost of goods sold and increasing the inventory valuation of our pond inventory at wendover and moab 
increased costs of trio were offset by increased production volumes such that the cost per ton remained relatively unchanged for the year ended december   compared to pro forma cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  costs that increased materially during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   included labor and contractor  benefits  maintenance material  natural gas  electricity  royalty  depreciation  and other expenses 
labor and contractor costs increased million  or percent  in the year due to contract maintenance projects  the addition of personnel to increase our maintenance staff and implement a trainee program  increased bonus accruals  and wage increases 
maintenance material costs increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   principally due to the increased level of maintenance projects 
royalty expense increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due to increased total sales revenue and higher trio sales  which incur a slightly higher average royalty than potash sales 
benefit expenses increased million  or percent  in principally due to the increased levels of employment 
other increases in cost of goods sold followed from increased insurance  operating supply  property tax  fuels  consulting  and employee recruitment expenses 
natural gas expense increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due principally to higher market rates 
higher rates drove million of the increase 
additionally  realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives caused a million decrease in the expense 
electricity costs increased million or percent in the year ended december   due principally to higher rates and fuel surcharges 
by product sales credits reduced cost of goods sold by million and million in the year ended december   and the year ended december   respectively 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million on a pro forma basis in as compared to the pro forma expenses for the same period in this represents a percent increase  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  pro forma selling and administrative expenses increased in due primarily to larger accruals for annual bonuses based on overall annual company performance  increased administrative and management staff associated with becoming a publicly traded company  and other expenses such as legal  consulting  audit  and tax services 
other for the year ended december   we incurred million in costs related to asset disposals  million of which related to the abandonment of an injection well in moab 
other income expense pro forma other income expense was a net of million of income for the year ended december   and a net of million of income for the year ended december  the change was due primarily to insurance settlements of million in excess of property losses during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  pro forma interest expense increased by million in the year ended december   from an expense of million in the year ended december   due principally to the timing of gains and losses on interest rate swaps 
a pro forma adjustment assuming an earlier ipo date and earlier debt repayment largely eliminated the impact in the above comparison of the repayment of debt in the second and third quarter of interest income increased by million during the year ended december   due to higher interest bearing cash balances 
other expenses in the year ended december   increased by million resulting from a loss on the bond sinking fund investments  held as restricted security for the moab reclamation liability 
income taxes income taxes of million were recognized in the april   through december   period at our effective tax rate of percent 
because mining was a limited liability company  it did not have an income tax expense  so there is no comparable figure for however  our pro forma estimates of income tax expense for the comparable periods are million in and million in the increase is driven by the overall increase in income levels in the respective periods

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers  which is generally when title passes  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales  but  in a few cases  title passes at the delivery destination 
the shipping point may be the plant  a distribution warehouse  a customer warehouse  or 
table of contents a port 
title passes for some international shipments upon payment by the purchaser  however  revenue is recognized for these transactions upon shipment because the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement 
prices are generally set at the time of  or prior to  shipment 
in cases where the final price is determined upon resale of the product by the customer  revenue is deferred until the final sales price is known 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
we incur and bill for freight  packaging  and certain other distribution costs only when we are responsible for such costs  however  many customers arrange for and pay for these costs directly 
application of this policy requires that we make estimates regarding creditworthiness of the customer  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition  and ultimately  the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make those estimates based on the most recent information available and historical experience  but they may be affected by subsequent changes in market conditions 
property  plant and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at historical cost or at the allocated values determined upon acquisition of business entities 
expenditures for property  plant  and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized  provided the expenditure extends the useful life of an asset or extends the asset s functionality 
property  plant  and equipment are depreciated under the straight line method using estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives range from to years 
useful lives are reviewed periodically and changed as necessary 
gains or losses from normal sales  disposals  or retirements of assets are included in other within operating income 
mineral properties and development costs mineral properties and development costs  which are referred to collectively as mineral properties  include acquisition costs  the cost of drilling wells  and the cost of other development work  all of which are capitalized 
depletion of mineral properties is calculated using the units of production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body 
the lives of reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations prepared by us  and reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants  due to uncertainties inherent in long term estimates 
reserve studies and mine plans are updated periodically  and the remaining net balance of the mineral properties is depleted over the updated estimated life  subject to a year limit 
possible impairment is also considered in conjunction with updated reserve studies and mine plans 
our proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling  sampling  mine modeling  and mineral recovery from which economic feasibility has been determined 
the price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including ore grade  ore thickness  and ore mineral composition 
the reserves are estimated based on information available at the time the reserves are calculated 
recovery rates vary depending on the mineral properties of each deposit and the production process used 
the reserve estimate utilizes the average recovery rate for the deposit  which takes into account the processing methods scheduled to be used 
the cutoff grade  or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process  varies with material type  mineral recoveries  operating costs  and expected selling price 
proven and probable reserves are based on estimates  and no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of potash and langbeinite will be realized or that production costs and estimated future development costs will not exceed the net realizable value of the products 
tons of potash and langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves are expressed in terms of expected finished tons of product to be realized  net of estimated losses 
reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience 
market price fluctuations of potash or trio  as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates  could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves 
in addition  the provisions of our mineral leases  including royalties payable  are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government  
table of contents which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates 
significant changes in the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
inventory inventory consists of product and by product stocks which are ready for sale  mined ore  potash in evaporation ponds  and parts and supplies inventory 
product and by product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  we adjust our inventory balance accordingly 
if the actual sales price ultimately realized were to be less than our estimate of net realizable value  additional losses would be incurred in the period of liquidation 
cost includes direct costs  maintenance  operational overhead  depreciation  depletion  and equipment lease costs applicable to the production process 
direct costs  maintenance  and operational overhead include labor and associated benefits 
the value of potash within the solar ponds  which is considered work in process inventory  is estimated based on the amount of finished inventory expected to be recovered and the lower of cost incurred through the stage of completion or net realizable value less costs to complete the process 
significant estimates are used in the allocation of costs to different products  including by products 
we evaluate production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal  and therefore excluded from inventory costs 
if our analysis concludes that production levels or costs during a certain period are deemed abnormal  the associated costs will be excluded from inventory and instead expensed during the applicable periods 
the assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and is unique to each period 
we model normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in assessing what is deemed to be normal 
we also conduct detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of parts inventory  giving consideration to quality  slow moving items  obsolescence  excessive levels  and other factors 
parts inventories not having turned over in more than a year  excluding parts classified as critical spares  are reviewed for obsolescence and included in the determination of an allowance for obsolescence 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if an asset s total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates or fair values of assets may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
factors we generally will consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long lived assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  the denial or delay of necessary permits or approvals that would affect the utilization of our tangible assets  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of certain products by us or our customers  a decrease in estimated mineral reserves  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
although we believe the carrying values of our long lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates  future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 

table of contents asset retirement obligation all of our mining properties involve certain reclamation liabilities as required by the states in which they operate or by the blm 
these asset retirement obligations are reviewed and updated at least annually with any changes in balances recorded as adjustments to the related assets and liabilities 
changes in estimates result from changes in estimated probabilities  amounts  refinements in scope  technological developments  and timing of the settlement of the asset retirement obligation  as well as changes in the legal requirements of an obligation 
the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
scheduled maintenance each operation typically shuts down periodically for maintenance 
the nm operations have historically shut down for up to two weeks to perform turnaround maintenance 
generally  the moab and wendover operations cease harvesting potash from our solar ponds during one or more summer months to make the most of the evaporation season 
during these summer turnarounds  annual maintenance is performed 
the costs of maintenance turnarounds are considered part of production costs and are absorbed into inventory in the period incurred 
income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and therefore are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized in full  such determinations are subject to ongoing assessment 
with respect to the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes  we follow the accounting guidance of topic  income taxes  of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification 
this guidance addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as well as disclosure requirements associated with such positions 
a current assessment of our tax positions has been made  and  as a result  there has been no material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
before completion of the ipo in april  mining operated as a limited liability company  which did not pay federal or state income taxes 
mining s taxable income or loss has been included in the state and federal tax returns of its members 
derivatives on occasion  we enter into financial derivative contracts to fix a portion of our natural gas costs when natural gas purchase transactions are probable and the significant characteristics and expected timing are identified 
these derivative contracts have not been designated as an accounting hedge  and changes in their fair market values have been included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from the natural gas derivative contracts are recorded as a component of natural gas expense within cost of sales 
we also entered into interest rate derivative instruments when we had outstanding debt  in order to swap a portion of floating rate debt to fixed rate when borrowings were probable and the significant characteristics and expected timing were identified 
these items were not accounted for as hedge items  accordingly  any change in fair value from period to period associated with realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivative contracts is shown within interest expense 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by recording expense using the fair value of the awards at the time of grant 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with the issuance of non vested restricted common stock awards with service conditions and non qualified stock option awards that are subject to a service period  and the expense associated with 
table of contents such awards is recognized over the associated service period 
there are no performance or market conditions associated with these awards 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or non recurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations may be impacted by commodity prices  geographic concentration  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity prices potash and trio  our principal products  are commodities but are not traded on any commodity exchange 
as such  direct hedging of the prices for future production cannot be undertaken 
generally  we do not enter into long term sales contracts with customers  so prices will vary with each particular transaction and the individual bids that we receive 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets which are the agricultural market as a fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling fluids for oil and gas exploration  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
prices will vary based upon the demand from these different markets 
our net sales and profitability are determined principally by the price of potash and trio and  to a lesser extent  by the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash and langbeinite 
the price of potash and trio is influenced by agricultural demand and the prices of agricultural commodities 
decreases in agricultural demand or agricultural commodity prices could reduce our agricultural potash and trio sales 
if natural gas and oil prices were to decline enough to result in a reduction in drilling activity  our industrial potash sales would decline 
our costs and capital investments are subject to market movements in other commodities such as natural gas  steel  and chemicals 
we have entered into derivative transactions for the purchase of natural gas in the past 
as of december   we had no natural gas derivative contracts 
we did  however  enter into a contract during the fourth quarter of that provides for a fixed price on the majority of our daily natural gas needs in new mexico for eleven months 
geographic concentration we primarily sell potash into the regions that include agricultural areas west of the mississippi river  oil and gas exploration areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin  and feedlots in texas and other southwestern and western states 
our potash mines and many of our customers are concentrated in the western united states and are  therefore  affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
interest rate fluctuations our senior credit facility requires us to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of derivatives when we have long term debt outstanding 
although we currently have no long term 
table of contents debt outstanding  we have left in place certain derivative contracts that were entered into at a time when we did have long term debt outstanding 
the weighted average notional amount outstanding as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives through december were million and percent  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rates we typically have low balances of accounts receivable denominated in canadian dollars  and  as a result  we have minimal direct foreign exchange risk 
there is an indirect foreign exchange risk as described below 
the united states imports the majority of its potash from canada and russia 
if the canadian dollar and the russian ruble strengthen in comparison to the us dollar  foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin as measured in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal us dollar prices 
strengthening of the canadian dollar and russian ruble therefore tend to support higher us potash prices as canadian and russian potash producers attempt to maintain their margins 
however  if the canadian dollar and russian ruble weaken in comparison to the us dollar  foreign competitors may choose to lower prices significantly to increase sales volumes while again maintaining margins as measured in their local currencies 
a decrease in the average net realized sales price of our potash would adversely affect our operating results
