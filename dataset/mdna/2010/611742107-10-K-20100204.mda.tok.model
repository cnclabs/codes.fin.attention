diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased approximately million shares  primarily as a result of the repurchase of million shares of common stock since october and a lower average share price 
our diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was in  compared to a loss of in  which was primarily related to the wind down of the tickle operations financial condition the following table details our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash flow components years ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable securities current and non current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities percentage of total assets our borrowings under our credit facility decreased in the fiscal year ended december  to million from million as of december  consolidated cash flows for the fiscal year ended december  and are as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations cash provided by used for investing activities of continuing operations cash used for financing activities of continuing operations cash used in discontinued operations effect of exchange rates on cash 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have relied on funds provided by operating activities  equity offerings  short and long term borrowings and seller financed notes to meet our liquidity needs 
we invest our excess cash predominantly in bank time deposits  money market funds and commercial paper that matures within three months of its origination date and in marketable securities  which are usually highly liquid and are of high quality investment grade with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating and strategic long term investment purposes 
due to the state of the financial markets  we redeployed our excess cash during and in conservative investment vehicles such as money market funds that invest solely in us treasuries  top foreign sovereign debt obligations  bank deposits at prime money center banks and municipal bonds 
we are actively monitoring the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we have available for sale marketable securities primarily invested in tax exempt auction rate bonds 
as a result of persistent failed auctions beginning in february  and the uncertainty of when these investments could be successfully liquidated at par  we have classified all of these investments in auction rate bonds as available for sale securities  which are recorded as non current marketable securities with the exception of the million par value auction rate securities marketed and sold by ubs ag and its affiliates collectively  ubs as of december   as described below in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  during  we redeemed certain of our auction rate securities entirely at par 
additionally  in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with rbc with respect to auction rate securities purchased from rbc 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  rbc immediately repurchased the subject auction rate securities from us at a certain discount to their par value 
the company will receive certain additional monies from rbc if  within a certain time period from the date of the execution of the settlement agreement  any of the auction rate securities still held by rbc are redeemed or refinanced by the issuer for sums higher than the amounts rbc paid the company to repurchase such auction rate securities 
as part of the settlement agreement  the company dismissed its lawsuit against rbc and released claims related to rbc s sale of the auction rate securities to the company 
accordingly  the company recorded a realized loss of million in the fourth quarter of relating to the settlement with rbc  which was reflected in interest and other  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   we held million at par and cost value of investments in auction rate securities 
these securities are variable rate debt instruments whose underlying agreements have contractual maturities of up to years and have been issued by state related higher education agencies and are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us department of education 
while we continue to earn interest on our auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate which was a blended rate of at december  and there has been no payment default with respect to such securities  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates par value 
to estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities  we used third party valuation and other available market observables that considered  among other factors  a the credit quality of the underlying collateral typically student loans  b the financial strength of the counterparties typically state related higher education agencies and the guarantors including the us department of education  c an estimate of when the next successful auction date will occur  and d the formula applicable to each security which defines the interest rate paid to investors in the event of a failed auction  forward projections of the interest rate benchmarks specified in such formulas  a tax exempt discount margin for the cash flow discount and all applicable embedded options such as the put  call and sinking fund features 
we also used available data sources for market observables  which were primarily derived from third party research provided by or available from well recognized research entities and sources 
to the extent market observables were not available as of the valuation date  a statistical model was used to project the variables based on the historical data and in cases where historical data was not available comparable securities or a benchmark index was identified and used for estimation 
when comparable securities or a benchmark index were not available  industrial averages were used or standard assumptions based on industry practices were used 
based on these valuations  we wrote down the auction rate securities with an original par value and cost of million to an estimated fair value of million as of december  the write down of these securities resulted in an unrealized loss of million  reported in interest and other  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  due to the impairment being other than temporary 

table of contents included in the company s auction rate securities portfolio are approximately million of auction rate securities which were marketed and sold by ubs 
on november   the company accepted a settlement with ubs pursuant to which ubs issued to the company series c auction rate securities rights the ars rights 
the ars rights provide the company the right to receive the par value of our ubs brokered auction rate securities plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the settlement provides that the company may require ubs to purchase its ubs brokered auction rate securities at par value at any time between june  and july  the ars rights are not transferable  tradable or marginable  and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network 
as part of the settlement  ubs agrees to provide loans through june  up to of the market value  as determined by ubs  of the ubs brokered auction rate securities which the company will pledge as collateral 
the interest rates for such ubs loans will be equivalent to the interest rate we earn on our ubs brokered auction rate securities 
accordingly  the company has recorded the unrealized losses of million as a charge to interest and other  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  due to the impairment being other than temporary 
since the company may require ubs to purchase its ubs brokered auction rate securities at par value at any time beginning on june   the company has classified the fair value of these ubs brokered auction rate securities as current in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  revolving credit facilities and cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures and meet our investment requirements and commitments through at least the next twelve months 
our cash generated from operating activities is subject to fluctuations in the global economy and unemployment rates

level is defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level is defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
in determining fair value  the company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible  as well as considering counter party credit risk in its assessment of fair value
