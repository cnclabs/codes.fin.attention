operational risk management operational risks exist in most areas of the company from clearing to customer service 
while we make every effort to protect against failures in the internal controls system  no system is completely fail proof 
loss of company and customer assets due to fraud represents one of our most significant operational risks 
fraud losses typically result from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources 
we monitor customer transactions and use scoring tools which prevent a significant number of fraudulent transactions on a daily basis 
however  new techniques and strategies are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud 
in order to minimize this threat  we offer our customers various security measures  including a token based multi factor verification system 
this token creates a unique password which changes every sixty seconds and must be used along with the customer s self selected password to access their account 
we believe this system is an extremely effective tool for preventing unauthorized access to a customer s account 
the failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities could result in financial loss and impact our reputation 
the vendor management group monitors our vendor relationships and arrangements 
the vendor risk identification process includes reviews of contracts  financial soundness of providers  information security and business continuity 

table of contents processing issues and external events may result in opportunity loss depending on the situation 
these types of losses include issues resulting from human error  equipment failures  significant weather events or other related types of events 
external events resulting in actual losses could be due to internet performance issues  litigation  change in public policy and our reputation 
concentrations of credit risk loans we track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolio  which is primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate 
these factors  which are documented at the time of origination  include borrowers debt to income ratio  borrowers credit scores  housing prices  documentation type  occupancy type  and loan type 
we also review estimated current loan to value ltv ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios 
in economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate  we believe that loan type  ltv ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance 
in the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance  we believe the ltv ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk 
we believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and or features of the loan 
two of these categories are sub prime and option adjustable rate mortgages arm loans 
as a general matter  we did not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet  however  in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans  we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub prime loans 
as of december   sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option arm loans 
as noted above  we believe loan type  ltv ratios and borrowers credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance 
our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans on residential real estate properties  which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans 
we believe home equity loans with a combined loan to value cltv of or higher or a fair isaac credit organization fico score below are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios 
approximately of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position 
for home equity loans that are in a second lien position  we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than of the loans in this portfolio 

table of contents the breakdown by current ltv cltv and fico score of our two main loan portfolios  one to four family and home equity  are as follows dollars in millions one to four family home equity current ltv cltv december  december  december  december  total real estate loans average estimated current ltv cltv average ltv cltv at loan origination current cltv calculations for home equity are based on drawn balances 
current property values are updated on a quarterly basis using the most recent property value data available to us 
for properties in which we did not have an updated valuation  we utilized home price indices to estimate the current property value 
the average estimated current ltv ratio reflects the outstanding balance at the balance sheet date  divided by the estimated current property value 
average ltv cltv at loan origination calculations are based on ltv cltv at time of purchase for one to four family purchased loans and undrawn balances for home equity loans 
one to four family home equity current fico december  december  december  december  total real estate loans fico scores are updated on a quarterly basis  however  as of december   there were some loans for which the updated fico scores were not available 
the current fico distribution as of december  included original fico scores for approximately million and million of one to four family and home equity loans  respectively 
in addition to the factors described above  we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel  vintage and geographic location  which are summarized below as of december  and dollars in millions one to four family home equity acquisition channel december  december  december  december  purchased from a third party originated by the company total real estate loans

no other state had concentrations of real estate loans that represented or more of the company s real estate portfolio 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency levels and trends  current and historical charge off and loss experience  current industry charge off and loss experience  the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio  the interest rate climate  the overall availability of housing credit  and general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management s estimate of loan charge offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the estimated charge offs  including economic concessions to borrowers  over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in tdrs 
determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
we believe our allowance for loan losses at december  is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the general allowance for loan losses also included a specific qualitative component to account for environmental factors that we believe will impact our level of credit losses 
this qualitative component  which was applied by loan type  reflects our estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio due to environmental factors which are not directly considered in our quantitative loss model but are factors we believe will have an impact on credit losses eg the current level of unemployment 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans 
however  the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 

table of contents the following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category dollars in millions one to four family home equity consumer and other total allowance allowance as a of loans receivable allowance allowance as a of loans receivable allowance allowance as a of loans receivable allowance allowance as a of loans receivable december  december  allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category 
during the year ended december   the allowance for loan losses increased by million from the level at december  this increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the one to four family loan portfolio  which began to deteriorate during however  the majority of the allowance as of december  related to the home equity portfolio  which began to deteriorate during the second half of we believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors  including home price depreciation in key markets  growing inventories of unsold homes  rising foreclosure rates  significant contraction in the availability of credit  and a general decline in economic growth 
in addition  the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans 
although we expect these factors will cause the provision for loan losses to continue at elevated levels in future periods  the level of provision for loan losses has declined for five consecutive quarters 
while we cannot state with certainty that this trend will continue  we believe it is a positive indicator that our loan portfolio has continued to stabilize 
included in our allowance for loan losses at december  was a specific allowance of million that was established for tdrs 
the specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss  including the economic concession to the borrower  over the remaining life of the loan

these charge offs were recorded primarily on loans that were delinquent in excess of days prior to the loan modification

loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred 
our policy for both one to four family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for days or is in bankruptcy  regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure  and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value less costs to sell 
our policy is to charge off credit cards when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for days and to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable 

table of contents net charge offs for the year ended december  compared to increased by million 
the overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge offs on our one to four family loans and home equity loans  which were driven mainly by the same factors as described above 
we believe net charge offs will decline in future periods when compared to the level of charge offs in the three months ended december  as a result of our decline in special mention delinquencies  which is discussed below 
the following graph illustrates the net charge offs by quarter logo 
table of contents nonperforming assets we classify loans as nonperforming when they are days past due 
the following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets dollars in millions year ended december  one to four family home equity consumer and other total nonperforming loans real estate owned reo and other repossessed assets  net total nonperforming assets  net nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable one to four family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one to four family nonperforming loans receivable home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans receivable consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans receivable total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable during the year ended december   our nonperforming assets  net increased million to billion when compared to december  the increase was attributed primarily to a million increase in our one to four family loans delinquent in excess of days for the year ended december  when compared to december  this increase was due primarily to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market 

table of contents the following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter logo the allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable  net decreased from at december  to at december  this decrease was driven by an increase in one to four family nonperforming loans  which have a lower level of expected loss when compared to home equity loans as one to four family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets 
the balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent to days as well as loans delinquent days and greater 
we believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value  whereas loans delinquent to days have not 
we believe loans delinquent to days is an important measure because these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge offs 
additional charge offs on loans delinquent days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations  but we do not anticipate these charge offs to be significant  particularly when compared to the expected charge offs on loans delinquent to days 
we expect the balances of one to four family loans delinquent days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market 

table of contents the following graph shows the loans delinquent to days for each of our major loan categories logo in addition to nonperforming assets  we monitor loans where a borrower s past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan special mention loans 
we classify loans as special mention when they are between and days past due 
the following table shows the comparative data for special mention loans dollars in millions december  one to four family home equity consumer and other total special mention loans special mention loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable the trend in special mention loan balances are generally indicative of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods  as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off 
one to four family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets  reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan 
our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets  however  the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position  which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position 

table of contents during the year ended december   special mention loans decreased by million to million 
this decrease was largely due to a decrease in home equity special mention loans 
the decrease in home equity special mention loans includes the impact of our loan modification programs in which borrowers who were to days past due were made current 
while our level of special mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period  we believe the decrease we observed in is an encouraging sign regarding the future credit performance of this portfolio 
the following graph illustrates the special mention loans by quarter logo loans modified as tdrs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made in accordance with the modified terms 

table of contents securities we focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios 
we believe our highest concentration of credit risk within this portfolio is the non agency cmo portfolio 
the table below details the amortized cost by average credit ratings and type of asset as of december  and dollars in millions december  aaa aa a bbb below investment grade and non rated total agency mortgage backed securities and cmos agency debentures non agency cmos and other municipal bonds  corporate bonds and fhlb stock total december  aaa aa a bbb below investment grade and non rated total agency mortgage backed securities agency debentures non agency cmos and other municipal bonds  corporate bonds and fhlb stock total while the vast majority of this portfolio is aaa rated  we concluded during the year ended december  that approximately million of the non agency cmos in this portfolio were other than temporarily impaired 
as a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities  they were written down by recording million of net impairment during the year ended december  further declines in the performance of our non agency cmo portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods 
derivatives credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities  including derivative instruments 
we monitor the collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements  which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events 
we considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments  particularly those in net liability positions  to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements  and the collateral requirements therein 
our credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations 
during the year ended december   the consideration of credit risk  the company s or the counterparty s  did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments
