item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe card products and solutions 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer sort and test on the semiconductor die  or chips  on the whole semiconductor wafer  which is prior to singulation of the wafer into individual separate chips 
we work closely with our customers on product design  as each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our proprietary technology  including our microspring interconnect technology 
the overall global economic downturn and uncertainty in fiscal had a significant impact on global semiconductor device manufacturing  which  coupled with an oversupply of memory devices  resulted in a significant decrease in demand and a challenging environment for our advanced wafer probe cards 
our revenues declined by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this revenue decline was in each of the product markets we address dynamic random access memory  or dram  nand and nor flash memory and system on a chip  or soc 
these results were due to a number of factors including the relative supply and demand of various semiconductor devices and end products incorporating those devices  semiconductor manufacturers efforts to curtail spending and conserve cash by taking capacity offline  reducing production  delaying the transition to new technology nodes and postponing the implementation of tooling cycles 
we incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net loss increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower revenues across all market segments as well as reduced gross margins on product sales 
results for fiscal also included the recognition of a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets  restructuring charges of million  million in a stock based compensation charge related to an option modification in connection with the retirement of our founder and former executive chairman of our board of directors in may  as well as million in provision for bad debts due to the heightened risk of non payment of certain accounts receivable 
net loss for fiscal included million in restructuring and impairment charges and million in provision for doubtful debts 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately million as of december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was primarily due to the use of cash for operating activities in fiscal we also paid million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the acquisition of manufacturing and testing equipment and technology assets  including intellectual property assets  from electroglas  inc we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in fiscal 
table of contents in response to the continued deterioration in semiconductor market conditions  we are focusing on aligning our operations and improving our operating efficiency to achieve operating cash flow break even in the current business environment and to better position our company for long term  profitable growth 
in january  we initiated a global reorganization and cost reduction plan designed to lower the company s cash breakeven level in order to enable us to sustain ourselves financially in the current market environment 
as part of the plan  we reduced our workforce by 
we also implemented certain non severance measures that we expect to result in future cost savings 
we also incurred restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we continued our efforts to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate 
in addition  we are restructuring our operations through our global regionalization strategy by  for example  placing more decision making in regions close to our semiconductor customers  and strengthening our local design  application and service capabilities to improve customer responsiveness and enhance our relationships with our customers 
we are also changing our manufacturing structure to realize a shorter cycle time and improved product delivery capabilities 
we have accelerated our regionalization efforts by bringing up back end manufacturing operations in asia 
we qualified our back end manufacturing in korea during our first quarter of fiscal  and in japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal we currently plan to qualify a significant portion of our front end manufacturing operations in singapore in fiscal the combination of these initiatives is intended to result in a lower manufacturing cost  a simplified manufacturing process and decreased cycle times for our customers 
we believe the following information is important to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
fiscal years ended december   december  and december  had weeks each 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
revenues from our customers are subject to fluctuations due to factors including  but not limited to  design cycles  technology adoption rates  competitive pressure to reduce prices  cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold and market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
historically  increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll  shipping and handling costs and  manufacturing related overhead 
our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell a custom product into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design of a customer and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolete and non saleable 
table of contents inventories based on assumptions about future demand  changes to manufacturing processes  and overall market conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to improve and enhance existing technologies and to develop new technologies for current and new markets and for new applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  provision for doubtful accounts  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  and administrative activities 
these expenses also include costs for protecting and enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges include expenses related to employee termination severance pay and benefits  and property and equipment impairment charges incurred as part of our cost reduction plans 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates may change as new information is obtained 
significant items that are subject to such estimates include the fair value of revenue elements  fair value of marketable securities  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for product warranty  valuation of obsolete and slow moving inventory  valuation of intangible assets  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  valuation and recognition of stock based compensation  provision for income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and  tax liabilities and accruals for other liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations reported in our financial statements and related disclosures 
we have identified the following accounting policies as being critical because they require our management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our management has discussed the development  selection  application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services are rendered  the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of our product is specified by our customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

table of contents in multiple element arrangements  we determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting based on relative fair value of individual elements 
we offer product maintenance and repair arrangements to our customers 
amounts due from our customers under these arrangements are initially recorded as deferred revenues 
the fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period and related costs are recorded as incurred 
revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have been insignificant to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
warranty accrual we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record adjustments to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolescence or non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
we take into consideration any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
we estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap to determine whether there is a need for a valuation allowance with respect to such deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider available positive and negative evidence giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income and  commensurate with objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in july  the fasb issued guidance regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  which we adopted the first quarter of fiscal income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
this interpretation provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal and state  and foreign tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
stock based compensation under provisions of accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
the most significant assumptions impacted by management s judgment are the expected volatility and the expected life of the options 
the expected dividend yield  and expected risk free interest rate are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
in addition  adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based payment awards that we expect to vest did have a significant impact on the recorded share based compensation expense 
expected volatility the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of traded options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that 
table of contents implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 
expected life and forfeiture rate the expected life also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  longer option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  employees are not required to wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  we are required to estimate the expected term of the option 
we determine the expected life by considering several factors  including historical option exercise behavior  post vesting turnover rates and terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
similarly  we base our estimate of forfeiture on historical option cancellation behavior including pre vesting turnover rates

for 
table of contents certain of our products we also experienced pricing pressure due to the availability of competitive products  which also contributed to the decrease in revenues 
our revenues for the year ended december  were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues for our products that address the dram segment declined in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a number of factors including the relative supply and demand of various semiconductor devices and end products incorporating those devices  semiconductor manufacturers efforts to curtail spending and conserve cash by taking capacity offline  reducing production  delaying the transition to new technology nodes and postponing the implementation of tooling cycles 
we also experienced pricing pressure on certain dram test products due to the competitive environment 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also decreased significantly in the year ended december  compared to the prior year  with the decrease driven by sales declines in both nor and nand flash wafer probe cards 
the weakness in nor flash can be attributed to a decline in purchases by certain key customers  specifically from our largest nor customer filing for bankruptcy protection in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  revenues from nand flash wafer probe cards declined as nand flash memory device manufacturers significantly reduced their output in the first quarter of fiscal  in an attempt to promote industry absorption of excess inventories 
revenues from manufacturers of soc devices decreased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the overall downturn in the semiconductor industry which negatively impacted the revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards 
revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands japan north america asia pacific europe total revenues geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the customer product 
for example  certain south korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries and accordingly  if the product is shipped to an address in south korea it is reflected in the revenue for asia pacific 
the decrease in revenues across all geographic regions for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in sales in those regions in each of the product markets we address dram  flash memory and soc 
additionally  revenues decreased due generally to the semiconductor industry downturn  characterized by weak demand for semiconductor devices  delayed production ramps and weak device pricing environments 

table of contents gross profit loss fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit loss gross margin gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading  and material costs 
for the year ended december   gross margin declined compared to the prior year  primarily due to the significant decline in revenue driving lower factory utilization  thereby increasing unit manufacturing costs  combined with declines in average selling prices as well as an unfavorable change in product mix from higher margin to lower margin products 
this decline was partially mitigated by lower personnel costs as a result of our fiscal and global cost reduction plans as well as a decline in inventory write downs 
inventory charge offs decreased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the higher inventory write downs in fiscal were associated with deterioration in the dram memory segment in that period 
inventory write downs declined in fiscal despite the continued deterioration in the dram memory segment primarily due to stronger inventory management in fiscal excess custom inventories are not uncommon for us as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  which requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
stock based compensation included in gross margin was million or of revenues  in the year ended december  and million  or of revenues for the year ended december  the decline of stock based compensation  in absolute dollars  was primarily as a result of reductions in headcount as a result of our and global cost reduction plans 
in the near future  our gross margins will likely continue to be adversely affected by lower levels of product revenues in comparison to the same periods in the prior fiscal year  even though we have taken significant steps to reduce our production levels and operating cost structure 
additionally  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
also  as part of our global regionalization strategy  we continued our efforts to transition back end manufacturing to asia in fiscal we qualified our back end manufacturing in korea and japan during fiscal  and plan to qualify front end manufacturing operations in singapore in fiscal this initiative is intended  in part  to reduce manufacturing costs 
however  as we go through our ramp up of new technologies over the coming quarters  we will see associated costs related to the transition and to the ramp of new technologies before we more fully experience the benefits of lower manufacturing costs by the second half of fiscal research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in certain new technology product development related costs  personnel costs  and depreciation  facilities and information technology costs 
for the year ended december   personnel costs decreased 
table of contents million primarily due to reductions in headcount as a result of our global reorganization plans 
expenses related to new technology and product development remained flat  and depreciation and facilities and information technology costs decreased million  primarily due to the implementation of corporate cost reduction initiatives 
stock based compensation included within research and development was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in stock based compensation in absolute dollars was primarily due to reductions in headcount resulting from the and global cost reduction plans 
as a percent of revenues  research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the declining revenue base

we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies 
selling  general and administrative fiscal fiscal in thousands selling  general and administrative of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs and other discretionary spending 
for the year ended december   personnel related costs decreased by approximately million  primarily due to the work force reductions as well as lower discretionary spending 
outside legal and other professional fees decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily to a decrease in legal fees 
the decrease in legal fees for the year ended december  was primarily due to the scheduling of the international trade commission hearing on the investigation ta of two of our competitors which arose out of our complaint filed in late the majority of the fees and costs related to the hearing and post hearing activities were completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million and million in the year ended december  and december   respectively 
we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts primarily due to the heightened risk of non payment of accounts receivable by certain customers facing financial difficulty 
in addition  stock based compensation included within selling  general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in stock based compensation for the year ended december  was due to an option modification expense of million in connection with the retirement of dr

restructuring charges fiscal fiscal in thousands restructuring charges of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented the q restructuring plan that included reducing our global workforce by 
the q restructuring plan extended the cost reduction plans implemented during fiscal and impacted employees across all functions of the organization 
the q restructuring plan consisted primarily of involuntary employee terminations and benefit costs and write down of certain assets taken out of service 
we recorded million in relation to the q restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal and an additional million in the second quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred further restructuring charges of million  related to further reductions in our global workforce in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate 
we anticipate that the balance of the employee related charges resulting from the cost reduction plans implemented in fiscal will be paid within the next six months 
we expect to realize quarterly savings  excluding stock based compensation expense  of approximately million as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal in both the first and second quarters of fiscal  we implemented global cost reduction plans that included reducing our global workforce 
the first quarter action also included facility consolidation charges related to vacating buildings in livermore  california 
both plans were implemented to restructure our company to better align with the market environment 
all expenses  including adjustments associated with our restructuring plans are included in restructuring in the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we paid million  representing substantially all of the employee related expenses for the cost reduction plans and million primarily related to a non cancellable contract

provision for benefit from income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes effective tax rate in fiscal we recorded a tax benefit for us losses  tax credits and deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  in accordance with accounting requirements  a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets was recorded 
our tax rate was thus negatively impacted by a valuation allowance of million and non us net operating losses  primarily in singapore  of million 
in november   president obama signed into law the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of this law extended net operating loss carrybacks from two years to five years 
we benefited from this provision by increasing our refund claim to prior years for the carryback of our federal tax loss by approximately million prior to the law change 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we considered available positive and negative evidence giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income and commensurate with our objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
under current tax laws  this valuation allowance will not limit our ability to utilize federal and state deferred tax assets provided we can generate sufficient future taxable income 
we anticipate we will continue to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain jurisdictions  primarily federal and state  until such time as we are able to determine it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized 
such position is dependent on whether there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize such deferred tax assets 
we expect our future tax provisions  during the time such valuation allowances are recorded  will consist primarily of the tax provision of our profitable non us jurisdictions 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision 
we recognized interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and non us tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as of december   changes to our uncertain tax positions in the next months  that are reasonably possible  are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

our revenues for fiscal were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues for our products that address the dram segment decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to weak market conditions in which dram device pricing fell precipitously  to pricing pressure from our customers on certain of our dram products due to the competitive environment  and from increased competition 
given the price trend of dram devices in fiscal  our customers that manufacture dram devices took certain actions to curtail spending and conserve cash  including decisions to delay test capacity expansions and ramping of key devices 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to sales decline of our nor flash wafer probe cards in light of the reduced product ordering pattern of one of our primary nor flash device customers  to pricing pressure from our customers on certain of our flash products due to the competitive environment  and from increased competition for full wafer contactor products in the nand flash market 
market conditions for flash memory devices weakened during fiscal and  as a consequence  our customers that manufacture flash memory devices took certain actions similar to our dram customers which 
in turn  impacted the demand for our products 
the weakness in nor flash can be attributed to certain key customers pushing their production ramp of nanometer into we also experienced market share reduction as a result of pricing pressure on certain flash memory products due to the competitive environment 
revenues from manufacturers of soc devices decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to delayed production ramp of a key customer s ongoing transition to advanced technology nodes in both chipset application and high performance flip chip microprocessors  which are used in personal computer  gaming and graphics applications

table of contents on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law 
under this law  the research tax credit was retroactively extended through january  from december  this extension of the credit benefited our fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate by less than one percentage point 
the california budget bill assembly bill  enacted on september   resulted in two temporary changes to the california income tax 
first  the bill suspends the use of net operating loss carryovers for the fiscal and second  the bill limits the use of research tax credit carryovers to no more than of the tax liability before credits 
while these changes did not affect our effective tax rate  they may impact our tax provision depending on our profitability in liquidity and capital resources fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities working capital the decrease in working capital in the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances due to use of cash for operating and investing activities  a decrease in deferred tax assets due to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the second quarter of fiscal  offset in part by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities include million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  day sales outstanding days sales outstanding from receivables  or dso  were days at december  compared with days at december  our dso calculation is calculated using the countback method and is based on gross accounts receivable including accounts receivable for amounts in deferred revenue 
the increase in dso is primarily due to the significant shift to longer payment terms for several customers 
fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily driven by our operating loss of million offset in part by non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  deferred income tax benefit of million  provision for doubtful accounts receivable of million and provision for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december  was million consisting primarily of  an increase in deferred revenues due to lengthening of payment terms for certain customers  a decrease in refundable income taxes primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds in fiscal  as well as a decrease in prepaids and other current assets 

table of contents this was offset in part by an increase in inventories due to lower shipments and a decrease in accounts payable and accruals 
cash flows from investing activities the cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily relate to the purchase of marketable securities  net of receipts from the sales and maturities thereof as well as cash used for capital expenditures in support of information technology system upgrades and new product technology 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  also included million of consideration paid for the purchase of manufacturing and testing equipment and technology assets from electroglas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we carefully monitor our investments to minimize risks and have not experienced other than temporary investment losses 
except for experiencing declining yields  our investment portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the ongoing economic turmoil in the credit markets 
cash flows from financing activities the cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  are primarily due to million received in fiscal for purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp and net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows from financing activities also included proceeds of million from the sale of certain receivables  which was accounted for as a secured borrowing see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities declined in fiscal given the uncertainty in the global economy and the downturn in the semiconductor industry coupled with the decrease in demand for our products  we are focusing on improving our operating efficiency to achieve break even operating cash flow 
our actions have included operational expense reduction initiatives  re timing or eliminating certain capital spending and research and development projects and re negotiating longer payment terms with our vendors 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are also considering establishing manufacturing and technology partnerships  or to seek short and long term debt obligations  or to obtain new financing facilities which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
however  if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in fiscal the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due in fiscal years after total in thousands operating leases other purchase obligations total other purchase obligations are primarily for purchases of inventory 
for the purposes of this table  other purchase obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents the table above excludes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million as of december  and are classified as deferred and other long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement period for our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  it is not expected to be due within the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have not participated in transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any such off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification agreements we may  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations 
under these contractual arrangements  we have agreed to defend  indemnify and or hold the third party harmless from and against certain liabilities 
these arrangements include indemnities in favor of customers in the event that our wafer probe cards infringe a third party s intellectual property and our lessors in connection with facility leasehold liabilities that we may cause 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors  and with persons who were at one time our directors  and certain of our officers  and our bylaws contain indemnification obligations in favor of our directors  officers and agents 
these indemnity arrangements may limit the type of the claim  the total amount that we can be required to pay in connection with the indemnification obligation and the time within which an indemnification claim can be made 
the duration of the indemnification obligation may vary  and for most arrangements  survives the agreement term and is indefinite 
we believe that substantially all of our indemnity arrangements provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
however  it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations  the history of prior indemnification claims  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification  and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable 
we have not had any requests for indemnification under these arrangements 
our management believes that any liability for these indemnity arrangements would not be material to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification arrangements on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  recent accounting pronouncements please refer to the discussion of our recent accounting pronouncements in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item in this form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion  but not all  of existing foreign currency denominated amounts 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recognized 
table of contents a net gain of million for the fiscal year ended december   from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts in our financial statements under other expense 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes  municipal bonds and notes and money market funds and commercial paper 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer  except us treasuries and us agencies 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at december  would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than million
