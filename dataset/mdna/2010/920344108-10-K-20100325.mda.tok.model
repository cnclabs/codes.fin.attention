item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and assess the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory we estimate the carrying value of our inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must estimate our income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  we do not have a valuation allowance at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in fut ure periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   a decrease of  from the december  level as our operations used cash of  and our investing activities used cash of  cash used in operations of  resulted from the net loss of  and a net cash outflow of  from changes in our operating assets and liabilities partially offset by the net positive adjustments of  for the non cash effects of depreciation and provisions for inventory  deferred income taxes and stock compensation 
the net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were mainly due to a  reduction in accrued liabilities offset in part by an  decrease in net inventory and a  increase in accounts payable 
the main items accounting for the net decrease in accrued liabilities were payments of  under the key employee bonus plan   for environmental liabilities of our discontinued operation   for federal income taxes and a reduction in accrued compensation of  the inventory decrease results from orders being filled from existing inventory and continued control over inventory purchases and levels required to support the current level of shipments and backlog to meet customer delivery requirements 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of inventory and equipment purchases 
capital expenditures amounted to  in our budget for capital expenditures is approximately  and is geared toward new production and test equipment capabilities in connection with the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
we believe that based on our current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations  our resources are sufficient to meet our financial needs and to fund our capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus our net sales decreased  from most product lines experienced sales decreases resulting primarily from a reduction in the overall number of units sold 
the sales reduction was mainly caused by both lower backlog levels at the beginning of compared to and lower bookings in compared to the order backlog at the beginning of the was  lower than at the beginning of and bookings for were  lower than in our backlog at december  amounted to  versus  at december  the decreases in bookings a nd the corresponding sales amounts are mainly due to the continuing general economic slowdown that began in the th quarter of and has negatively impacted the demand for our products 
our gross profit in decreased  from the amount and as a percentage of sales was compared to in the main factors contributing equally to the gross profit percentage decrease were the unfavorable effect of spreading the fixed overhead costs over the lower sales volume and increased raw material costs that were mainly due to changes in the product mix of sales 
selling and advertising expenses decreased  from primarily as a result of reductions of  in commission expense to outside sales representatives and  in advertising expense partially offset by increases of  in travel expenses and  in employee compensation and benefits 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from mainly as a result of reductions of  in employee compensation and benefits and  in professional fees 
professional fees in included expenses incurred as the company considered possible strategic alternatives to increase shareholder value

ferrantino a lump sum retirement payment of  on november  and mr

research and development expenses increased  over the amount primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation expense of  and operating supplies of  during interest income decreased  from as a result of the average invested cash balance being approximately million lower in compared to and the effect of interest rates being approximately percentage points lower during in the th quarter of  the company paid a special one time cash dividend totaling  the combined federal and state income tax rate for is compared to in the rate differs from the expected combined rate of mainly due to the effects of non deductible stock option and meals and entertainment expenses 
the rate differs from the expected combined rate of mainly due to the effects of non deductible stock option and meals and entertainment expenses and the federal tax effects of state tax operating losses utilized 
we reported an operating loss of  in compared to an operating profit of  in the decrease in operating profit of  results from a  reduction in gross profit partially offset by a  reduction in operating expenses 
the lower gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in sales 
the reduction in operating expenses is net of an increase in non recurring retirement expense of  expense related to the retirement agreement with the former ceo 
interest income amounted to  in  compared to  in we reported a pre tax loss of  during compared to a pre tax profit of  in for  we reported a net loss of  versus net earnings of  in off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations during the normal course of business  we incur certain commitments to make future payments for the purchase of inventory  machinery and equipment and production supplies based on our projected requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  increase or decrease in interest income 
we purchase certain inventory from and sell product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where we purchase inventory or sell product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to us and the other involved parties
