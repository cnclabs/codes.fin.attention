please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in our annual report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchise and company operated restaurants 
as of january    or of our restaurants were franchised  representing in canada and in the united states 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants 
average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and average same store sales provide meaningful information to investors concerning the size of our system  the overall health and financial performance of the system  and the strength of our brand and franchisee base  which ultimately impacts our consolidated and segmented financial performance

executive overview we franchise  and to a much lesser extent  operate tim hortons restaurants in canada and the us as the franchisor  we collect royalty income from franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for most of our franchised restaurants 
as of january   we leased or owned the real estate for approximately of our system restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental income 
real estate that is not controlled by us is generally for non standard restaurants  including  for example  kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  and airports  as well as self serve kiosks located in gas and convenience locations and grocery stores 
we distribute coffee and other beverages  non perishable food  supplies  packaging and equipment to system restaurants in canada through our five distribution centres  and  in some cases  through third party distributors 
we supply frozen and some refrigerated products from our guelph facility to approximately of our ontario restaurants 
in the us  we supply similar products to system restaurants through third party distributors 
in addition to our canadian and us franchising business  we have licensed locations in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  which are mainly self serve kiosks operating primarily under the name tim hortons 
performance against targets the following table sets forth our actual performance as compared to our financial targets  as well as management s views on our performance relative to such targets measure target actual commentary same store sales canada us same store sales growth was driven by menu innovation  promotional  and operational programs and some pricing 
in addition  our co branding initiative with cold stone creamery was a significant contributor to our us same store sales results 
operating income growth operating income growth excluding the impact of the million in professional advisory and shareholder related costs associated with our public company reorganization was  which represents performance at the high end of our targeted range 
we believe that this level of growth is a better comparison of our operating income performance against our original targeted growth  which excluded the impact of such costs 
effective tax rate as of february updated as of september our original target did not include the impact of our public company reorganization  which added to our effective tax rate 
we were within the updated range which included the impact of the public company reorganization 
restaurant development canada us restaurants full serve restaurants restaurants restaurants canada new restaurant development was within the targeted range 
we achieved our us new restaurant development targets 
capital expenditures million million capital expenditures were lower than the targeted range due to changes in restaurant development formats and lease versus purchase financing decisions 
measure target actual commentary us operating income performance break even million operating income our us operating segment results exceeded the break even operating income target mainly as a result of the positive impact in from the closure of underperforming company operated restaurants  lower general and administrative costs and strong same store sales growth  which included the significant contribution from our co branding initiative with cold stone creamery 
our financial outlook is included under item business in this form k 
a major factor affecting businesses generally in was the continued macro economic challenges in north america  characterized by persistently high unemployment levels and other pressures in the us and in certain canadian regions that have a larger manufacturing base  including ontario 
while we are not immune from recessionary and inflationary impacts  historically  we have proven to be fairly resilient in canada during challenging economic times  and we continue to be well positioned  due  in part  to our quality product offerings at reasonable prices 
despite the difficult economic conditions  we continued to grow in by supporting the needs of our customers who were looking for value as a result of economic challenges  without trading off quality 
continuing through  we do expect  overall  to see continued volatility quarter to quarter in the quick service restaurant sector  which may include reductions or increases in customer visits  sales and financial results for our business 
we opened a total of restaurants in fiscal compared to restaurants in fiscal which included self serve kiosks 
our restaurant development program is typically highest in the fourth quarter each year 
we execute our development activities prudently and only with what we believe to be the right opportunities 
in  we continued with the shift we began in  focusing our restaurant development towards smaller restaurants  with a higher mix of non standard units  as well as strategic alliances and co branding opportunities 
operating income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher year over year revenues driven by continued average same store sales gains in canada  growth in the number of systemwide restaurants  resulting in higher royalty  rental and distribution income  and  a rd operating week in fiscal our fiscal year included a rd week of operations as compared to fiscal which had weeks 
the rd week of operations impacted both our revenues and costs by approximately to on a full year basis 
our operating income included million in asset impairment and related restaurant closure costs 
operating income gains in fiscal were also realized from higher contributions from our us operations 
partially offsetting these operating gains were higher general and administrative expenses and lower equity income 
general and administrative expenses included million in professional advisory fees and shareholder related transaction costs associated with our public company reorganization 
in fiscal  our net income increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in net income was primarily a result of the higher operating income and lower net interest expense  partially offset by higher income tax expense 
our net income growth rate of was lower than operating income growth of  due primarily to a non cash valuation allowance on deferred tax assets incurred as part of the public company reorganization of million 
earnings per share increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition to the operating income gains noted above  the decline in the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal  as a result of our share repurchase program  was another driver of higher earnings per share in we recently announced our intention to commence a share repurchase program during  extending through march   in an amount not to exceed million or of outstanding shares as of february  selected operating and financial highlights fiscal years systemwide sales growth average same store sales growth canada us systemwide restaurants revenues in millions operating income in millions net income attributable to thi in millions basic and diluted earnings per share weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding diluted in millions included a rd week of operations

total systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from our republic of ireland and united kingdom licensed locations as these locations operate on a significantly different business model compared to our north american operations 
average same store sales growth average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide ie  includes both franchised and company operated restaurants throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our average same store sales growth is attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service and other operational efficiencies  more frequent customer visits  expansion into broader menu offerings  and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee and other commodities  labour  supplies  utility and other items 
in fiscal  canadian average same store sales increased over fiscal  which was our th consecutive annual increase in canada 
in the us  average same store sales measured in us currency increased in fiscal over fiscal  which represented our th consecutive annual increase 
we continue to see sales momentum into the first quarter of  in both canada and the us transaction growth and a slight increase in average cheque helped to overcome generally challenging macro economic conditions  including higher unemployment that continued to persist for much of our co branding initiative with cold stone creamery was a significant contributor to our us same store sales increase 
in addition  price increases taken in the later half of contributed to the canadian same store sales result  but were partially offset by product mix and promotional items 
pricing was less of a factor in the us in  with the only impact being residual price increases taken in early restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as labour  coffee and other supplies  and utility costs 
we typically expect price increases in one or more markets in both canada and the us throughout a given year  however  there can be no assurance that price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customers maintaining the frequency of their visits even with the new pricing and which also can be affected by promotional activities 
product innovation is one of our focused strategies to drive same store sales growth  including innovation at breakfast as well as other dayparts 
marketing and promotional activities which are designed to drive same store sales growth  contributed to our same store sales results in both canada and the us in fiscal  we had an active menu and product focused promotional program designed to reinforce value to our customers 
in  we began introducing targeted combo food programs at a variety of value price points in response to the challenging economic environment  and we continued these programs in we believe these programs reinforce our value proposition with consumers and position us well to build transactions 
with respect to operational initiatives  our recent strategies are to increase sales include improving speed of service  particularly in our drive thrus  as well as to enhance our customer s overall dining experience inside our restaurants 
our product offerings  promotional activity  and operational efficiencies led to traffic growth in  and we were able to maintain average cheque  which was up slightly 
the following tables set forth average same store sales increases by quarter for fiscal   and and by year for the ten year period from to our historical average same store sales trends are not necessarily indicative of future results 
historical average same store sales increase st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year canada us canada us year average indicates fiscal years that had weeks  for calculation of same store sales increase the comparative base also includes weeks 
new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth 
below is a summary of restaurant openings and closures for our   and fiscal years fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year standard and non standard self serve kiosks total standard and non standard self serve kiosks total standard and non standard self serve kiosks total canada restaurants opened restaurants closed net change us restaurants opened restaurants closed net change total company restaurants opened restaurants closed net change from the beginning of to the end of fiscal  we opened system restaurants including both franchised and company operated restaurants  net of restaurant closures 
typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which are in canada 
restaurant closures generally result from an opportunity to acquire a better location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru 
restaurant closures made in the normal course typically occur at the end of a lease term or the end of the useful life of the principal asset 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 
in  we closed a total of restaurants  the substantial majority being in canada 
in  we closed a total of restaurants  which included the closure of restaurants in the fourth quarter of in southern new england one additional restaurant was closed by february   for a total of closures in southern new england 
the southern new england closures were outside of the normal course of operations  arising from a strategic profitability review of our us operations 
these closures  therefore  triggered an impairment review  resulting in an impairment charge and closure costs in the fourth quarter of in  we began a strategic initiative in the us to co brand certain stores with cold stone creamery 
as of january   we had co branded locations including of our restaurants co branded with cold stone creamery and four cold stone creamery restaurants co branded with tim hortons 
in canada  we ended the year with co branded locations 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into two separate collaborative arrangements with kahala corp  the parent company of cold stone creamery inc the nature and purpose of the arrangements is to expand both parties co branding initiatives 
we have exclusive development rights in canada  and non exclusive rights within the us  to operate ice cream and frozen confections retail outlets in combination with tim hortons retail outlets 
the following table shows our restaurant count as of the end of fiscal  and and provides a breakdown of our company operated and franchised restaurants 
at january    system restaurants across canada and the us  or  were franchised representing in canada and in the us systemwide restaurant count fiscal year canada company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised us company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised total system company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised over the last few years  we have been actively converting many of our us company operated restaurants to operator agreements  and as of january   we have completed this process 
the effect of these conversions to date has been slightly accretive to operating income 
initially  after conversion  we may provide additional relief to the operator  and we may be required to consolidate these restaurants in accordance with variable interest entity accounting rules for consolidations 
we believe that  in the long term  the franchising strategy generally provides better overall profitability to the company 
the following tables contain information about the operating income loss of our reportable segments fiscal compared to fiscal of revenues of revenues change dollars percentage in thousands  except where noted operating income loss canada us    n m reportable segment operating income noncontrolling interests non owned consolidated restaurants    n m corporate charges consolidated operating income fiscal compared to fiscal of revenues of revenues change dollars percentage in thousands  except where noted operating income loss canada us n m reportable segment operating income noncontrolling interests non owned consolidated restaurants corporate charges consolidated operating income includes million of asset impairment and related closure costs in in connection with the closure of restaurants in southern new england 
corporate charges include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units  the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses  as well as a nominal amount of income from international operations discussed below 
n m the comparison is not meaningful 
fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  and  as a percentage of total revenues  was and  respectively 
included in our segment operating income was an asset impairment and related closure costs of million that were recorded in our us segment 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  segment operating income would have increased million  or 
fiscal includes a rd week of operations whereas fiscal only had weeks of operations 
the rd week increased segment revenues and reportable segment operating income growth rates by approximately and  respectively 
canada our canadian segment operating income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to systemwide sales increases and increased contribution from our distribution business 
canadian same store sales growth was in fiscal  including some pricing contributions 
in fiscal  we opened restaurants in canada and closed  compared to opening restaurants and closing in fiscal in  we will continue our focus on driving same store sales  including through daypart and menu opportunities see item business business overview and objectives 
canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
during  we supported our franchisees through the difficult economic conditions by not passing through certain cost increases to franchisees incurred in our distribution business 
partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were lower franchise fee income  higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business  and  lower equity income year over year 
us in  our us segment had operating income of million  compared to an operating loss of million in  which exceeded our break even operating income target 
the significant improvement in our us segment operating loss was  in part  due to the million asset impairment and related closure costs recorded during the fourth quarter of see below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  our operating loss in the us segment would have been million 
therefore  the results compared to  excluding the impairment and related closure cost impacts  reflect a million improvement from the closure of the underperforming company operated restaurants  and the related asset impairment charge contributed to the improvement in the us segment operating income as they resulted in lower company operated restaurant losses and lower depreciation and rent expense  benefiting operating income by million 
in addition  lower general and administrative expense and contributions from vertical integration also positively impacted operating income 
the us operating segment income improvement also resulted from higher systemwide sales  which benefited distribution and rents and royalties income 
our co branding initiative with cold stone creamery contributed a significant portion of our sales growth  leading to rents and royalties revenues and  in some cases  lower relief provided to franchisees 
our core brand same store sales continued to be positive  excluding the impacts of co branding 
partially offsetting these improvements were additional relief provided to certain franchisees  particularly as we transitioned more company operated restaurants to franchisees or operator agreements  and lower franchise fee income 
we anticipate that our us segment operating income will continue to show volatility  quarter to quarter and year to year  as we expand our new unit growth 
when we enter new markets  average unit sales volumes for our franchisees may be lower than sales levels in our more established markets 
in addition  based on past experience  as we add new restaurants in developing markets  average unit sales growth for existing restaurants may be affected for a period of time until awareness of the brand improves and the market adjusts to the added convenience that new locations provide 
in certain situations  we provide relief of rents and royalties  and in some cases  relief for other operating costs  for a period of time to support these franchisees 
such relief offsets our rent and royalty revenues 
in developing markets  when we transition a restaurant from a company operated restaurant to either a full franchised restaurant or a restaurant governed by an operator agreement  we also generally provide relief to the franchisee for an initial period 
our capital investments in the us currently do not generate desired returns in the short term 
however  we believe the continued investment in our us business in accordance with our revised development strategy  will result in long term benefits 
we continue to explore other complementary strategic development opportunities to grow the business  including our co branding initiative  our expansion into new york city utilizing unique restaurant formats  and the opening of restaurants on two us military bases 
we believe that these adjustments to our us business approach will ultimately allow us to broaden brand awareness and convenience in a capital efficient manner 
we saw the benefits of these initiatives in our us systemwide sales results in these initiatives complement our core strategy of selectively developing full serve  standalone tim hortons locations in our core markets 
in  we will be piloting a new concept restaurant in emerging us markets  designed to significantly differentiate our brand and customer offering as a cafe and baked goods destination 
we have also adapted our marketing and promotional activities to the challenging economic environment and related circumstances 
in  we continued to see a large amount of competitive discounting and  as a result  we have targeted combo food programs at a variety of value price points  with the intent to strengthen and build on our price value position and enhance this message with us consumers 
we are also introducing the use of coupons as a vehicle to attract new customers and introduce them to our brand and new product offerings 
while we do not intend to stray from our core everyday positioning of quality food at reasonable prices  we are working with our franchisees to communicate and interact with customers in a manner that responds to their current situation and the economic environment 
we believe that continued business refinements will help  over time  position our us business to defend aggressive competitive discounting activity  while also creating sales momentum 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  and closed two restaurants in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closing restaurants  in fiscal the self serve openings included that were part of a strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
we typically expect price increases in one or more regions during the course of the year  but there can be no assurance that price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customer response to the new pricing  and levels of discretionary spending  and our promotional activities 
in  we did not implement any price increases given the challenging us economic environment 
historically  we have found sales growth achievement to be more challenging in certain us markets where we are less developed 
additionally  in  we completed our initiative to transition most of our company operated restaurants to franchise or operator agreements 
this shift was part of our longer term strategy of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
at the end of  approximately of our us restaurants were franchised  compared to at the end of our historical experience indicates that franchised restaurants are more successful for the franchisee  and therefore us  over the long term 
while transitioning company restaurants to franchise or operator agreements usually results in an initial increase in franchisee relief  particularly in our newer markets  and may increase the number of restaurants that we are required to consolidate in accordance with asc formerly fin r  this increase in relief is typically less than the operating loss we would otherwise incur from operating the restaurants corporately 
as a result  for  there was a net slightly positive benefit to our us segment as a result of the completion of this initiative 
we are typically able to identify franchisees for new restaurants  but in certain developing markets  it may be more challenging  however  it has not historically been a major impediment to our growth 
despite the current economic climate and credit conditions  our franchisees continue to have access to lending programs with third party lenders  although processing may take longer and costs may be higher  consistent with prevailing market conditions 
we are experiencing a higher number of past due notes under our franchise incentive program 
in many cases  we have also chosen to hold the note for longer periods of time than we have historically done to ensure the restaurant has achieved certain profitability targets 
in the event a franchisee cannot repay the note  we will take back ownership of the restaurant and equipment  which effectively collateralizes the note and  therefore  minimizes our risk 
initially  we are also entering into operator agreements more frequently than full franchise agreements  and once the restaurant is established and reaches certain profitability measures  we may convert it to a full franchise agreement 
noncontrolling interests non owned consolidated restaurants our noncontrolling interests income before income tax pertains to non owned restaurants that we consolidate under asc in  our noncontrolling interests income before income tax was million  representing on average restaurants as compared to million in representing on average restaurants 
over the past year  we have had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of us non owned consolidated restaurants as a result of the progression of us restaurants to an owner operator model  versus company operated restaurants 
these us locations have historically had lower revenues and income than canadian non owned consolidated restaurants  which has resulted in substantially lower consolidated income  despite the increase in number of non owned consolidated restaurants 
corporate charges corporate charges include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase primarily reflects the professional advisory and shareholder costs associated with our public company reorganization  which amounted to million 
included in corporate charges was a management restructuring charge  net of savings  of million 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  has self serve kiosks in certain licensed locations within convenience stores in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
the self serve kiosks feature our premium coffee  tea  specialty hot beverages and a selection of donuts and muffins 
as of january   there were self serve kiosks in licensed locations in the republic of ireland and in the united kingdom  primarily operating under the tim hortons brand 
these kiosks are operated by independent licensed retailers 
at present  the distribution of coffee and donuts through licensed locations with respect to these self serve kiosks is not a material contributor to our net income  and therefore  is netted in corporate charges 
these arrangements have resulted in incremental distribution sales and royalties 
our financial arrangements for these self serve kiosks are different than our traditional franchise models  and we may not  therefore  collect similar data or include these locations in certain of our metrics  including systemwide and same store sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  and  as a percentage of total revenues  was and  respectively 
included in our segment operating income was million of asset impairment and related closure costs that were recorded in our us segment 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  segment operating income would have increased million  or  to million 
in addition  operating income as a percentage of total revenues would have been with underlying growth coming entirely from the canadian segment 
canada our canadian segment operating income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal canadian segment operating income and margins benefited from an increase in systemwide sales  which includes sales from new restaurants  net of closures  and same store sales growth 
canadian same store sales growth was in fiscal  of which pricing accounted for a significant portion of this increase 
in fiscal  we opened restaurants in canada and closed  compared to opening restaurants and closing in fiscal canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to a full year of frozen and refrigerated product distribution from our guelph facility rollout completed in third quarter in addition to operational efficiencies realized at this facility during partially offsetting this growth was higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business  and lower equity income year over year primarily because fiscal included a discrete non cash tax benefit that was recognized by our bakery joint venture 
the guelph distribution facility commenced operations in the first quarter of in april  we started the transition to three channel delivery from this distribution centre 
three channel delivery has shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen product on the same truck 
this facility services approximately of our ontario restaurants for shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen products 
during the phase in period for refrigerated and frozen distribution in and the first half of  we faced higher distribution costs without the full benefit of the new distribution revenues 
sales margins on frozen and refrigerated products are typically lower than for some of our other products but have contributed positively to our net income in fiscal and fiscal us in  our us segment had an operating loss of million  compared to an operating loss of million in the significant increase in our us segment operating loss was primarily due to the million asset impairment and related closure costs recorded during the fourth quarter of see below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  our operating loss in the us segment would have been million  an increase of million over the loss 
higher relief provided to certain franchisees  particularly as we transitioned more company operated restaurants to franchisees or operator agreements  contributed to a higher operating loss 
partially offsetting these factors were improved rents and royalties revenues and distribution and manufacturing income derived from overall systemwide sales growth and lower losses from company operated restaurants as a result of the transition of company operated restaurants to franchisee or operator agreements 
in the fourth quarter of  we began a strategic review of the us operations  including a profitability review 
as part of this review  we made the decision to close restaurants in two southern new england markets  of which were closed in december and one was closed by february  these closures resulted in restaurant closure costs of million  primarily consisting of lease termination costs and asset impairment costs 
the closure of these restaurants also triggered an impairment review relating to the two affected markets  which resulted in an impairment charge of million related to the remaining assets in these markets 
these costs  totaling million  were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations under asset impairment and related closure costs 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closing restaurants in fiscal our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  of which were part of a strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  which were part of a strategic alliance with an operator of a national gasoline retailer in the us we ended the year with restaurants  a milestone that we believe indicates that we have achieved a critical mass of restaurants in the us sufficient to position us toward improved profitability of the us segment 
pricing did not fully translate into sales growth for our us segment in as same store sales increased  while pricing represented approximately of this growth  the net impact of which was essentially flat sales growth for despite the pricing increases for the year 
additionally  in  we continued to focus on developing our franchise base by transitioning a number of our company operated restaurants to franchise or operator agreements 
this shift was part of our longer term strategy  which we have now substantially achieved  of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
at the end of  approximately of our us restaurants were franchised compared to at the end of noncontrolling interests non owned consolidated restaurants our noncontrolling interests income before income tax pertains to non owned restaurants that we consolidate under asc in  our noncontrolling interests income before income tax was million  representing on average restaurants as compared to million in representing on average restaurants 
corporate charges corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million decrease reflects the costs associated with the franchisee convention which did not recur in  and we had certain foreign exchange gains in versus foreign exchange losses in the comparable period of in addition  we had lower printing and mailing costs in due to our adoption of the sec s new notice and access model available to us companies for the provision of proxy materials to shareholders through posting at a dedicated website where shareholders can view the information and vote on line  as opposed to required printing and mailing of all materials to all of our shareholders 
partially offsetting these lower costs was a restructuring charge  net of savings  of million incurred in and higher professional fees associated with a review of the corporate structure of the company 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  has launched self serve kiosks in certain licensed locations within convenience stores in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
the self serve kiosks  which feature our premium coffee  tea  specialty hot beverages and a selection of donuts and muffins  were tested and introduced in the first half of as of december   there were self serve kiosks in licensed locations in the republic of ireland  and in the united kingdom  primarily operating under the tim hortons brand 
these kiosks are operated by independent licensed retailers

franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and non owned restaurants on average in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to asc franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income

sales during fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million  or  year over year 
sales growth was driven primarily by higher distribution sales  but was partially offset by lower company operated restaurant sales and lower sales from consolidated non owned restaurants

systemwide sales growth  which reflects higher same store sales and sales from a higher number of restaurants  represented approximately million of total distribution sales growth 
product mix and pricing related primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities due to higher underlying costs also contributed to the sales increase 
we did not pass on all of these cost increases during fiscal  in order to help support our franchisees businesses and our customers during the challenging economic times of distribution sales growth was also favourably impacted by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations  and foreign exchange also contributed positively to the growth 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal our revenue mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution sales  due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain  with some offset by lower sales from company operated restaurants and non owned consolidated restaurants 
as a result  sales as a percentage of total revenues was relatively consistent year over year at in and in our distribution revenues are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 
underlying product costs can also be impacted by currency changes 
increases and decreases in product costs may be passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business  although  as noted above  in fiscal  we did not pass on all cost increases to our franchisees 
these changes may also impact margin percentages as many of our products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up and this can  therefore  create volatility year over year 
company operated restaurants sales 
lower sales were mainly due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in while there was an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week in  the impact on company operated restaurant sales was not significant 
in  we operated  on average  company operated restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in  resulting in a million reduction in company operated restaurant sales year over year 
our company operated restaurant count has been decreasing year over year as we focused on transitioning many of our company operated restaurants  particularly in the us  to either franchise or operator agreements 
in addition  we closed company operated restaurants in our southern new england markets  ten in the fourth quarter of and one early in the first quarter of we ended with company operated restaurants in canada  and in the us  representing approximately and of total restaurants  respectively 
on occasion  we may tend to open company operated restaurants when we enter new markets in the us  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the timing of these events throughout the year and also the type of restaurant standard or non standard that we own 
non owned consolidated restaurants sales 
the majority of non owned restaurants that are consolidated operate either solely under an operator agreement or are franchised locations participating in our us franchise incentive program 
on average  we consolidated and non owned restaurants during and  respectively 
while the overall number of non owned consolidated restaurants has increased  we have had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of us non owned restaurants being consolidated as a result of the progression of us restaurants to the owner operator model from company operated restaurants noted above 
these us locations have historically had lower sales and income than canadian non owned restaurants that were previously consolidated 
partially offsetting the negative impact from the change in restaurant mix of consolidated restaurants was a favourable impact of approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations 
as a result  non owned consolidated restaurant sales declined million year over year 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over  which was fairly consistent with the fiscal systemwide sales growth of  unadjusted for currency 
systemwide sales growth was driven by higher same store sales and sales from new restaurants opened during the year  both of which result in higher royalty and rental revenues because both are typically based  in whole or part  on a percentage of restaurant sales 
rents and royalty growth was driven by overall systemwide sales growth  partially offset by additional relief provided to certain franchisees in us markets 
in addition  the transition of company operated restaurants to either franchises or operator agreements contributed to the growth in rents and royalties revenues 
these factors helped rents and royalty revenue growth to outpace systemwide sales growth year over year 
higher relief in  which was all in our us operations  was primarily related to either restaurants that were open for less than twenty four months or restaurants that were previously operated as company restaurants and transitioned to the owner operator model 
during  both canada and the us excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation contributed to our growth in rents and royalties revenues  net of franchisee relief  largely in proportion to their overall share of systemwide sales 
continued same store sales growth provided million to our rents and royalties growth  while the addition of new full serve restaurants in the system year over year contributed approximately million 
rents and royalties growth was positively impacted by approximately due to an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange contributed to the growth rates in franchise fees 
franchise fees include the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees to cover costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
in the us  we have a franchise incentive program fip whereby revenue and related costs from the sale of initial equipment packages are deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognized on these franchise sales see the application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
franchise fees were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in franchise fees year over year is primarily the result of fewer units sold and a change in restaurant mix to greater non standard locations 
our non standard restaurants utilize a number of unique restaurant formats and resulted in lower franchise fees per unit than our typical non standard format 
partially offsetting this decline in revenue were higher revenues recognized under our fip in the us in  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  compared to standard and non standard restaurants openings in non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities and office buildings 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in compared to self serve kiosks in while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
additionally  lower revenues from resales and replacements were due primarily to a lower number of resales and replacments in a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
in addition  we may enter into operator agreements for new restaurant sales  as opposed to full franchise agreements 
the amount of franchise fee revenues and associated costs are significantly different for operator agreement arrangements as compared to full franchise sales 
franchise revenues from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for purposes of reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported rents and royalties by approximately in compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during franchise fee revenues are not earned evenly throughout the year  and for the us business  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria under the fip program  mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee revenues for fiscal were higher than the value that would have been reported had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or 
cost of sales growth was driven by higher distribution cost of sales  but was partially offset by lower company operated restaurant cost of sales and lower cost of sales from certain consolidated non owned restaurants 
the extra week of operations  due to the inclusion of a rd week in fiscal  increased cost of sales by approximately 
distribution cost of sales 
cost of sales from our distribution business was million  or higher year over year 
higher costs were primarily associated with new products being managed through our supply chain  and continued systemwide sales growth along with changes in product mix and higher underlying product costs  the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange fluctuations 
costs associated with sales of new products represented approximately million  while systemwide sales growth increased costs by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth and the higher number of system restaurants year over year 
in addition  changes in product mix and higher product costs represented million of the increase 
distribution cost of sales was higher by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange accounted for the remainder of cost of sales growth increase 
the rate of growth in distribution cost of sales in fiscal was higher than the corresponding rate of growth in distribution sales in fiscal due primarily to higher product costs  including increases in underlying commodity costs such as coffee and sugar and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  most of which but not all were passed on to franchisees 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal our cost of sales mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution cost of sales due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain and the cost increases noted above some of which were not fully passed on to franchisees  but is somewhat offset by lower cost of sales from company operated restaurants and non owned consolidated restaurants  cost of sales as a percentage of total costs and expenses was in and in our distribution costs are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 
underlying product costs can also be impacted by currency changes  as was the case this year 
increases and decreases in product costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business  although  as noted above  in fiscal  we did not pass on all cost increases 
these changes may also impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up and can create volatility year over year 
see commodity risks below 
company operated restaurants cost of sales 
cost of sales associated with company operated restaurants includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  and varies with the average number and mix eg  size  location  and standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
non owned consolidated restaurants cost of sales 
cost of sales declined million year over year due to the change in mix of restaurants to include a greater proportion of us restaurants  partially offset by approximately of higher costs of sales due to the inclusion of a rd week 
over the past year  we have had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of certain us non owned restaurants requiring consolidation  which historically have lower costs per restaurant than certain canadian non owned restaurants 
on average  we consolidated and non owned restaurants under asc during fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported costs of sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  representing an increase of 
operating expenses growth was driven by higher rent expense  primarily as a result of additional properties that were leased and then subleased to franchisees and higher percentage rent on certain properties resulting from increased restaurant sales 
depreciation expense was also higher as the total number of properties we either own or lease and then subleased to franchisees increased to  in from  in in addition  operating expenses were higher by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week 
foreign exchange translation also increased operating expenses see below 
we also had higher project and related support costs  such as salaries  property maintenance  and higher other expenses 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported operating expenses by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise fee costs franchise fee costs include costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
franchise fee costs declined million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal costs declined primarily due to a fewer number of standard restaurant openings  fewer resales and replacements and a higher number of restaurants opened as operator agreements versus full franchise agreements  which results in lower costs and associated revenues 
partially offsetting these lower costs were a higher number of us franchise sales recognized under the fip resulting in recognition of the associated costs  and  higher support costs  generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
franchise fee costs are not incurred evenly throughout the year and  for the us  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee costs for fiscal were higher than the value that would have been reported had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these costs were recognized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
in general  our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal included million related to professional advisory fees  shareholder related transaction costs  and filing fees associated with our reorganization as a canadian public company 
in addition  higher salary and benefit expenses and foreign exchange resulting from the translation of our general and administrative expenses from us operations see below also increased expenses in fiscal the additional week of operations in fiscal contributed approximately of the increase 
partially offsetting these higher expenses was the million management restructuring charge  net of savings  related to changes in senior management that occurred in that did not recur in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased marginally from in to in there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing of recurring expenses or certain other events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
our us segment general and administrative expense is denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported general and administrative expenses by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence 
our two most significant equity investments are our joint venture with iaws group plc now owned by arytza ag arytza  which provides our system with par baked donuts  timbits  some bread products and  most recently  pastries  and our timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants 
in fiscal  equity income was million compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million 
year over year  lower equity income relates primarily to commodity cost pressures  generally from the first half of  at our bakery joint venture  which more than offset the slightly higher earnings from our timwen partnership during fiscal equity income benefitted from a favourable impact of approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations 
as previously disclosed  we do not expect that our equity income will necessarily grow at the same rate as our systemwide sales as it is not representative of all the components of our business 
for instance  our bakery joint venture provides bakery products which do not necessarily have the same growth rate as total systemwide sales 
in fiscal  we have had some commodity cost increases at our bakery joint venture that were not passed on to our franchisees 
this is one of the ways we are helping to support our franchisees businesses and our customers during these challenging economic times 
this affects the profitability of our bakery joint venture 
as well  our timwen partnership is expected to grow at a slower rate as we are unlikely to add any new properties to this venture in the future 
asset impairment and related closure costs in  asset impairment and related closure costs of million were incurred relating to the decision to close restaurants in two southern new england markets  of which were closed in december and one was closed in early other income  net other income  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
this includes gains and losses on asset sales  other asset write offs  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income  net  was million versus million in fiscal the million increase was primarily the result of a gain on the sale of a property in of million  partially offset by lower foreign exchange gains in interest expense total interest expense  including interest paid on our credit facilities  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower effective interest rates on our term debt  partially offset by higher interest expense due to a higher number of capital leases during fiscal over interest income interest income is comprised of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents as well as imputed interest on our fip notes receivable 
interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower overall rates of return on cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in  and within our revised targeted range of between and  which was adjusted to include the impact of the public company reorganization transaction 
as previously disclosed  the variance between years was primarily due to the tax effects of the completion of the public company merger on september   as approved by stockholders of the company on september   and the subsequent reorganization of the company and its subsidiaries collectively the reorganization 
the discrete items resulting from the reorganization that contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate included a valuation allowance relating to the uncertainty of realizing million of deferred tax assets relating to us operations  us withholding tax expense of million  and other tax charges of million 
these expenses were offset by the reversal of million of previously accrued canadian withholding taxes 
we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately in  although some volatility may be experienced between quarters 
the expected effective tax rate does not include the impact of new tax matters such as unanticipated audit issues by taxation authorities or changes in tax law  rates or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination of income tax expense takes into consideration amounts that may be needed to cover exposure for open tax years 
the canada revenue agency is currently conducting an examination of various canadian subsidiaries of the company for and subsequent taxation years 
the audit was completed for canada during and resulted in no material change in income taxes 
the internal revenue service completed in a previous year its examination of the wendy s consolidated tax group which included tim hortons inc up to september  in addition  income tax returns filed with various provincial and state jurisdictions are generally open to examination for periods of three to five years subsequent to the filing of the respective return 
we do not currently expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years  however  actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued 
we are party to a tax sharing agreement with wendy s  as subsequently amended on november  the agreement  which sets forth the principles and responsibilities of wendy s and the company regarding the allocation of taxes  audits and other tax matters relating to periods when we were part of the same us federal consolidated or state and local combined tax filing group 
the agreement is applicable for all taxation periods up to september  commencing september   we became a standalone public company and  as a result  we file all us tax returns independently from wendy s from that date forward 
either we or wendy s may be required to reimburse the other party for the use of tax attributes while we filed us consolidated or state and local combined returns  as a result of audits or similar proceedings giving rise to adjustments to previously filed returns  in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as several years remain open to review and adjustment by taxation authorities  payments may be made by one party to the other for the use of the other party s tax attributes 
no payments have been made by either party to the other under this agreement during fiscal net income attributable to noncontrolling interests effective for the first quarter of  we adopted provisions within asc formerly sfas no 

the adoption of this standard required retroactive application see basis of presentation application of critical accounting policies 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests relates to the minority interests arising from certain non owned restaurants we consolidate in accordance with asc formerly fin r 
in fiscal  we consolidated on average restaurants under asc formerly fin r as compared to restaurants during fiscal over the past year  we have had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of us non owned restaurants  which historically have had lower income than canadian non owned restaurants consolidated under asc formerly fin r and  consequently  we have had lower net income attributable to these interests 
comprehensive income in fiscal  comprehensive income attributable to tim hortons inc was million compared to million in fiscal net income increased million in fiscal from fiscal  as discussed above 
other comprehensive income included a translation adjustment loss of million in fiscal as opposed to a translation adjustment gain of million in fiscal translation adjustment losses and gains arise primarily from the translation of our us net assets into our reporting currency  canadian dollars  at the period end rates 
the remainder of the year over year change in other comprehensive income is attributable to a loss of million related to cash flow hedges  net of taxes in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal the exchange rates were cdn  cdn  and cdn for us on january   december   and december   respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for fiscal and financial definitions can be found immediately following liquidity and capital resources

rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and non owned restaurants on average in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to asc franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income 
the reported franchise restaurant sales were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues sales in fiscal  sales were  million  representing an increase of million  or  over fiscal our sales include distribution sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from certain non owned restaurants 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  driven in part by million in incremental sales from the rollout of frozen and refrigerated products from our guelph distribution centre 
the rollout was completed in the third quarter of and  therefore  primarily influenced distribution sales growth during the first half of another significant contribution to distribution sales growth during fiscal was underlying product demand associated with systemwide sales growth  which reflects sales from a higher number of restaurants and higher same store sales 
systemwide sales growth  excluding pricing impacts  represented approximately million of total distribution sales growth 
in addition  higher distribution sales and corresponding costs see below were also driven by new products managed through our supply chain  representing approximately million of the increase 
partially offsetting these growth factors were some sales related to specific programs  such as the uniform rollout  that did not recur in the remainder of distribution sales growth is attributable to a combination of changes in product mix and pricing 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal this change in revenues mix has an impact on overall margins since margins on some frozen and refrigerated products are lower than other products we distribute  but contribute positively to our operating income 
company operated restaurants sales 
company operated restaurant sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in in  we operated  on average  company operated restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in on occasion  we may open more company operated restaurants when we enter new markets  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the type of restaurant standard or non standard and the timing of these events throughout the year 
in addition  we closed company operated restaurants in the fourth quarter of in our southern new england markets and recorded restaurant closure costs and an impairment charge related to these markets see below 
during fiscal  we have transitioned many of our us company operated restaurants to either franchise or operator agreements 
while this may have the effect of lowering our sales from company operated restaurants  many of these restaurants meet the criteria set out in asc  thus requiring us to consolidate most of these restaurants under these rules and  therefore  consolidate their sales 
as a result  we have increased the number of restaurants consolidated under asc see below 
in addition  restaurants operating under operator agreements often qualify for increased financial support  primarily in the area of rent and royalties relief see franchise revenues below 
non owned consolidated restaurants sales 
the consolidation of and certain non owned restaurants  on average  during fiscal and resulted in an increase in sales of million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported sales for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over which was fairly consistent with the fiscal systemwide sales growth of 
as new restaurants open and average same store sales at existing restaurants increase  both our royalty and rental revenues increase because these are typically both based  in whole or part  on a percentage of sales 
the canadian segment contributed substantially all of this growth with million of overall growth related to positive same store sales growth and million related to the net addition of new restaurants in the system year over year 
the us segment experienced rents and royalties growth in excess of us systemwide sales growth due to a shift from company operated restaurants to operator agreements 
higher growth in the us was reduced to a large extent by higher relief provided to certain of our us franchisees  due in part from the shift towards operator agreements as well as a result of the challenging economic times many of our franchisees faced in franchise fees 
franchise fees include the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees to cover costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
in the us  we have a franchise incentive program whereby revenue and related costs from the sale of initial equipment packages is deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognized on these franchise sales see the application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
franchise fees of million during fiscal were essentially unchanged from fiscal in  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  compared to standard and non standard restaurants openings in non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities and office buildings and typically have lower initial franchise fees 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in compared to self serve kiosks in while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
additionally  although the franchise fees reflect a higher number of restaurant openings in  they were offset by lower revenues from resales and replacements 
a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
we also had lower franchise fee revenues in the us in as a result of the revenue recognition criteria for our franchise incentive program  referenced above 
franchise revenues from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported rents and royalties for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise fee revenues are not earned evenly throughout the year  and for the us business  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee revenues for fiscal would have been lower had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal our cost of sales includes distribution cost of sales  cost of sales from company operated restaurants  and cost of sales from certain non owned restaurants 
distribution cost of sales 
distribution cost of sales increased million  or  during the year 
of this increase  million was due to the increased cost of product and operating costs from the rollout of frozen and refrigerated distribution from our guelph facility 
product demand from systemwide sales growth represented approximately million due to an increase in the number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
in addition  cost of sales increased million due to new products being managed through our supply chain 
partially offsetting this growth were certain items included in distribution cost of sales in that did not recur in  such as the uniform rollout 
the remainder of cost of sales growth was the result of a combination of product mix and cost increases 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal our distribution business will continue to be subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee and sugar 
these cost changes can impact distribution revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
see commodity risks below 
company operated restaurants cost of sales 
company operated restaurant cost of sales  which includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  varies with the average number and mix eg  size  location  standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
non owned consolidated restaurants cost of sales 
the consolidation of and certain non owned restaurants  on average  during fiscal and  respectively  resulted in cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
associated cost of certain non owned restaurants were impacted by restaurant mix eg size  location  standard or non standard and foreign exchange rates 
cost of sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported cost of sales for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to the increased number of restaurant openings and higher variable rent on existing properties due to sales growth  primarily in the canadian business 
rent expense and other property costs  as well as support costs  increased in fiscal as a result of additional properties being leased and then subleased to franchisees since december  rent expense also increased due to higher percentage rent costs on certain properties where we pay percentage rent  resulting from increased restaurant sales 
in addition  depreciation expense was higher as the total number of properties owned or leased by us in canada and the us  and then subleased to franchisees  increased by properties to  compared to  such properties in fiscal operating expenses will also increase as a result of higher depreciation expense from a higher number of system restaurants 
systemwide sales increases will also increase future operating expenses due to higher rent on variable rate leases and other factors 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported operating expenses for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise fee costs franchise fee costs include costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
franchise fee costs of million were essentially flat from fiscal  consistent with the change in franchise fee revenues noted above 
higher standard and non standard franchise sales were offset in part by a lower number of resales and replacements as well as fewer franchise sales recognized in the us due to the recognition criteria mentioned earlier 
while overall restaurant openings were significantly higher than fiscal  much of this growth was primarily from self serve kiosks which typically have lower franchise fee costs than traditional standard and non standard locations 
in addition  increased support costs generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants  increased year over year franchise fee costs 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
franchise fee costs are not incurred evenly throughout the year and for the us and depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee costs for fiscal would have been lower had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased marginally from in to in our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed revenue growth revenue growth was in fiscal 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing of recurring expenses or certain other events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher expense was the result of increased salaries and benefit expenses due to additional employees required to support the growth of the business  a restructuring charge  net of savings  of million see below  and higher professional fees associated with a review of the corporate structure of the company  mentioned previously 
partially offsetting these higher expenses were costs associated with the franchisee convention did not recur in on april   we announced changes to our executive management structure to both strengthen and streamline executive oversight of key business operations 
in addition  certain employees left the organization under various retirement and other arrangements 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of in general and administrative expense relating to these retirement and other arrangements 
the restructuring yielded net savings in the second half of of approximately million  for a net reduction in fiscal operating results attributable to these charges of million 
our hrcc changed the long term incentive or equity compensation program in for our named executive officers  as follows i we continued to issue restricted stock units  but they were conditional on the achievement of performance objectives over the prior fiscal year p rsus  and ii we commenced an option program with linked or tandem stock appreciation rights sars 
p rsus and options sars were granted in may stock based compensation costs  which are included in general and administrative expenses  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of the having more grants outstanding for the majority of  vesting on average over a month period  except for the immediate expensing of rsu grants for retirement eligible employees 
our us segment general and administrative expense is denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported general and administrative expenses for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence 
our two most significant equity investments are our joint venture with arytza which provides our system with par baked donuts  timbits  bread products  and most recently  pastries  and our timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants to both tim hortons and wendy s restaurants of canada inc in fiscal  equity income was million  representing a decrease of million from fiscal operating gains at our timwen partnership were essentially offset by lower income at our bakery joint venture primarily as a result of a discrete  non cash tax benefit of million recognized by our bakery joint venture in that did not recur  plus the impact of higher commodity costs  and commissioning costs for a new pastry line that was put into operation during the first quarter of the new pastry line began servicing system restaurants in a phased in approach during the second quarter of asset impairment and related closure costs as part of a strategic review of the us operations  including a profitability review  we made the decision to close restaurants in two southern new england markets  the majority being company operated restaurants  of which were closed in december and one was closed by february  in total  asset impairment and related closure costs of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of of which million related to the restaurant closures and million related to an asset impairment relating to the restaurants that continue to operate in the two affected markets 
other income  net other income  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
this includes gains and losses on asset sales  other asset write offs  foreign exchange gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income  net  was million versus million of other income  net  in fiscal the million net increase in other income was primarily a result of foreign exchange gains in as opposed to foreign exchange losses in primarily related to foreign currency net asset positions 
foreign currencies strengthened substantially in late as opposed to weakening substantially in interest expense total interest expense  including interest on our credit facilities  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily a result of higher interest on additional capital leases  partially offset by lower effective interest rates on our term debt 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower overall rates of return on investments and lower overall non restricted cash balances  which were partially offset by interest earned on restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments relating to our tim card 
interest earned on restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments of million in fiscal was contributed to our advertising and promotion fund 
the contribution is recorded in general and administrative expense 
income taxes the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in the variance is primarily explained by the reduction in canadian federal statutory rates and withholding tax rates in  offset by increases to valuation allowances relating to us deferred tax assets 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests effective for the first quarter of  we adopted provisions within asc formerly sfas no 

the adoption of this standard required retroactive application see basis of presentation application of critical accounting policies 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests relates to the minority interests arising from certain non owned restaurants we consolidate in accordance with asc formerly fin r 
in fiscal  we consolidated on average restaurants under asc formerly fin r as compared to restaurants during fiscal comprehensive income in fiscal  comprehensive income attributable to tim hortons inc was million compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million related to noncontrolling interest  respectively 
net income attributable to tim hortons inc increased million in fiscal from fiscal  as discussed above 
other comprehensive income included a translation adjustment gain of million in fiscal compared to a translation adjustment loss of million in fiscal translation adjustment income loss arises primarily from the translation of our us net assets into our reporting currency  canadian dollars  at the period end rates 
the remainder of the year over year change in other comprehensive income is attributable to a gain of million related to cash flow hedges  net of taxes in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the exchange rate was cdn for us on december  and was cdn for us on december  xbrl filing attached as exhibit to this report are documents formatted in xbrl extensible business reporting language

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has  for the most part  self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions and investments during the last five years 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash given investment plans and stage of growth  and we expect this trend to continue through  but to a lesser extent than in the past 
our canadian and us revolving credit facilities provide additional sources of liquidity  if needed 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal  for a net increase of million see comparative cash flows below 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures and expected debt service requirements over the next twelve months 
if additional funds are needed for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes beyond current availability under our revolving credit facilities  we believe  with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong capital structure  we could borrow additional funds 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our existing credit facilities 
any such borrowings may result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
if such additional borrowings are significant  our capital structure could be weakened  and it is possible that we would not be able to borrow on terms which are favourable to us 
our senior bank facility  which consists of a million term loan and two revolving credit facilities us million and million  matures on february  these facilities are at variable interest rates that are based upon either bankers acceptances or libor plus a margin of bps  or a fixed base rate 
if certain market conditions caused libor to be unascertainable or not reflective of the cost of funding  the administration agent under the facility can cause the borrowing to be at the base rate which is historically higher than libor 
this facility does not carry a market disruption clause and is supported by a syndicate lending group of financial institutions  of which canadian financial institutions hold approximately of the total funding commitment 
we carefully monitor our bank group and currently believe our access to liquidity is substantially unchanged despite current credit market conditions 
as part of our public company reorganization  we amended and restated the senior bank facility  effective september   to include  among other administrative changes  the company and our primary us subsidiary as a borrower  and also added the company as a guarantor 
given that the facility matures in february  we have commenced a review of our refinancing options 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction  renovations of existing restaurants  expansion of our business through vertical integration and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant because of our focused management of accounts receivable and inventory 
in each of the last five fiscal years  operating cash flows have funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
at january   we had approximately million in term debt and capital leases included in long term obligations on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet  including our cash position  provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and our share repurchase program 
given the continued credit concerns in financial markets  when investing our cash  we are more focused on capital preservation than yield 
in fiscal  we continued to repurchase shares under our previously announced share repurchase program  which authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common shares  not to exceed the regulatory maximum of  shares  which was equivalent to of the company s outstanding common shares at the time of regulatory approval on february  the program commenced on march  and was suspended between april and october  until the company completed a review of its capital allocation activities after reorganizing as a canadian public company 
the program resumed in november under the program  shares were repurchased through a combination of a b  or automatic trading program  and through management s discretion  subject to regulatory requirements  market  cost  and other considerations 
in fiscal  we spent approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares under this program 
our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to million  or of our outstanding shares as of february  the program  which received toronto stock exchange approval on march   commenced on march  and will continue for twelve months ending in march  the program may terminate earlier if the million maximum or the of outstanding share limit is reached  or  at the discretion of management or our board of directors  subject to the company s compliance with regulatory requirements 
the company may make repurchases on the new york stock exchange  or the toronto stock exchange and or other canadian marketplaces  subject to regulatory requirements 
timing of the share repurchases will be at management s discretion given prevailing market conditions  cost and other consideration and pursuant to an automatic trading or b plan  at inception 
we expect that all purchases made under the program will be primarily funded from cash from operations and repurchased shares will be cancelled 
since initiation of these share repurchase programs  we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately million shares  or  of our outstanding common shares as of the date of inception of the first program  for a total cost of million 
separately  we spent million to acquire shares from the tdl rsu plan trust in  as previously disclosed 
we have primarily funded all of these repurchases to date from our cash on hand and from our cash from operations 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling approximately million 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling approximately million 
we have historically paid for all dividends primarily from cash generated from our operations  and we expect to continue to do so in in  our targeted dividend payout range was to of prior year normalized net income  which is net income adjusted for certain discrete items  such as tax impacts and asset impairment and related closure costs  that affect our annual net income 
in february  our board of directors approved a change to our long term targeted dividend payout range  reflecting our strong cash flow position  which allows us to continue our number one priority of funding our business growth investment needs while still returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
our long term targeted dividend payout range will change to to of prior year  normalized annual net earnings  focusing initially at the lower end of the range 
coinciding with this change in  our board has declared a quarterly dividend of per share payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march   representing an increase of from the previous dividend rate 
dividends are declared and paid in canadian dollars to all shareholders with canadian resident addresses 
for us resident shareholders  dividends paid will be converted to us dollars based on prevailing exchange rates at time of conversion by the clearing and depository services inc for beneficial shareholders and by us for registered shareholders 
notwithstanding our targeted payout range and the recent increase in our dividend  the declaration and payment of all future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the company s continued financial performance  debt covenant compliance  and other risk factors 
in  we established the tdl rsu plan trust 
the trust holds our common shares for future use to satisfy our obligation to settle restricted stock units rsus granted to certain canadian employees under our stock incentive plan by delivering common shares 
this trust enables us to fix the amount of cash required to satisfy rsu obligations that vest in a future period at approximately the same dollar value at which the rsus were originally granted 
in fiscal and  the trust purchased approximately  shares and  shares  respectively  of our common shares on the open market for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the trust settled rsu obligations with the substantial majority of the company s canadian employees by disbursing million shares from the trust  with a total value of million  after ensuring provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
in fiscal  prior to the corporate reorganization  rsu obligations to us employees and directors were settled with treasury shares 
as a canadian public company after the reorganization  we no longer have treasury shares and as a result  rsu obligations to us employees and certain other participants were settled by open market purchase  all of the foregoing after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
credit facilities we have an unsecured five year senior bank facility senior bank facility with a syndicate of canadian and us financial institutions  which are guaranteed by us and certain of our other subsidiaries and which may be drawn by us or one of our principal subsidiaries 
our senior bank facility consists of the following a million term loan  a million canadian revolving credit facility which includes million overdraft availability and million letter of credit facility  and a us million us revolving credit facility which includes a us million letter of credit facility 
the senior bank facility was amended and restated upon the completion of the public company reorganization in fiscal to include the company and our principal us operating subsidiary as borrowers and to include the company as a guarantor  among other administrative changes 
as of january   the million term debt was outstanding and the revolvers were undrawn  except for approximately million being used to support standby letters of credit with various parties 
the senior bank facility matures on february  the term loan bears interest at a variable rate per annum equal to canadian prime rate or  alternatively  we may elect to borrow by way of bankers acceptances or loans equivalent thereto plus a margin 
the senior bank facility contains various covenants which  among other things  requires the maintenance of two financial ratios a consolidated maximum total debt to earnings before interest expenses  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio  and  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as at january  the consolidated maximum debt coverage ratio is computed as consolidated total debt divided by net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business the denominator 
consolidated total debt the numerator primarily includes all liabilities for borrowed money  capital lease obligations  letters of credit whether or not related to borrowed money  the net marked to market under swap agreements and guarantee liabilities 
the minimum fixed charge coverage is computed as net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  rent expense  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business  collectively as the numerator  divided by consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges includes interest and rent expense 
in connection with the senior bank facility  we entered into million of interest rate swaps in march and june with multiple financial institutions to help manage our exposure to interest rate volatility see item a interest rate risk 
the senior bank facility contains certain covenants that will limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create liens  merge with other entities  sell assets  make restricted payments  make certain investments  loans  advances  guarantees or acquisitions  change the nature of our business  enter into transactions with affiliates  or enter into certain restrictive agreements  or pay dividends or make share repurchases if we are not in compliance with the financial covenants  or if such transactions would cause us to not be in compliance with the financial covenants 
events of default under the senior bank facility include  among other things a default in the payment of the obligations under the senior bank facility  a breach of any representation  warranty or covenant by us or certain of our subsidiaries under the senior bank facility  certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation involving us or certain of our subsidiaries  any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of us or certain of our subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds million  and a change of control 
as noted previously  this facility does not carry a market disruption clause and is supported by a syndicate lending group of financial institutions  of which canadian financial institutions hold approximately of the total funding commitment 
we carefully monitor our bank group and currently believe our access to liquidity is substantially unchanged despite prior and current credit market conditions 
we will use the borrowings under the revolving portions  if drawn  of the senior bank facility for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions and other business initiatives 
comparative cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal driving operating cash flow growth in fiscal was higher deferred taxes of million  a net contribution from changes in working capital of million  higher net income attributable to tim hortons inc of million  and higher depreciation expense of million 
partially offsetting this growth was the add back of the non cash asset impairment and related closure costs  which did not recur in included in deferred tax expense in was approximately million relating to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets relating to us operations in connection with the public company reorganization 
the higher depreciation expense primarily reflects depreciation expense from new restaurant development in late and fiscal and depreciation related to new information technology systems 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
the higher use of cash resulted primarily from restricted investments related to our tim card program and other investing activities 
partially offsetting these items were lower capital expenditures year over year as we focused on more capital efficient designs and locations and targeted strategic restaurants initiatives that did not require as significant amounts of capital as our previous designs and locations 
we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures are typically the largest ongoing component of our investing activities and include expenditures for new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  and other corporate capital needs 
a summary of capital expenditures for fiscal   and is as follows fiscal years in millions capital expenditures new restaurants restaurant replacements and renovations new coffee roasting facility other capital needs total capital expenditures capital expenditures were primarily for new restaurant development and remodeling mentioned above  as well as technology initiatives and other capital needs 
in addition  capital expenditures in fiscal included expenditures related to the completion of our new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario 
expenditures for other capital needs typically represent software implementations  other equipment purchases required for ongoing business needs  and  in  the conversion of our oakville warehouse to office space 
capital expenditures for new restaurants by operating segment were as follows fiscal years in millions canada us total we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be between million and million for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
we anticipate these and future capital needs related to our normal business activities will be funded through ongoing operations 
financing activities 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the primary driver for this decreased spending relates to our reduced spending on our share repurchase program year over year of million as we delayed repurchases during april through october until we completed a review of our capital allocation activities after our public company reorganization 
partially offsetting this lower spending was higher dividend payments in contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of january  are shown in the following table 
purchase obligations primarily include commitments for advertising expenditures and purchases for certain food related ingredients 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt  including interest and current maturities advertising fund restricted debt  including interest and current maturities capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations as of january  in thousands other commercial commitments franchisee lease and loan guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds total other commercial commitments future interest payments on term debt have been calculated at the year end quarterly interest rate plus the spread  as set on december  the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million including related interest as the company is unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate when possible cash settlements with a taxing authority would occur refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
we purchase certain products in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
included in the purchase obligations outlined above are commitments relating to the following commodities green coffee  sugar  palm soybean oil and wheat 
some of these purchase commitments are made on behalf of third party suppliers and one of our joint venture partners 
we generally purchase six to twelve months forward in these commodities 
we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including setting fixed prices with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
in general  we do not have contracts with our suppliers of commodities that extend greater than twelve months 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we have guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of franchisees amounting to million 
in the event of default by a franchisee  we generally retain the right to acquire possession of the related restaurants 
we are also the guarantor on million in letters of credit and surety bonds with various parties  however  we do not expect any significant loss to result from these instruments because we do not believe performance will be required 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and december  as that term is described by the sec

the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies  including our critical accounting policies  in note of our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates and judgments are inherent in  but not limited to  the following the estimation of the collectibility of royalty and other franchise related revenue  legal obligations  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of and intangibles and other long lived assets  inventory valuation  gift certificate and cash card breakage  property and equipment  including the estimation of the useful lives of property and equipment and other long lived assets  and  valuations associated with estimating stock based compensation expense 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results could vary from these assumptions or had different assumptions been used 
the company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which also requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
we may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required

we have adopted this new accounting standard in this form k by providing references to the codification topics alongside references to the pre codification standards 
described below are critical accounting policies  which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition the timing of revenue recognition for sales  and franchise revenues rents and royalties and franchise fees  does not involve significant estimates and assumptions sales the timing of revenue recognition for sales distribution and company operating restaurants  and franchise revenues rents and royalties and franchise fees does not involve significant estimates and assumptions 
we operate warehouses in canada to distribute coffee and other dry goods and refrigerated and frozen products to an extensive franchise system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the franchisee  or in certain cases  where the product is delivered to a third party distributor 
revenue at company operated restaurants is recognized upon tender of payment at the time of sale 
franchise revenues our restaurants are predominantly franchised 
we grant franchise licenses or operator agreements to independent operators who in turn pay franchise fees and other payments  which may include payments for equipment  royalties and  in most cases  rents for each restaurant opened 
franchise fees are collected at the time of sale or resale or renovation of the franchised restaurant 
franchise fees and equipment sales are generally recognized as income when each restaurant commences operations and payment is received from the franchisee  unless the franchisee is participating in our franchise incentive program fip see below 
rental revenue  excluding contingent rent  is recognized on a straight line basis 
contingent rent is recognized in the month earned 
royalties  based on a percent of monthly sales  are recognized as income on the accrual basis 
we have developed a fip for some of our us franchisees  which provides financing for both the initial franchise fee and the purchase of certain restaurant equipment  furniture  trade fixtures  and interior signs 
the payment for those assets is deferred for a period of weeks from the date of opening 
the initial franchise fee revenue is recognized at the time of sale and the equipment revenue is recognized after a sustained period of sales levels are achieved  or weeks  whichever is earlier 
in  the fip was modified by shortening the payment period from weeks to weeks 
in addition  the franchisee has the option to pay for the initial franchise fee  including interest thereon  on a weekly basis over a period of up to weeks from the opening of the restaurant 
we generally control  either through ownership or by leasing  a significant majority of the real estate on which the company s restaurants are located  and we lease the real estate to our franchisees 
rental income is recorded on an accrual basis 
most leases provide for fixed payments with contingent or percentage rent after sales exceed certain levels  while others provide for monthly rentals based solely on a percentage of sales 
fixed  or base  rental revenue is recorded on a straight line basis and contingent or percentage based rental revenue is recognized when sales exceed certain levels 
franchisees may receive other financial assistance  or relief  such as lower rents and royalties and reductions or assistance with certain other operating cost relief for restaurants in new and developing markets  and the amount of this relief is recorded as an offset to our rents and royalties revenues 
we provide for estimated losses for receivables that are not likely to be collected 
although we generally enjoy a positive relationship with our franchisees  and collection rates have historically been high  if average sales or the financial health of our franchisees were to deteriorate  we might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes formerly sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for accounting purposes as compared to tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized  except for the amount of earnings related to our foreign operations where repatriation is not contemplated in the foreseeable future 
income taxes reported in the consolidated statements of operations include the current and deferred portions of the expense 
income taxes applicable to items charged or credited to equity are netted with such items 
changes in deferred income taxes related to a change in tax rates are recognized in the period when the tax rate change is enacted 
in addition  the consolidated statements of operations contain items that are non taxable or non deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  cause the income tax provision to be different from what it would be if based on statutory rates 
when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflect the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
effective january   we adopted asc  which provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in accordance with asc  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest  and penalties and reducing the january  balance of retained earnings 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 
property and equipment we carry our property and equipment at cost 
depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives depreciation periods buildings and leasehold improvements to years or lease term restaurant and other equipment to years capital leases to years or lease term computer hardware and software to years advertising fund property and equipment to years other to years construction in progress reclassified to above categories when put in use we estimate useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
lease term as defined in asc formerly sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended 
interest and other costs associated with the construction of new restaurants are capitalized 
major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are classified in other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are grouped into operating markets  which represent the lowest level of independent cash flows and tested for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicate impairment may exist triggering event  which may include a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of prior to its estimated useful life 
events such as prolonged negative same store sales growth in the market  which is a key operating metric  or prolonged negative cash flows in the operating market  are indicators that we use in evaluating whether an impairment may exist 
we also test for impairment if we have a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in any one market 
in developed markets  one of our key indicators for the overall health of an operating market is same store sales growth 
we also consider the length of time we have been in the market as it takes time to fully establish a market 
generally  if same store sales decline over time on a consecutive basis  further evaluation may be required  including review of operating market cash flows 
in developing markets  we assess a number of factors  including systemwide sales growth  which encompasses new restaurants and same store sales growth  the stage of growth of the operating market and the average unit sales volume trends  as well as a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in a market 
given the current market conditions present for the majority of the period under review  we also make assessments as to whether declines are an indication of expected long term performance for the developing market 
non restaurant related assets are grouped based on their ability to generate independent cash flows 
in the case of our manufacturing facilities  they are grouped on a facility by facility basis 
corporate assets  which relate primarily to land  buildings  and computer hardware and software systems  are grouped on a consolidated level with all long lived assets as they support the entire business and independent cash flows are not generated from these specific assets 
if it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is completed on the affected market to determine if the future expected cash flows of a market are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
if it is determined that the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient  then the market is deemed to be impaired 
the fair value of the property and equipment is estimated using primarily third party appraisals or the discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
the estimated fair value is allocated to individual assets within the group 
gift certificates and cash cards we have a tim card a quick pay cash card program 
generally  customers can prepay for future purchases at participating tim hortons restaurants or over the internet by reloading a dollar value onto their tim card through cash or credit cards when  and as needed 
a tim card entitles the holder to use the value for purchasing product only and the amounts generally are nonrefundable and not redeemable for cash 
tim card holders are not entitled to any interest  dividends or returns on prepaid amounts 
there are no expiration dates on the cash cards  and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrease to customer balances 
cash collected from the loading of the tim card are recorded as restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheet since these funds have been designated for use only by the cash card program to honour outstanding obligations 
changes in the restricted cash and cash equivalents balances have been classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows while changes in the restricted investments are classified as an investing activity 
the restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investment balances at january  and december   represent the prepaid amounts not yet redeemed by customers 
the outstanding customer obligations for both tim cards and gift certificates are recorded in accrued liabilities  other on the consolidated balance sheet 
since the inception of the program  interest on the restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments has been contributed to our advertising and promotion funds to help offset costs associated with this program 
while we will honour all cash cards presented for payment  we may  based on historical review after the program has been in place for some time  determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other factors  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  the obligation for any such card balances may be transferred to our advertising and promotion funds 
no such amounts were recognized in  or in addition to the tim card program  we have gift certificates available in certain locations for a limited time 
the company will continue to honour outstanding gift certificates 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or a tim card to purchase product at a company operated restaurant  we recognize the revenue from the sale of the product 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or tim card at a franchised restaurant  we recognize revenues  in the form of rents and royalties  arising from the sale of the product 
we recognize income on unredeemed gift certificates gift certificate breakage when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificate value to relevant jurisdictions 
we determine gift certificate breakage based on historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined  it is recognized over a seven year time period which is the estimated life of a gift certificate 
insignificant amounts have been recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in fiscal  and reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
variable interest entities we enter into flexible lease arrangements with certain operators who are not required to invest a significant amount of capital 
in addition  us franchisees participating in the fip fip franchisee do not have a significant amount of initial capital outstanding that is not financed directly by us 
because the legal entity within which such an operator or fip franchisee operates is considered not to be adequately capitalized  that entity is considered a variable interest entity vie as defined in the master glossary of the fasb codification and according to the provisions in asc formerly fin r 
based on our review of the financial statements we receive from these operators and fip franchisees  our projections indicate we  in some instances  are the primary beneficiary expected returns or losses as that term is defined by asc formerly fin r  of these vies 
accordingly  we have consolidated  on average   and restaurants  or approximately  and of our total franchise restaurants  at year end   and  respectively 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented on the consolidated statement of operations and noncontrolling interests are presented in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions within asc related to noncontrolling interests formerly sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 which required us to change certain of our classifications relating to minority interests 
we have no equity interest in any of our franchisees 
none of our assets serves as collateral for the consolidated restaurants  and creditors of these operators have no recourse to us 
the only significant exposure to us related to these vies relates to the collection of amounts due to us  which are collected weekly 
the agreements governing the license arrangements can be cancelled by either the franchisee or us with days notice  further reducing our potential exposure 
vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary have an inconsequential impact on our reported consolidated net income 
the impact of consolidating these vies to our consolidated balance sheets is also not significant 
there are a small percentage of restaurants considered to be vies in which we hold a significant variable interest  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this small percentage of franchise restaurants is also not material 
in connection with rsu awards granted to employees  we established the tdl rsu plan trust that purchases and retains common shares to satisfy our contractual obligation to deliver shares to settle the awards for most canadian employees 
for accounting purposes  the cost of the shares held by the trust has been accounted for as a reduction in outstanding common shares  and the trust has been consolidated in accordance with asc formerly fin r as a vie since the company is the primary beneficiary 
stock based compensation our stock incentive plan the plan is an omnibus plan  designed to allow for a broad range of equity based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units  stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  dividend equivalent rights ders  performance awards and share awards 
we currently provide compensation to certain employees under the plan in the form of restricted stock units and stock options with tandem sars 
in addition  we issue deferred stock units to our directors under our amended and restated non employee director deferred stock unit plan 
we previously issued restricted stock units to directors  but these were fully vested and settled in november we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc formerly sfas no 
r share based payment 
restricted stock units restricted stock units granted are measured at the fair market value based on the closing price of our common shares traded on the toronto stock exchange on the first business day preceding the grant date 
restricted stock units are generally expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses  consistent with the classification of the related employee compensation expense 
grants related to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
restricted stock units have ders 
in addition  we may grant performance conditioned restricted stock units to certain of our employees 
the performance component is based on prior year performance and is only used to determine the amount of units granted 
all other characteristics of the performance based restricted stock units are the same as restricted stock units when granted as the performance condition would have been previously satisfied 
deferred stock units deferred stock units are granted to non employee members of our board of directors and are expensed on the date of grant since they vest immediately  although they are not payable until a director s separation from service 
deferred stock units are notional units which track the value of our common shares 
these units are settled in cash based on the value of our common shares on the toronto stock exchange on the date of the director s separation of service from the company 
since the awards are settled in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed 
deferred stock units have dividend equivalent rights  which are expensed as earned 
stock options the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  the expected volatility of our common share price over the expected term  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the awards are accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period  and are expensed over the vesting period 
stock options with tandem sars see below granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
changes in subjective assumptions as well as changes in the share price from period to period  can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
we issued stock option awards with tandem sars for the first time to our named executive officers in fiscal and to all of our officers in fiscal stock appreciation rights sars may be granted alone or in conjunction with a stock option 
a sar related to an option generally terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture  or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars enable the employee to exercise the stock option to receive common shares or to exercise the sar and receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
segmented reporting we operate exclusively in the food service industry and have determined that our reportable segments are those that are based on methods of internal reporting and management structure and represent the manner in which our chief decision maker views and evaluates the various aspects of our business 
our reportable segments are the geographic locations of canada and the us recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas no 
 now codified within asc consolidations 
this statement amends interpretation r to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this statement also amends interpretation r to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  adds an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  and requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this standard is effective for annual reporting periods that begin after november  we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  as codified in asc revenue recognition 
the objective of this asu is to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
the asu also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and has expanded disclosures related to vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification  as codified in asc consolidations 
this asu clarifies the applicable scope and implementation issues of asc  originally issued as fasb statement no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  for a decrease in ownership in a subsidiary that is a business or nonprofit activity and expands disclosures about the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets 
this asu is effective for interim or annual periods ending on or after december  and should be applied retrospectively to the first time the we adopted fasb statement no 
the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
fair value measurements improving disclosures about fair value measurements  as codified in asc fair value measurements 
this asu provides amendments to asc that will provide more robust disclosures about i the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  ii the valuation techniques and inputs used  iii the activity in level fair value measurements  and iv the transfers between levels  and this asu is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain disclosures applicable to level fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to these various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure to our cash flows results from purchases by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from canadian operations to us operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were approximately million for fiscal in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations when we translate our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the fluctuations in exchange rates do impact our us segment operating results  and can affect the comparability between quarters and year to year 
also  from time to time  we hold us dollars and other us dollar net positions in canadian dollar functional currency entities to support our business needs as a result of our cross border structure 
the holding of us dollar net positions in these entities can cause foreign exchange gains and losses which are included in other expense income  net  and can  therefore  affect our earnings 
we seek to manage significant cash flows and net income exposures related to exchange rate changes between these two currencies 
we may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant impact on our cash flows or net income 
forward currency contracts are entered into to reduce some of the risk related to purchases paid for by the canadian operations in us dollars  such as coffee  including certain intercompany purchases 
we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
we have a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
to minimize this risk  except in certain circumstances  we limit the notional amount per counterparty to a maximum of million 
we have reviewed counter party risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million were outstanding as of january  and december   respectively  primarily to hedge coffee purchases from third parties  including intercompany purchases 
the fair value unrealized loss on these forward contracts was million as of january  compared to an unrealized gain of million as of december  at the current level of annual operating income generated from our us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 
commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  edible oil and sugar in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a minimum of six months  and we also typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange at the same time 
we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of these contract pricing techniques 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions 
while price volatility can occur  which would impact profit margins  we and our franchisees have some ability to increase product pricing to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to franchisee and customer acceptance  respectively 
in addition  we currently have purchase contracts in place for at least the first half of covering key commodities such as coffee  wheat  sugar  and cooking oils 
as we have stated previously  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions and foreign exchange rates at the time we make purchases beyond our current commitments 
higher commodity costs could also impact earnings from our joint venture operations 
interest rate risk in february  we entered into an interest rate swap for million of our million term loan facility to convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an additional million interest rate swap  resulting in a total of million in interest rate swaps outstanding in connection with our term loan 
the swaps convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps essentially fix the interest rate on million of the million term loan at and mature on february  the weighted average interest rate on the term debt  including the swapped portion  was for fiscal 
the interest rate swaps are considered to be highly effective cash flow hedges according to criteria specified in sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts as of january  was million  net of taxes of million 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income which would be reduced due to our variable rate investments  would not be material 
we have reviewed counterparty risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  and there is some ability to adjust prices 
however  if several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time  such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control and increased labour costs  we and our franchisees may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand
