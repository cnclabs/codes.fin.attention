item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our pipeline includes the following compounds target drug compound indication development status jak incb myelofibrosis phase iii incb polycythemia vera essential thrombocythemia phase ii incb other hematologic tumors phase i ii incb psoriasis phase iib incb rheumatoid arthritis phase ii c met incb solid cancers phase i sheddase incb breast cancer phase ii ido incb oncology ind cleared hsd incb type diabetes phase iib we licensed rights outside the united states to novartis and retained us rights this compound is a topical formulation  all others are an oral formulation we licensed worldwide rights to lilly and retained a co development and co promotion options we licensed worldwide rights to novartis and retained a co development and co promotion options we anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
we do not expect to generate product sales from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 

table of contents license agreements novartis in november  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
under the terms of the agreement  novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to incb and certain back up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications  including all hematological malignancies  solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases 
we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to incb in the united states and in certain other indications 
novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c met inhibitor compound incb and certain back up compounds in all indications

we also retained an option to co promote products in the united states 
the lilly agreement will continue until lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or  if earlier  the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms 
the agreement may be terminated by lilly for convenience  and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances  including material breach 

table of contents pfizer in january  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc for the pursuit of our ccr antagonist program 
pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of ccr antagonist compounds 
pfizer s rights extend to the full scope of potential indications  with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides  where we retained worldwide rights  along with certain compounds 
we do not have obligations to pfizer on pre clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications 
the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement 
prior to such expiration  either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party 
in addition  pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice 
we received an upfront nonrefundable  non creditable payment of million in january and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments 
restructuring programs in february  we made the decision to discontinue further development of our information products line  close our palo alto headquarters and focus solely on the discovery and development of novel drugs 
we still have a lease obligation for a facility in palo alto through march as a result of the long term nature of this remaining lease obligation  we will be recording a charge each period through the march termination date of the lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations 
the cash impact in from restructuring related charges was million 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock compensation  restructuring charges  investments  and convertible debt and derivative accounting  revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual property 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
we exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the 
table of contents sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the customer s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
under agreements involving multiple products  services and or rights to use assets  the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
when separate units of accounting exist  consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
research and development costs 
our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred 
we often contract with clinical research organizations cros to facilitate  coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug 
to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred  we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract 
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones 
in the event that we prepay cro fees  we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed 
most professional fees  including project and clinical management  data management  monitoring  and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period 
these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date 
our cro contracts generally include pass through fees 
pass through fees include  but are not limited to  regulatory expenses  investigator fees  travel costs  and other miscellaneous costs  including shipping and printing fees 
we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred  based on the best information available to us at the time 
the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the cros  internal reviews and a review of contractual terms 
the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled  duration of the clinical trial  estimated patient attrition  screening rate and length of the dosing regimen 
cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period 
stock compensation 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting guidance for stock compensation requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their fair values 
the accounting guidance also requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation and requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations 
we recorded stock 
table of contents compensation expense of million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
restructuring charges 
we estimate costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after december   including costs resulting from the cost to exit the facilities used for our genomics business  the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount  if any  of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees 
to form our estimates for these costs  we perform an assessment of the affected facilities and consider the current market conditions for each site 
we also estimate our credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected lease payments 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
our estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
we periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
we also make adjustments related to accrued professional fees to adjust estimated amounts to actual 
investments 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and if we intend to sell or if it is not more likely than not that the we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management determines that such an impairment exists  we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as long term marketable securities 
convertible debt and derivative accounting 
we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
if the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we monitor  on an ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 
due to the variable mix of common stock and series a preferred stock that would have been issued to satisfy the conversion of our convertible senior notes due until we had reserved sufficient shares of our common stock  the embedded conversion feature was not considered indexed to our stock 
as a result  the embedded conversion feature was not eligible for equity classification and was required to be bifurcated from the underlying debt instrument until we had reserved sufficient shares of our common 
table of contents stock 
accordingly  the fair value of the embedded conversion feature on september  of million was recorded as a derivative liability and the carrying value of our convertible senior notes was reduced to reflect a debt discount equal to the fair value of the embedded conversion feature 
the derivative liability related to the conversion feature was revalued on november   the date we increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance in an amount sufficient to satisfy conversion of our convertible senior notes 
the fair value of the derivative liability was increased to million as  among other factors  our stock price increased from september   and the change in fair market value of million was recorded in earnings 
as we had reserved sufficient shares of our common stock to satisfy the conversion provisions of our convertible senior notes  the conversion feature is considered indexed to our stock and the fair value of the conversion feature had be reclassified from a liability into stockholders deficit at december  the debt discount related to the derivative liability will be amortized to interest expense over the six year term of our convertible senior notes using the effective interest method 
we valued the embedded conversion feature using a single factor binomial lattice model  with the assistance of a valuation consultant 
this model incorporates inputs such as stock price  historical volatility  risk free interest rate  equivalent bond yield  as well as assumptions about fundamental change and note holder behavior 
results of operations years ended december  and we recorded net losses from operations for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss from operations was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the years ended  december  in millions contract revenues license and royalty revenues total revenues our contract revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the novartis and lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance periods 
the upfront fees related to the novartis agreement includes a million upfront payment received in  a million immediate milestone payment received in and million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement 
the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consist of a million upfront payment received in for the year ended december   contract revenues were derived from recognition of revenue associated with the pfizer upfront fee and research services provided to pfizer 
the increase from to primarily relates to amortization of the upfront fee received from novartis under our collaboration and license agreement 
our license and royalty revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
license and royalty revenues were derived from database subscriptions and licensing of our gene and genomic related intellectual property 
we expect that revenues generated from information products  including licensing of gene and genomic related intellectual property  will decline as we focus on our drug discovery and development programs 

table of contents for the year ended december  and  revenues from companies considered to be related parties were million and million  respectively 
our related parties consist of companies in which members of our board of directors have invested  either directly or indirectly  or in which a member of our board of directors is an officer or holds a seat on the board of directors other than an incyte held board seat 
operating expenses research and development expenses for the years ended  december  in millions salary and benefits related stock compensation clinical research and outside services occupancy and all other costs total research and development expenses we currently track research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project 
salary and benefits related expense increased from to due to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline 
stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted  stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity based compensation 
the decrease in clinical research and outside services from to is primarily due to prioritization of our pipeline to focus on products we believe have a greater likelihood of creating near term value 
the decrease in occupancy and all other costs from to was primarily the result of decreased depreciation costs 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including requests by regulatory agencies for more information  inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials 
in addition  the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended  december  in millions salary and benefits related stock compensation other contract services and outside costs total selling  general and administrative expenses salary and benefits related expense increased from to due to increased headcount 
this increased headcount was due to initial sales and marketing preparations for the potential commercialization of incb for myeloproliferative neoplasms 
stock compensation expense may 
table of contents fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted  stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity based compensation

the decrease in from was primarily attributable to a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates during and a million non cash other than temporary impairment charge recorded in interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in from is primarily attributable to the increase in coupon interest and accretion of the discount related to our convertible senior notes due issued in september loss on embedded derivative liability 
the loss on embedded derivative liability related to the conversion feature on our convertible senior notes due which was originally valued on september  at million 
on november   we increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance in an amount sufficient to satisfy conversion of our convertible senior notes  and we recorded a mark to market adjustment in the value of the embedded derivative liability to million as  among other factors  our stock price increased from september   which resulted in a million non cash charge 
as a result of the increase in our common stock authorized for issuance  classification of this embedded derivative as a liability is no longer required  and we have reclassified it to additional paid in capital 
loss on repurchase of convertible senior and subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our convertible senior notes due and million of our convertible subordinated notes due these repurchases resulted in a loss of million primarily related to the pro rata share of the unamortized debt discount from the convertible senior notes we repurchased during the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes 
due to our net losses in and  we did not have an annual income tax provision

table of contents in april  the fasb issued a staff position providing additional guidance on factors to consider in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a financial asset 
the guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   and we adopted this guidance commencing with our june  consolidated financial statements 
the implementation of this standard had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance related to assessing whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock for the purposes of determining whether such equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is subject to derivative accounting 
we adopted this new guidance effective january  pursuant to this guidance  at september   in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes due  the fair value of the embedded conversion feature on september  of million was recorded as a derivative liability and the carrying value of our convertible senior notes was reduced to reflect a debt discount equal to the fair value of the embedded conversion feature 
the derivative liability related to the conversion feature was revalued on november   the date we increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance in an amount sufficient to satisfy conversion of our convertible senior notes  increasing the fair value of the derivative liability to million as  among other factors  our stock price increased from september  the change in fair market value of million was recorded in earnings 
as we had reserved sufficient shares of our common stock to satisfy the conversion provisions of our convertible senior notes  the conversion feature was considered indexed to our stock and the fair value of the conversion feature was reclassified from a liability into stockholders deficit at december  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in april  the fasb issued a staff position which changes the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of the impairment to be recorded in earnings 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   and we adopted this guidance commencing with our june  consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources in millions december cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities working capital year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to our significant research and development expenditures  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in through and in through as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities  the issuance of convertible notes  cash received from customers  and collaborative arrangements 
as of december   approximately million of marketable securities were classified as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet as they had been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we have the intent and ability to hold them until the carrying value recovers  which may be longer than one year

available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there had not been a significant impact to our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during cash provided by used in operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was due primarily to the impact of the upfront payment received in related to our recent collaboration and license agreement with novartis 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities from to was due primarily to the increase in our net loss 
cash provided by investing activities 
our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long term investments 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  including possible earn out payments to former maxia stockholders  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities

in addition  we have funded an escrow account of million for the first six semi annual interest payments on our convertible senior notes due  these scheduled payments are not reflected in the above table 
the table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events 
the most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below 
commitments related to maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable 
in february  we completed our acquisition of maxia 
under the merger agreement  former maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock based upon the then fair value could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones are set to occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
in any event  no more than  shares of our common stock may be issued to former maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement 
none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  
table of contents we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs 
under these licenses  we may be required to pay up front fees  milestone payments  and royalties on sales of future products 
in february  the holders of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due elected to convert their holdings into  shares of our common stock 
on february  we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding convertible senior notes due and convertible subordinated notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest of million to the redemption date 
we used a total of million in cash to fund this redemption 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our expenditures in connection with potential repayments of convertible subordinated notes purchased by pfizer  expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations  expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into  including the agreements with novartis  lilly and pfizer  and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements 
changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we expect that future revenues generated from information products  including licensing of intellectual property  will continue to decline or remain steady as we focus on drug discovery and development programs and  in  will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness 
the indenture under which our convertible senior notes due are issued contains a covenant that  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  or sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of certain of our or their assets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the credit markets and the financial services industry recently experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events generally made equity and debt financing difficult to obtain since their occurrence 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to scale back our operations  delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities and money market funds  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities were million  including a funded restricted cash escrow account of million associated with the first six semi annual interest payments on our convertible senior notes due due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  the decline in fair value would not be material
