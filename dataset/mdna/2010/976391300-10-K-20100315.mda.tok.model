overview our business we are a real estate investment trust engaged in the business of owning and managing real property and real estate related assets 
our business objective is to maximize long term shareholder value through a total return value approach to real estate investing 
as a result of our emphasis on total return  while we seek to achieve a stable  predictable dividend for our shareholders  we do not select or manage our investments for short term dividend growth  but rather towards achieving overall superior total return 
we believe this approach will ultimately result in long term increased share value 
we operate in three strategic business segments i operating properties  ii loan assets  and iii reit equity and debt securities 
we acquire assets through direct ownership as well as through strategic alliances and ventures 
during we identified opportunities in loan assets which were being sold under distressed liquidation scenarios  pursuant to which we were able to acquire loan assets at substantial discounts 
in addition we recognized the opportunity presented in publicly traded reit equity and debt securities  which we believed to be mispriced by the public markets 
accordingly  during we focused our investment activity in these segments of our business by investing  in loan assets and  in reit equity and debt securities 
throughout we believed that sellers pricing of operating properties was not reflective of the expected future downturn in rents  occupancy and overall net operating income 
as a result  we did not grow our operating properties business segment through acquisition during instead  we sought to minimize the recessionary impact on our existing operating properties through leasing efforts  both with new tenants and with existing tenants  and through the restructuring of our marc realty joint venture 
details of these efforts are described below 
during  our primary sources of income were rental income and tenant recoveries from leases of our operating properties  interest income from our loan assets  and interest and dividend income and appreciation from our investments in reit securities 
in prior years  we have also had income from appreciation recognized on the sale of selected operating properties 
we expect that our future income will include these sources along with income from the payoff at par of loan assets previously purchased at a discount 
comparability of financial data from period to period the comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by several items including the timing of our property acquisitions and leasing activities  the purchases and sales of assets and investments  taking material other than temporary impairment losses on assets in our portfolio and the reclassification of assets 
in this regard  the comparability of financial results for the current periods were negatively impacted by the write down of our investment in lex win concord to zero during the second quarter of and the reclassification of certain marc realty assets from an aggregated preferred equity investment to individual common equity investments as of july  recent operating losses the downturn in the economy since late and the subsequent disruption of the capital and credit markets to date has affected our profitability 
we have experienced losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which are primarily attributable to our investment in lex win concord 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred losses from lex win concord of  in and  in during we wrote down our investment in lex win concord to zero as a result of recurring operating losses and the overall lack of clarity on the future recovery of the underlying collateral of the assets 
lex win concord s loan assets were purchased at the height of the real estate market and its borrowers ability to refinance these loans given current market conditions is uncertain 
additionally certain of lex win concord s lenders required significant repayments on their loans  which resulted in lex win concord having to sell assets in a down market  further exacerbating its losses 
operating properties acquisitions and dispositions there were no material acquisitions or dispositions of real estate properties for the year ended december  consolidated operating properties as of december   we owned and consolidated the operations of approximately  rentable square feet of office  retail  warehouse and mixed use space through our wholly owned and four partially owned operating properties 
the average occupancy of these consolidated properties was approximately for the year ended december  as of december  our consolidated properties were approximately leased compared to approximately leased at december  at january   our consolidated properties were approximately leased 
an overview of the significant leasing activity is as follows jacksonville  florida a significant portion of the decline in overall operating property occupancy during was due to the loss of two tenants who occupied a combined  square feet  or  at our jacksonville  florida property 
subsequent to year end  we leased  square feet of space at this property through july with the signing of this lease  the property is now leased 
the space was leased to a sports apparel and merchandise company for an initial term of months  with three  three year renewal options 
net rent payable under the lease commences in august at an annual rent of  increasing to  annually for august through july and thereafter increasing by an average of approximately per year for the balance of the initial term 
plantation  florida in april we entered into a lease extension and modification agreement with bellsouth telecommunications inc  the tenant at this  square foot  net lease office property 
the lease term was extended for ten years and the current annual rent was reduced to approximately  for the final year of the current lease term ending in march thereafter  the annual rent will be  through march  and then increase to approximately  through march  the kroger company in october the kroger co  our tenant occupying  square feet of retail space in net lease buildings notified us of their intention to extend their leases on  square feet in five buildings  exercise their purchase option on our  square foot property located in athens  georgia and not to extend leases expiring in october on five buildings containing  square feet 
of the properties where the kroger co 
has not exercised their renewal option  brokers have been engaged and the properties are being marketed for sale or lease 
andover  massachusetts in january  we executed a lease agreement with paetec communications  inc for  square feet  representing of the rentable square footage of the property  through september the annual rent is  for the first year   for the second year  increasing every two years thereafter 
the tenant has the option to purchase the building for  effective after january  through march  south burlington  vermont in january  we executed a lease agreement with fairpoint communications  inc  for  square feet  representing of the rentable square footage of the property  through january  the rent is  annually through january and increases to   and  each subsequent year 
churchill  pennsylvania we are currently in discussions with our tenant  viacom  inc  at our churchill  pennsylvania property whose lease expires in december the property has significant capital needs which we believe to be the tenant s responsibility 
our negotiations with the tenant could result in various potential outcomes 
as a result of our analysis of impairment with respect to this property  an impairment loss of  was recognized at december  lisle  illinois during we expect occupancies on our two suburban office properties with  and  square feet  respectively  to drop from and at december  to and in due to major tenant relocations and downsizing in this difficult suburban chicago market 
with respect to our debt exposure  each of our equity investments is essentially a stand alone business  such that any potential liabilities which might occur are limited to that specific platform or investment and are not recourse to our other assets 
consequently  our risk of loss is in each case limited to our investment in that particular venture 
inclusive of extension rights  we have one borrowing related to our consolidated operating properties with a principal balance of  scheduled to mature in additionally  there are  of scheduled principal payments due on mortgage loans in  approximately  is scheduled to be paid down or mature in and  is scheduled to be paid down or mature in or later 
with respect to the borrowing that is scheduled to mature in  we are currently negotiating with the lender for a one year renewal to march sealy equity investments as of december   we held equity interests in three real estate ventures with sealy co which have an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet consisting of office flex buildings and light distribution and service center properties 
the investment properties are located in northwest atlanta  georgia  atlanta  georgia and nashville  tennessee and had occupancies of  and  respectively  at december  this compares to occupancy of   and at december  the decrease in occupancy is the result of the current softening in the markets in which these properties are located 
the properties are being aggressively marketed for lease 
they continue to generate sufficient cash flow to service debt  meet capital expenditure needs and in  although reporting a loss of  due primarily to depreciation and amortization  we received cash distributions of  from operations 
the sealy properties have  of mortgage debt with no maturities until january marc realty portfolio as of december   we held equity interests with marc realty which consist of an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet of office and retail space which was occupied as compared to occupied at december  during we restructured our investments with marc realty 
pursuant to the restructuring  we transferred our interest in properties which we perceived to have less opportunity for superior returns on a risk adjusted basis  increased our interest in the downtown chicago properties and retained our interest in seven suburban properties 
in exchange  marc realty relinquished  of deferred returns due to them 
as a result  we effectively own of the equity in properties 
there are five downtown chicago properties which contain approximately  rentable square feet of the aggregate marc realty portfolio and  of our december  carrying value 
these five properties had occupancy of at december   compared to occupancy at december  they offer significant stability to our overall investment due to their size  locality  tenant composition and consistent results  even during times of difficult market conditions 
the balance of the portfolio  representing seven properties and  of our december  carrying value  contain approximately  square feet 
this subset of the portfolio is located in the chicago suburbs and was occupied at december  compared to occupied at december  the marc realty properties are encumbered with  of mortgage debt currently with  maturing in   maturing in and the remainder in or later 
we are currently negotiating with the lender to extend the total debt maturing in loan assets in addition to stabilizing our existing loan assets in  we continued to monitor and pursue new opportunities in the market 
in june we wrote our investment in concord to zero 
the most significant loan asset transaction was our purchase of a  first mortgage loan for  which is collateralized by a story   square foot office building located at spear street  san francisco  california 
after the initial purchase in june we split this loan in july into a  a note which bears interest at and a  b note which bears interest at and which may be satisfied at a discounted payoff amount of  simultaneously with the split  we sold to an unrelated third party the a note at par of  resulting in us having a remaining investment of approximately  on the b note on which we earn  annually in interest and on which we expect to receive  at maturity 
excluding the spear street transactions  since june we acquired loan assets with an aggregate face value of  for an aggregate purchase price of  at december  our aggregate loan assets carrying value was  
reit securities during we invested  in reit securities and have capitalized on the market mispricing of reit securities 
we recognized  in combined realized and unrealized gains on our securities in we held reit securities with a fair value of  at december  liquidity and capital resources at december  we held  in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and  in equity and debt reit securities 
in addition  we had the ability to draw up to  on our credit facility with keybank national association keybank 
liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments and other general business needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in the short term 
we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility and issuance of equity and debt securities  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required for our investment activities 
as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
as a result of this dividend requirement  we  like other reits  are unable to reinvest all of our operating cash flow and are dependent on raising capital through equity and debt issuances or forming ventures with institutional or high net worth investors to obtain funds with which to expand our business 
in order to better position ourselves to take advantage of investment opportunities  in november we completed a rights offering to shareholders of record on october  issuing of  common shares at a price of per share and converted  series b preferred shares into an equivalent number of series c preferred shares 
we believe the proceeds from the rights offering of  can be invested accretively within a reasonable time period and we believe  together with our existing liquid assets  provides liquidity sufficient to target a variety of investments 
as a result of the series b series c transaction  we believe that due to the reduction in our outstanding series b preferred shares to  shares which have a liquidation value of  we will have greater flexibility in the future to raise capital through the sale of additional preferred shares as the series c preferred shares permit the issuance of pari passu preferred shares  subject to certain limitations  whereas the series b preferred shares do not 
our primary sources of funds include the use of cash and cash equivalents  rents and reimbursements received from our operating properties  payments received under our loan assets  the issuance of equity and debt securities  interest and dividends received from investments in reit securities  cash distributions from joint ventures  borrowings under our credit facilities  and asset specific borrowings 
additional financing transactions during the year ended december  include the acquisition of  of our series b preferred shares with a liquidation value of  for  in cash  resulting in a net gain of  the extension of the maturity date of the mortgage loan on our river city property for a period of one year  the extension of the maturity date of our keybank mortgage loan for a period of one year  and the repayment in march of a  note payable 
cash flows our level of liquidity based upon cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately  from  at december  to  at december  our cash flow activities are summarized as follows in thousands net cash flow provided by operating activities net cash flow used in investing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities although our operating activities generated a net loss of  for the year ended december   operating activities generated positive cash flow of  our cash provided by operations reflects our net loss adjusted by i non cash items of  primarily related to equity losses from concord of  ii  of distributions from non consolidated interests  and iii a net decrease due to changes in other operating assets and liabilities of  see our discussion of our results of operations below for additional details on our operations 
investing activities cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the following  for purchases of available for sale real estate loans which represents the portion of the spear loan that was subsequently sold in july   for purchases of securities carried at fair value   for acquisitions of loans receivable   for additional loan advances   for investment in our equity investments  and  for investment in capital and tenant improvements at our operating properties 
these uses of investing cash flows were offset primarily by  in proceeds from the sale of securities carried at fair value   in proceeds from the sale of the spear a note   in proceeds from the repayment of loans receivable which were primarily short term loans made to concord  and  in net proceeds  primarily related to the release of funds held in escrow from the qualified intermediary for the sale of our biloxi  mississippi property 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the following  of proceeds from the issuance of common shares through a rights offering  and  of proceeds  primarily related to the application of escrow funds held as cash collateral and utilized to pay off the citibank note payable 
these contributions to financing cash flows were offset primarily by  for payment of the note payable to citibank   for dividend payments on our common shares  and  for mortgage loan repayments 
dividends since december we have paid regular dividends to our shareholders 
in paying dividends we have always sought to have our dividends track cash flow from operations 
as a result  while we intend to continue paying dividends each quarter  future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on the actual cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  utilization of available capital losses and net operating loss carryforwards  distribution requirements for reits under the code  and such other factors as our board of trustees deem relevant 
subject to the foregoing  we expect to continue distributing our recurring current cash flow after reserving normal and customary amounts thereby allowing us to maintain our capital 
in addition  when deemed prudent or necessitated by applicable distribution requirements for reits under the code  we may make one or more special distributions during any particular year 
in light of the foregoing  in we reduced our dividend from per share to per share for the first three quarters of and  as a result of the issuance of additional common shares during the fourth quarter of from our rights offering  the proceeds of which have not yet been invested into accretive investments  we reduced the quarterly dividend again to for the fourth quarter of this represents our existing budgeted recurring cash flow generated by assets currently owned and excludes any potential future cash flow generated from the investment of the substantial cash and cash equivalents on hand 
additionally  during a favorable investing environment  we expect that we will utilize our carryforward capital losses to shelter gains from the disposition of our assets so we may use the proceeds for investment 
we expect to continue applying these standards with respect to our dividends on a quarterly basis which could cause the dividends to increase or decrease depending on cash flow 
we paid regular quarterly dividends of per common share and we declared a special dividend of per common share in december  which was paid in january we paid regular quarterly dividends of per series b preferred share for all four quarters of and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our payment obligations under contractual obligations  including all fixed and variable rate debt obligations  except as otherwise noted  as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years mortgage loans payable principal and interest revolving line of credit principal and interest ground lease obligations advisors fee balance includes a mortgage loan payable with an outstanding principal balance at december  of  which we have one one year option to extend 
all the underlying lease agreements require the tenant to pay the ground rent expense 
advisor s fee based upon the terms of the advisory agreement  effective january   with no effect given to equity issuances after december  or to incentive fee compensation to fur advisors 
no amounts have been included for subsequent renewal periods of the advisory agreement 
we carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance covering fire  flood  extended coverage  acts of terrorism  as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of and rental loss insurance with respect to our operating properties where coverage is not provided by our net lease tenants 
under the terms of our net leases  the tenant is obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our operating properties which are generally non recourse to us  contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain at reasonable costs  it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio

critical accounting policies and estimates impairment operating properties we evaluate the need for an impairment loss on real estate assets when indicators of impairment are present and the projected undiscounted cash flows from an asset are not sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
the projection of cash flows used in the impairment evaluation involves significant judgment by management 
preferred equity investments we have certain mezzanine loans which are classified as preferred equity investments 
determining whether a preferred equity investment is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment 
this evaluation includes consideration of the length of time and extent to which the fair value of an investment has been less than its cost basis  our intent and ability to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery in value and the collateral underlying the investment 
loan assets loan assets are periodically evaluated for possible impairment in order to determine whether it is necessary to establish a loan loss allowance 
in some instances if a borrower is experiencing difficulties making loan payments we may assist the borrower to address the problems  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
a loan asset is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is then measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  we will establish an allowance for loan losses and record a corresponding charge to earnings 
significant judgments are required in determining impairment 
we do not record interest income on impaired loans 
any cash receipts on impaired loans are recorded as a recovery reducing the allowance for loan losses 
available for sale securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable equity security below its cost that is deemed to be an other than temporary impairment results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  and asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
judgments associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
equity investments equity investments are reviewed for impairment periodically 
equity investments for which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the trust evaluates if these are other than temporarily impaired 
contingent liabilities estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for contingent liabilities and other commitments 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
all of the estimates and evaluations are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from the estimates and evaluations 
variable interest entities we have evaluated our investments to determine whether they are variable interests in a variable interest entity vie 
a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that incurs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of its expected returns 
determination of whether we must consolidate variable interest entities requires significant judgments and assumptions to be made 
at december  we have identified three loans receivable  concord  and the marc realty equity investments and the preferred equity investment to be variable interests in a vie 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the underlying borrowing entities of these investments as we do not anticipate absorbing a majority of the expected losses due to our preferred return position
