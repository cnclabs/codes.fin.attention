item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and recent developments the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets primarily cash and cash equivalents  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of savings accounts  checking accounts  time deposits and fhlb advances 
the company s results of operations also are affected by its provisions for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest income currently consists primarily of service charge income  earnings on bank owned life insurance  gains and losses on the sale of securities and miscellaneous other income 
non interest expense currently consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  real estate or investment securities impairment charges  occupancy  data processing  professional fees  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
throughout and  and continuing into  there have been severe disruptions in the mortgage  credit and housing markets  both locally and nationally 
these disruptions have had a significant negative impact on real estate and related industries  which has led to decreases in commercial and residential real estate sales  construction and property values 
we have experienced a reduction in demand for new loans and an increase in the amount of non performing loans compared to year end at december   non performing loans represented of gross loans  compared to at december  also  the decreased demand for new residential mortgage loans and the increase in non performing loans has resulted in a contraction of our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the need to increase the provision for loan losses compared to should the housing market and economic conditions in the chicago area stagnate or continue to deteriorate  it will continue to have a material negative effect on the company s business and results of operation safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended  and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the company  are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and actual results may differ from those predicted 
the company undertakes no obligation to update these forward looking statements in the future unless required to do so under the federal securities laws 
factors that could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  the economic health of the local real estate market  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory provisions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan and securities portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  and accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 

table of contents average statement of financial condition the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average statement of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
average balances of loans receivable include loans on which the bank has discontinued accruing interest 
loan yields include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

amount is net of deferred loan origination fees  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts  and allowance for loan losses and includes non performing loans 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the years indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to increased liquidity from the decrease in securities available for sale in securities available for sale decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in securities available for sale was due to calls made on the securities from the issuers 
a portion of the liquidity generated in was used to fund growth in the loan portfolio 
during  loans receivable  net  increased million to million from million in  primarily due to loan originations being greater than repayments during other assets increased  at december  to million from million at december  primarily due to million of prepaid fdic assessments 
the prepaid amount will be used to fund fdic assessments over the next three years 

table of contents total liabilities at december  were million compared to million at december  deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  during  certificates of deposit and money market accounts increased million and million  respectively  as the bank priced these products to generate more liquidity while still managing its interest rate risk 
advances from the federal home loan bank decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the bank maintained sufficient liquidity levels to allow these advances to mature without renewal 
stockholders equity at december  decreased million to million compared to million at december  book value at december  was per share 
the decrease in stockholders equity from december  was primarily attributable to the net loss of million for the year  offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to a favorable change in the fair value of securities available for sale  net of tax  of  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general net loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a million net loss for the million increase in net loss was primarily due to a million increase in the provision for loan losses during and a million decrease in the income tax benefit  offset by a million decrease in non interest expense

table of contents provision for loan losses management establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information  and prevailing economic conditions 
management increased the weighting of the delinquency factor in the allowance calculation due to the rise in delinquencies during and the increase in non performing assets 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change 
the provision for loan losses was million and  in and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses increased significantly in primarily due to an increase in specific allocations on impaired loans 
allocations on impaired loans resulted from loan modifications considered to be troubled debt restructurings in  and an increase in impaired loans that are individually evaluated for probable incurred losses 
impaired loans were significantly impacted by declining real estate values collateralizing these loans 
the company s exposure to real estate values will impact future provisions for loan losses 
at december   impaired loans individually evaluated for allowance allocations totaled million of which approximately were in one to four family loans  were in multi family loans  were in commercial real estate loans and were in construction and land loans 
of the million in impaired loans  million or were with four borrowers  an investment company that owns multiple single family properties  a commercial real estate investor  a multi family real estate investor and a single family real estate developer 
of the total impaired loans  million required specific allocations of million due to loss exposure from collateral deficiencies 
should real estate values continue to decline in  additional allocations and provisions for loan losses will be required 
in addition to the million of impaired loans individually for allowance allocations  the company also has other problem loans that are being monitored  including million of loans classified as special mention due to potential credit weakness 
of these special mention loans  approximately were in one to four family loans  were in multi family loans  were in commercial real estate loans  were in construction and land loans and were consumer and other lines of credit loans secured by real estate 
management monitors these loans closely to mitigate losses 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses as of december  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 

table of contents non interest income non interest income in was  compared to  in the change was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from a lease executed during the second quarter of by a tenant at the bank s th street office 
based on the terms of the lease  the company expects  of annual rental income in future periods 
non interest expense non interest expense in was million compared to million in  a decrease of million 
during the company incurred  in other than temporary impairment losses on its securities portfolio compared to million in the other than temporary impairment losses on its mutual fund investment and equity securities portfolio were  and  in compared to million and  in  respectively 
real estate owned impairment and expenses were  in compared to million in  the decrease in real estate owned impairment and expenses was the result of a million writedown on the carrying value of two commercial properties in with no further writedowns in these decreases in non interest expense were offset by an increase in fdic premiums and regulatory assessments of  to  in from  in the increase was the result of a  fdic special assessment during and the overall increase in assessment rates charged by the fdic 
income taxes a  income tax expense was recognized in compared to the income tax benefit of million recognized in the income tax expense was due to the pre tax loss in being offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company recognized a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in due to uncertainty that deferred tax assets may not be fully realized 
factors that the company considered when recording the valuation allowance included that the company reported a net loss in the previous three years  fdic assessments are expected to increase non interest expense in future periods  and the uncertainty regarding further operating losses as a result of an increase in non performing assets 
if the company determines that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in future periods  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance by reducing the provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  proceeds from maturities and calls of securities  fhlb advances  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly 
table of contents influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank maintains a liquidity ratio substantially above the regulatory requirement 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
we are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
we maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
net cash from operating activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  proceeds from maturing securities and paydowns on mortgage backed securities 
net cash from investing activities was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
net cash from financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts  fhlb borrowings  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in addition to the purchase of treasury stock 
the net cash from financing activities was million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
at december   the bank exceeded all of the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized with a tier core capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank may also utilize fhlb advances or the sale of securities available for sale as a source of funds 
at december  the bank had outstanding fhlb advances of million and had the capacity available to borrow an additional million  if needed 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loss experience  economic conditions  information about specific borrower situations including their financial position and collateral values  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired 
the general component covers loans that are not impaired  and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 

table of contents there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some quantitative  while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
management is monitoring credit risk trends and the impact on the allowance for loan losses analysis 
securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at the estimated fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are included as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of deferred income taxes 
the fair value of certain securities is less than amortized cost 
when management believes the decline in fair values below the cost represents an other than temporary impairment  the loss is recognized on the income statement 
the fair value of certain equity securities was less than amortized cost during management believed it could no longer forecast a recovery within a reasonable holding period for these investments  the unrealized losses were deemed to be other than temporary  and the losses were recognized through earnings 
unrealized losses on the remaining securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers of these securities are of high credit quality  management does not have the intent to sell these securities and more likely than not the company will not be required to sell these securities at a loss  and the decline in fair value is largely due to current market conditions 
real estate owned real estate acquired through foreclosure and similar proceedings is carried at the lower of cost or fair value at the date of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell 
if the fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through expense 
losses on disposition  including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition  are charged to operations 
operating costs after acquisition are expensed 
management is monitoring the values of its real estate owned properties 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the assets will more likely than not be realized 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets would expire 

table of contents a valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level at which it is more likely than not that the tax asset or benefits will be realized 
in the event that the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets  the company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance by reducing the provision for income taxes 
commitments at december   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans of million  as compared to million at december  the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december  totaled million 
management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be renewed at the bank 
however  if these deposits are not retained  the bank may utilize fhlb advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new funds  which may result in higher levels of interest expense and affect the company s level of earnings 

table of contents the following tables disclose contractual obligations and commitments of the company as of december  total less than year years years after years time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb advances total contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years loans in process unused lines of credit loan commitments total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
as 
table of contents of december   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would be expected to have a negative impact on the bank s operating results 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors quarterly 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  and assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and  basis points

the bank and the company do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments in a material amount to control interest rate risk 
in addition  interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank and the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
