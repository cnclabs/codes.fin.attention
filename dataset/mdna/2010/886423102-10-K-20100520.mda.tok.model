our global vessel fleet in calendar year  the company embarked on a significant vessel construction and acquisition program 
this program facilitated the company s entrance into deepwater markets around the world and allowed the company to begin replacing its then existing fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels 
the vessel construction  acquisition and expansion program was initiated with the intent of strengthening the company s presence in all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s fleet 
during this decade  the company purchased and or constructed vessels for approximately billion 
to date  the company has funded all of its vessel commitment programs from its available cash  operating cash flow  and funds provided by the private placement of million in senior unsecured notes  revolving credit facilities  and various leasing arrangements 
the company s strategy contemplates organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and possible acquisitions of vessels and or other owners and operators of offshore supply vessels 
the company has the largest number of new vessels among its competitors in the industry  and it also has the largest fleet of older vessels in the industry 
management regularly evaluates alternatives for its older fleet 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the average age of the company s owned or chartered vessel fleet including stacked vessels but excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service at march  was approximately years 
the average age of the vessels that the company acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of its new build and acquisition program was approximately years 
the remaining vessels have an average age of years 
of the company s vessels  are deepwater class vessels  are in the towing supply supply class vessels  are crew utility class vessels and are offshore tugs 
at march   the company had commitments to acquire five vessels and build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world one of which is being constructed in the united states by the

index to financial statements company s wholly owned shipyard  quality shipyards  llc at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of which costs for the new build vessels totaled million 
in particular  the company is committed to the construction of anchor handling towing supply vessels ranging between  and  brake horsepower bhp  platform supply vessels ranging between  and  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  and two crewboats 
scheduled delivery for these vessels began in april with delivery of the final vessel expected in july the company also had at such date binding agreements to purchase five anchor handling towing supply vessels for a total cost of approximately million 
in april  the company took possession of three of these five anchor handling towing supply vessels  and plans to take possession of the fourth and fifth anchor handling towing supply vessels in may and june of  respectively 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels  and no payments have been made on the purchase of five anchor handling towing supply vessels 
the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction of the vessels currently under construction based on contract prices  and to fund the acquisition of the five anchor handling towing supply vessels was million at march  a full discussion of the company s capital commitments  scheduled delivery dates and vessel sales is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item also contains a table comparing the actual march  vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the three years ended march   and between april and march  the company also sold  primarily to buyers that operate outside of our industry  vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
in aggregate  proceeds from  and pre tax gains on  vessel dispositions during this period approximated million and million  respectively 
our vessel classifications the company s vessels regularly and routinely move from one operating area to another  often to and from offshore operating areas of different continents 
the company discloses its vessel statistical information  such as revenue  utilization and average day rates  by vessel class 
listed below are the company s five major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each class and the services the respective vessels typically perform 
tables comparing the average size of the company s marine fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in item of this report 
deepwater vessels included in this vessel class are large  platform supply vessels psvs and large  higher horsepower generally greater than  horsepower anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels 
this vessel class is generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
platform supply vessels  which have large cargo handling capabilities  serve drilling and production facilities and support offshore construction and maintenance work 
the anchor handling towing supply vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment  as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs 
also included in this vessel class are specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation  construction work  subsea services and or have fire fighting capabilities and or accommodation facilities 
these vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services but are outfitted and primarily intended for specialty services 
included in the specialty vessel category is the company s one multi purpose platform supply vessel mpsv  which is designed for subsea service and construction support activities 
towing supply and supply vessels this is the company s largest fleet class by number of vessels 
included in this class are anchor handling towing supply vessels and supply vessels with average horsepower below  bhp  and platform supply vessels that are generally less than feet 
the vessels in this class perform the same functions and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements services as their deepwater vessel class counterparts except they are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters 
crewboats and utility vessels crewboats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
these vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy or violence present concerns 
offshore tugs offshore tugs tow floating drilling rigs  assist in the docking of tankers  tow barges  assist pipe laying  cable laying and construction barges  and are used in a variety of other commercial towing operations  including towing barges carrying a variety of bulk cargoes and containerized cargo 
other vessels the company s vessels also include inshore tugs and production  line handling and various other special purpose vessels 
inshore tugs  which are operated principally within inland waters  tow drilling rigs to and from their locations and tow barges carrying equipment and materials for use principally in inland waters for drilling and production operations 
barges are either used in conjunction with company tugs or are chartered to others 
the company sold its remaining other type vessels during the first quarter of fiscal revenue contribution of main classes of vessels revenues from vessel operations were derived from the main classes of vessels in the following percentages year ended march  deepwater vessels towing supply supply crew utility offshore tugs other shipyard operations quality shipyards  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  operates two shipyards in houma  louisiana  which construct  modify and repair vessels 
the shipyards perform repair work and new construction work for outside customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
during the last three fiscal years  quality shipyards  llc constructed and delivered two foot deepwater platform supply vessels  two foot platform supply vessels  and is currently constructing one additional foot platform supply vessel for the company 
the two foot platform supply vessels were delivered to the company during fiscal  while the two foot platform supply vessels were delivered in december and late march the foot deepwater  platform supply vessel that is currently under construction is expected to be delivered in february customers and contracts the company s operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production throughout the world  which is affected by trends in worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices including expectations of future commodity pricing that are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources 
the activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost of exploring and producing crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  significant weather conditions  the ability of our customers to raise capital  and local and international economic and political environments 
a discussion of current market conditions and trends appears under macroeconomic environment and outlook in item of this report 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  including but not limited to  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
in recent years  consolidation of exploration  field development  and production companies has occurred and this trend may continue in the future 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies generally focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels  and reduce the company s revenues 
in addition  consolidation could result in the absorption of an oil and gas company with whom the company has a strong commercial relationship into another company with which the company does not or vice versa 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
as noted above  these time charter contracts are generally either on a term or spot basis 
vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the cost structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term because the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
for the year ended march   chevron corporation including its worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for approximately and petroleo brasileiro sa accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in management s opinion  the loss of these two significant customers could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the five largest customers accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues  while the largest customers accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues 
competition the principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessel equipment  price and quality of service 
in addition  the ability to demonstrate a good safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors 
the company has numerous competitors in all areas in which it operates around the world  and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive 
the company s diverse  mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its assets generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to its customers around the world 
management believes the company has a competitive advantage because of the size  diversity and geographic distribution of its vessel fleet 
economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world in which we operate  are also considered competitive advantages as is the company s strong financial position 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market over the next three years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels 
an increase in vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly in the context of declining levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
however  the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry also has a large number of aging vessels  including more than vessels that are at least years old  that are nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aging vessels would likely mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created with the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
it is unknown at this time the extent to which the recovery from the recent worldwide recession will influence the utilization of equipment currently in existence or the ultimate timing of delivery and placing into service of new drilling rigs  floating production units and vessels currently under construction 
analysts have reported some offshore vessel construction contract cancellations as a result of the foregoing factors  which may reduce the ultimate number of vessels built and delivered 
challenges we confront as an international offshore vessel company the company operates in many challenging operating environments around the world that present varying degrees of political  social  economic and other uncertainties 
we operate in markets where the possibility exists of expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our vessels or other assets  terrorism  piracy  civil unrest  changing foreign currency exchange rates and controls  and changing political conditions that may adversely affect our operations 
although the company takes what it believes to be prudent measures to safeguard its property and personnel against these risks to the extent practicable  it cannot be assured that the company will escape any of the aforementioned events  although the wide geographic dispersion of the company s vessels helps substantially mitigate the impact of these risks 
in some international operating environments  local customs or laws may require the company to form joint ventures with local owners or use local agents 
the company s international operations are carried out with due regard to the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control ofac  the trading with the enemy act  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and other applicable laws and regulations 
certain international environments in which the company operates are characterized by heightened levels of governmental corruption and local customs and practices that may conflict with the requirements of us law 
the company has adopted policies and procedures in an effort to mitigate these risks 
sonatide the company has previously reported in its periodic filings that it was in discussions with sonangol  the national oil company of angola  regarding a sonangol proposal to increase its control over sonatide marine services ltd  an angolan joint venture between sonangol and a tidewater subsidiary 
the company currently has an indirect ownership interest in sonatide 
the company also previously reported that it had reached agreement with sonangol on certain amendments to the joint venture agreement that would increase sonangol s control over the operations of sonatide 
thereafter  sonangol and the company continued to have dialogue regarding additional changes proposed by sonangol to sonatide s practices and procedures that  if adopted  would further sonangol s control over sonatide s day to day operations  including treasury functions 
in december   sonangol notified tidewater that the existing joint venture agreement  which was scheduled to expire on july  unless renewed  would not be renewed by sonangol  although sonangol advised that it was willing to discuss a new joint venture agreement 
the company is in constructive discussions with sonangol regarding the terms of a new joint venture arrangement although no assurances can be given that these discussions will be successfully concluded or whether such terms will be advantageous to the company 
in addition  over the course of the last several months sonangol has been willing to extend the term of the sonatide joint venture to fulfill several new or renewed charterparty agreements with customers for a substantial portion of the current fleet in angola that extend beyond july  failing to further extend the existing sonatide joint venture or reach a new joint venture agreement with sonangol could impair the company s ability to continue to effectively compete for business in angola in the future 
more tidewater vessels are deployed in angola than in any of tidewater s other countries of operation  and a significant portion of revenues derived from the company s largest customer  chevron  are derived through the company s operations in angola 
international labour organization s maritime labour convention the international labour organization s maritime labour convention  the convention seeks to mandate globally  among other things  seafarer working conditions  ship accommodations  wages  conditions of employment  health and other benefits for all ships and the seafarers on that ship that are engaged in commercial activities 
to date  this convention has been ratified by five countries  namely  the bahamas  liberia  marshall islands  norway and panama  representing of the world s tonnage 
if adopted by an additional countries  then within months thereof  the convention will become law 
some believe that this convention could become law in the company believes that the labor changes 
table of contents 
index to financial statements proposed by this convention are unnecessary in light of existing international labor laws that govern many of these issues 
the company is working with industry representatives to oppose ratification of this convention 
should this convention become law  the company and its customers operations may be negatively affected during the period of compliance 
government regulation the company is subject to various united states federal  state and local statutes and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of its vessels 
the company s us flag vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the united states coast guard  the united states customs service  the united states maritime administration and the national transportation safety board 
the company is also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where the company and its offshore vessels operate 
under the citizenship provisions of the merchant marine act of and the shipping act   as amended  the company would not be permitted to engage in the us coastwise trade if more than of the company s outstanding stock were owned by non us citizens 
for a company engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a us citizen i the company must be organized under the laws of the united states or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a us citizen  iii no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens and iv at least of the interest in such company must be owned by us citizens 
the company has a dual stock certificate system to protect against non us citizens owning more than of its common stock 
in addition  the company s charter provides the company with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of the company s common stock that would result in the ownership by non us citizens of more than of its common stock 
based on information supplied to the company by its transfer agent  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock was owned by non us citizens as of march  the laws of the us require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade must be built in the us in addition  once a us built vessel is registered under a non us flag  it cannot thereafter engage in us coastwise trade 
therefore  the company s us flag vessels must operate outside of the us coastwise trade 
of the total vessels owned or operated by the company at march   vessels were registered under flags other than the united states and vessels were registered under the us flag 
if the company is not able to secure adequate numbers of charters abroad for its non us flag vessels  even if work would otherwise have been available for such vessels in the united states  these vessels cannot operate in the us coastwise trade  and the company s financial performance could be affected 
all of the company s offshore vessels are subject to united states and international safety and classification standards 
us flag towing supply  supply vessels and crewboats are required to undergo periodic inspections twice within every five year period pursuant to us coast guard regulations 
vessels registered under flags other than the united states are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies  such as the american bureau of shipping 
the company is in compliance with the international ship and port facility security code isps  an amendment to the safety of life at sea solas convention  and further mandated in the maritime transportation security act of to align united states regulations with those of solas and the isps code 
under the isps code  the company performs worldwide security assessments  risk analyses  and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations 
additionally  the company has completed the process of installing automated identification systems  long range identification tracking system and ships security alert systems on all vessels that are required to have the respective systems 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
however  environmental laws and regulations are subject to change and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such laws and regulations 
further  the company is involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters 
in the opinion of management  based on current information  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition  the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
safety the company is committed to ensuring the safety of its operations for both its employees and its customers 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents safety challenges 
because the work environment presents these challenges  the company works diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
the company also regularly conducts safety training meetings for its seamen and staff personnel 
the company dedicates personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance 
the company s director of health  safety and environmental management is involved in proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries and reviews all incidents that occur throughout the company 
in addition  the company employs safety personnel at every operating location who are responsible for administering the company s safety programs and fostering the company s safety culture 
risk management the operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions and property losses to the vessel 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes the company to damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues or increased costs 
the company s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
the company also carries workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  director and officer liability  general liability including third party pollution and other insurance customary in the industry 
the company seeks to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates by maintaining a self retention layer up to certain limits on its marine package policies 
the company carefully monitors claims and participates actively in claims estimates and adjustments 
estimated costs of self insured claims  which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims  are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad  and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
the resulting economic  political and social uncertainties  including the potential for future terrorist acts and war  could cause the premiums charged for our insurance coverage to increase 
the company currently maintains war risk coverage on its entire fleet 
management believes that the company s insurance coverage is adequate 
the company has not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits  however  there is no assurance that the company s liability coverage will be adequate to cover all potential claims that may arise 
while the company believes 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that it should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable  it cannot guarantee such with the current level of uncertainty in the markets the company operates 
raw materials the company s wholly owned subsidiary  quality shipyards  llc  performs both repair work and new construction work for outside customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
the shipyard operations require raw materials  such as alloy steels in various forms  welding gases  paint  fuels and lubricants  which are available from many sources 
the shipyard does not depend on any one supplier or source for any of these materials 
although shortages for some of these materials and fuels have occurred from time to time  no material shortage currently exists nor does the shipyard anticipate any shortages 
the commodity price for iron ore  the main component of steel  is typically volatile  and shortages may occur from time to time 
seasonality the company s global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration  field development and construction work 
the company s us gom operations can be impacted by the atlantic hurricane season from the months of june through november  when offshore exploration  field development and construction work tends to slow or halt in an effort to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the us gom 
however  demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the us gom in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure 
the company s vessels that operate in southeast asia and pacific are impacted by the monsoon season  which moves across the region between september and early march 
the company s business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and global supply and demand conditions for the company s offshore marine services than any seasonal variation 
employees as of march   the company had approximately  employees worldwide 
the company strives to maintain excellent relations with its employees 
the company is not a party to any union contract in the united states but through several subsidiaries is a party to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the united states 
in the past  the company has been the subject of a union organizing campaign for the us gom employees by maritime labor unions 
these union organizing efforts have abated  although the threat has not been completely eliminated 
if the employees in the us gom were to unionize  the company s flexibility in managing industry changes in the domestic market could be adversely affected

risk factors the company operates globally in many challenging and highly competitive markets 
listed below are some of the more critical or unique risk factors that we have identified as affecting or potentially affecting the company and the offshore marine service industry 
you should consider these risks when evaluating any of the company s forward looking statements 
the effect of any one risk factor or a combination of several risk factors could materially affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and the accuracy of any forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
oil and gas prices are highly volatile commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile 
prices are extremely sensitive to the respective supply demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas 
high demand for crude oil and natural gas and or low inventory levels for these resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise  while generally  low demand for crude oil and natural gas and or increases in crude oil and natural gas supplies cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to decrease 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include  but are not limited to  the following global demand for the natural resources  the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as the level of production by non opec countries  political and economic uncertainties including wars  terrorist acts or security operations  advances in exploration and field development technologies  significant weather conditions  and governmental restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
prolonged material economic downturn in crude oil and natural gas prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
changes in the level of capital spending by our customers the company s principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies  foreign government owned or controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  such as  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
the company s results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending for exploration and field development by the companies that operate in the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to the demand for natural resources and prevailing commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
when commodity prices are low  the company s customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for onshore and offshore drilling  exploration and development 
the level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile  and that volatility is likely to continue 
other factors that influence the level of capital spending by our customers that are beyond the control of the company include worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring and producing oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  significant weather conditions  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  local and international economic and political environment  and the availability and cost of financing 
unconventional natural gas sources are exerting downward pricing pressures on the price of natural gas the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng export facilities around the world are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is expected to grow in the future 
there is a significant oversupply of natural gas inventories in the unites states in part due to the increase of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements unconventional gas in the market 
prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of natural gas  whether from conventional or unconventional sources  will exert downward pressure on natural gas prices 
a prolonged downturn in natural gas pricing would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies  which in turn  may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services 
this consequence could be particularly acute in the company s us operating segment  which is more oriented towards natural gas than crude oil production  and therefore more sensitive to the changes in the market pricing for natural gas than to changes in the market pricing of crude oil 
difficult economic market conditions uncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging for the company to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
the success of the company s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and commercial markets that are outside its control and difficult to predict 
uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values  which may lead many financial lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers  which  in turn  will adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
these factors may also adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial condition 
factors such as interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws including laws relating to taxation  trade barriers  commodity prices  currency exchange rates and controls  and national and international political circumstances including wars  terrorist acts or security operations can have a material negative impact on the company s business and operations  which in turn would reduce its revenues and profitability 
prolonged material economic downturn in crude oil and natural gas prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
prior to mid  oil and gas companies had increased their respective exploration and development activities in response to a very favorable pricing environment for oil and gas that existed at that time 
worldwide demand for oil and gas dropped precipitously and energy prices sharply declined during the last half of calendar as a result of a global economic recession 
over one year later  there are signs that economic improvement is underway  however  the pace of recovery and demand for energy and  in turn  offshore supply vessel services has been slow 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive the company operates in a highly competitive industry  which could depress vessel charter rates and utilization and adversely affect the company s financial performance 
we compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price  reputation for quality service  quality  suitability and technical capabilities of vessels  availability of vessels  safety and efficiency  and cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to another 
in addition  competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring  among other things  the awarding of contracts to local contractors  the employment of local citizens and or the purchase of supplies from local vendors that favor or require local ownership 
in general  declines in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry negatively affect the demand for the company s vessels and result in downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates reduce the company s revenues 
potential overcapacity in the offshore marine industry over the past decade  construction of offshore vessels of the types the company operates has increased significantly 
excess offshore supply vessel capacity likewise exerts downward pressure on charter rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and when vessels are mobilized between market areas 
while the company is committed to the construction of additional vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last several years 
a discussion about the aging of the company s fleet  which has necessitated the company s new vessel construction programs  appears in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item in this report 
also  please read potential overcapacity in the offshore marine industry risk below for further information that can exert downward pricing pressures on charter rates

index to financial statements the offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market over the next four years  according to ods petrodata 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels 
an increase in vessel capacity could result in increased competition in the company s industry which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates  which  in turn  would result in lower revenues to the company 
also  please read potential repeal or amendment of the shipping act may have an adverse impact on the company s us segment risk below for additional information that can increase vessels overcapacity in our us segment 
risks associated with operating internationally for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by its international segment 
the company s international vessel operations are vulnerable to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states  some of which have recently become more pronounced 
our customary risks of operating internationally include political and economic instability within the host country  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions by the host country please refer to item in this report and note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our venezuelan operations regarding vessel seizures  foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  an inability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  currency fluctuations  revaluations  devaluations and restrictions on repatriation of currency  and import export quotas and restrictions  most of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company is also subject to acts of piracy and kidnappings that put its assets and personnel at risk 
the increase over the last few years in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts has been well publicized 
as a marine services company that usually operates in coastal or tidal waters  the company is particularly vulnerable to these kinds of illicit activities 
although the company takes what it considers to be prudent measures to protect its personnel and assets in markets that present these risks  it has confronted these issues in the past and there can be no assurance it will not be subjected to them in the future 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 
operational hazards inherent to the offshore marine vessel industry the operation of any marine vessel involves inherent risk that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified 
our operations are also subject to various operating hazards and risks  including risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions and property losses to the vessel  damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of asset by foreign governments 
these risks present a threat to the safety of personnel and to our vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues  increased costs  property damage  and additionally  third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and certain exclusions 
we can provide no assurance  however  that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods  that we will be able to obtain insurance for all operational risks and that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise

index to financial statements failure to attract and retain key management and technical personnel the company s success depends on the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel particularly the company s area managers  fleet and information technology personnel and the company s ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of a number of the company s executive officers  area managers  fleet personnel or other key employees  or the company s ability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel could harm the company 
the company currently does not carry key employee life insurance payable to the company with respect to any of its management employees 
international operations exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk due to the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for some of our international contracts  a portion of the revenue and local expenses are incurred in local currencies with the result that the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
the company generally does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items  the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
consolidation of the company s customer base oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone consolidation  and additional consolidation is possible 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  development and production activity as consolidated companies focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels  and reduce the company s revenues 
in addition  consolidation could result in the absorption of an oil and gas company with whom the company has a strong commercial relationship into another company with which the company does not and vice versa 
risks associated with vessel construction and maintenance the company has a number of vessels under construction  and it may construct additional vessels in response to current and future market conditions 
in addition  the company routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services 
construction projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns  resulting from shortages of equipment  materials and skilled labor  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen design and engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment  and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals 
a significant delay in either construction or drydockings of vessels could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction  conversion or other drydockings 
significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the demand for vessels currently under construction may diminish from originally anticipated levels 
if the company fails to obtain favorable contracts for newly constructed vessels  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
also  difficult economic market conditions and or prolonged distress in credit and capital markets may hamper the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels or the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction or acquisitions 
in addition  there is always the risk of insolvency of the shipyards that construct or drydock our vessels  which could adversely affect our new construction program  and consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

index to financial statements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions  the company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
as a us corporation  the company is subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit 
the company has adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the fcpa  but it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the fcpa 
any determination that the company has violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and cash flows 
compliance with complex and developing laws and regulations the company s us and international segment operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations 
stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board and the united states customs service and their foreign equivalents  and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
the company s operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment  increased manning or operational changes 
some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether the company was negligent or at fault 
further  many of the countries in which the company operates have laws  regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped  and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernable even to experienced and proactive participants 
further  these laws  regulations and enforcement systems can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change 
while the company endeavors to comply with applicable laws and regulations  the company s compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful  and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions  imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of the company s operations 
these laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers or third party agents 
moreover  these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new  unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that the company may not be able to pass along to its customers 
any changes in laws  regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in order to meet the continuing challenge of complying with applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates  the company revitalized and strengthened its compliance training  makes available and uses a worldwide compliance reporting system and performs compliance auditing monitoring 
the company appointed its general counsel as its chief compliance officer in fiscal to help organize and lead these compliance efforts 
this strengthened compliance program may from time to time identify past practices that need to be changed or remediated 
such corrective or remedial measures could involve significant expenditures or lead to changes in operational practices that could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to the merchant marine act of  which provides that  upon proclamation by the president of the united states of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense  the secretary of transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us corporations  including vessels under construction in the united states 
if our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us federal government  we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessels in the case of a purchase or  in the case of a requisition  the fair market value of charter hire  but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages 
table of contents 
index to financial statements suffered 
although the purchase or requisition of one or a few of our vessels for an extended period of time will not cause adverse material negative financial effects to our company  the purchase or requisition of several or a significant number of our vessels for an extended period of time may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risk of changes in laws governing us taxation of foreign source income approximately of the company s revenues and net income is generated by its operations outside of the united states 
the company has enjoyed an average effective tax rate of approximately since fiscal  primarily a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of  which excluded from the company s current taxable income in the us income earned offshore through the company s controlled foreign subsidiaries 
from time to time  legislative initiatives are proposed to effectively increase us taxation of income with respect to foreign operations 
whether any such initiatives win congressional or executive approval and become law is presently unknown  however  if any such initiatives were to become law  and were such law to apply to the company s international operations  it would result in a materially higher tax expense  which would have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
potential repeal or amendment of the shipping act may have an adverse impact on the company s us segment the provisions of the shipping act restricting coastwise trade to vessels controlled by us citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by us citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade 
there have also been attempts to repeal or amend the citizen provision of the shipping act  and these attempts are expected to continue 
legal challenges against such actions are difficult  costly to pursue and unpredictable 
to the extent foreign competition is permitted to engage in us coastwise trade by vessels that are built in lower cost shipyards  owned and manned by foreign nationals with favorable foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than us citizens  such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s us segment operations 
however  for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by its international segment 
compliance with environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations and markets a variety of regulatory developments  proposals and requirements have been introduced in the us and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other gases 
if such legislation is enacted  increased energy  environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations 
these developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for the company s offshore supply vessels  which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production market 
although it is unlikely that demand for oil and gas will lessen dramatically over the short term  in the long term  demand for oil and gas or increased regulation of environmental regulations may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources 
unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known  we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to compete 
however  any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

the obama administration has also proposed reorganizing the mineral management service into two regulatory bodies  with one of the two bodies dedicated to regulatory oversight of offshore drilling operations 
the ultimate effects of the rig catastrophe  and the governmental and industry response to these events  could have a significant impact on the offshore e p industry and energy service companies that serve that industry 
among the possible future consequences of this event are additional regulatory oversight and control with respect to offshore drilling  a potential ban or restriction on oil and gas exploration in certain offshore areas  particularly deepwater drilling  and an increase in insurance premiums for casualty insurance that may be more difficult to obtain

the substantive areas of the internal investigation have been reported publicly by the company in prior filings 
special counsel has reported to the department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec the results of the investigation  and has engaged in a series of cooperative discussions with the two federal agencies as to the potential legal ramifications of those findings 
the following reflects the status of those discussions securities and exchange commission the company has reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the sec to resolve its previously disclosed investigation of possible violations of the fcpa 
under the proposed resolution  the company would consent to the filing in federal district court of a complaint complaint by the sec  without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint  and to the imposition by the court of a final judgment against the company  including a permanent injunction against us 
the complaint would allege civil violations of the fcpa s anti bribery and accounting provisions with respect to certain previously discussed conduct involving tax authorities in azerbaijan  and the fcpa s accounting provisions with respect to amounts paid by a subsidiary of the company to a third party customs broker to procure certain permits necessary for the company s vessels to operate in nigeria 
the final judgment would not take effect until it is confirmed by the court  and would permanently enjoin the company from future violations of those provisions 
the agreement in principle would require the company to pay a total of approximately million  consisting of the sum of million principally representing disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest payable at the time of settlement and a contingent civil penalty of million 
the contingent civil penalty would be payable to the sec in months  to the extent that the company had not agreed to pay fines or penalties of at least that amount to another government authority or authorities in connection with the matters covered by the internal investigation 
the financial charge associated with the proposed settlement with the sec was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and is included in general and administrative expenses 
the agreement in principle is contingent upon the parties agreement on the terms of the relevant documents  approval by the securities and exchange commission  and confirmation by a federal district

there can be no assurance that this settlement will be finalized  or finalized on the terms set forth above 
if the settlement is not finalized  the sec may bring an enforcement action against the company 
the company s current tolling arrangements with the sec extend through june  department of justice to date  the company has not reached any agreement with the doj regarding a negotiated resolution of the previously disclosed internal investigation 
based on discussions with the doj regarding the possible disposition of this matter  it appears likely that any negotiated disposition would involve charges and sanctions imposed by the doj  although the company is unable to predict at this time the nature and scope of such charges and sanctions and upon whom they would be imposed 
the timeframe for resolution of these matters is also uncertain 
given these uncertainties  the company is unable at this time to estimate the range of any monetary exposure that might arise from such a settlement 
as a result  no accrual for potential additional liabilities associated with a negotiated resolution with the doj has been recorded as of march  any fines or penalties paid to the doj would reduce the balance of the sec contingent penalty referenced above under the company s agreement in principle with the sec 
should additional information be obtained that any potential liability in connection with the resolution of these matters with the doj is probable and reasonably estimable  the company will record such liability at that time 
while uncertain  ultimate resolution with the doj could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible that if agreement is not reached  the doj may bring enforcement action against the company 
other items various legal proceedings and claims are outstanding which arose in the ordinary course of business

at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels  and no payments have been made on the purchase of five anchor handling towing supply vessels

in july  the company s board of directors authorized the company to spend up to million to repurchase shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the company announced on may  that its board of directors has extended this program 
the company will use its available cash and  when considered advantageous  borrowings under its revolving credit facility  or other borrowings  to fund any share repurchases 
the repurchase program was scheduled to expire on june   but has now been extended to expire on the earlier of the date that all authorized funds have been expended or june  unless extended by the board of directors 
no amounts have been expended under the july authorized program through march   and at march   million remained available to repurchase shares under the program until it expires 
during fiscal  the company did not repurchase shares of its common stock 
the company will continue to evaluate share repurchase opportunities relative to other investment opportunities and in the context of its financial position and then existing conditions in the credit and capital markets macroeconomic environment and outlook the primary driver of our business is our customers capital and operating expenditures dedicated to oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production 
our business is dependent upon our customers expectations for future oil and natural gas prices  economic growth  hydrocarbon demand and estimates of current and future oil and natural gas production 
the prices of crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in exploration and production e p companies decisions to contract drilling rigs in the united states us gulf of mexico gom market or to contract rigs in international markets 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship of crude oil  while the company s us results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for natural gas 
during late and early  prices for crude oil and natural gas fell dramatically from their respective peaks achieved earlier in calendar year due to a global recession that caused a precipitous drop in worldwide demand for oil and gas 
during most of calendar year  the global economy weakened  and many e p customers reduced their capital spending budgets in response to lower demand and weaker commodity prices 
during the company s fiscal  the global recession caused demand for offshore support vessel services to decline  particularly in the shallow waters of the us gom 
this reduced demand has led to an industry wide reduction in charter rates and utilization rates on vessels as our customers demanded pricing concessions 
in late calendar and into  there are some early signs of an economic recovery  although the pace of recovery has been slow and demand for energy continues to lag 
assessing the current market environment in the near term is challenging given the tenuous state of the global economy and of financial and commodity markets 
the company is evaluating the current trends in the global economy to determine how these trends are affecting the development plans of e p companies and global demand for its offshore vessels 
the company is also evaluating the impact of developments over the last months on the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels and the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction and or acquisitions 
in an effort to stabilize falling crude oil prices  opec cut approximately of crude oil production over the last months 
as calendar year progressed  oil prices gradually recovered and stabilized in the range of to per barrel as of mid april although this price range is far below its all time closing high of approximately per barrel in mid july  it is significantly higher than the low s price levels experienced during the first quarter of calendar to date  opec s market stabilization efforts have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements been successful  but opec officials warned at its march meeting that the strength in the global economic recovery was uncertain 
opec officials decided against increasing opec production levels because crude oil market demand fundamentals are still weak and inventories for the resource are well over five year averages 
given the historically strong correlation between commodity prices  drilling and exploration activity and demand for the company s vessels in the various international markets  the company expects that utilization and day rates for its internationally based vessels may remain weak or weaken further if crude oil prices decrease and or if capital spending by e p companies is constrained by expectations for either lower crude oil prices or weak economic activity 
during fiscal  the company s international customers  including some of our more significant clients  requested pricing concessions from the company  which the company has addressed on a case by case basis 
in response to the weaker crude oil price and its effect on e p spending  the company began stacking and removing from its active internationally based fleet those vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
oil and gas industry analysts reported in their e p expenditure surveys both land based and offshore that global capital expenditures budgets for e p are forecast to increase during by approximately over calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending budgets will increase approximately 
north american capital spending budgets are forecast to increase approximately  although most of that increase is expected to be onshore rather than offshore 
these budgets were based on an approximate average price per barrel of oil and an approximate per mcf average natural gas price for calendar given the long project lead times  the company believes that these spending increases will not take effect  in any significant way  until the latter part of calendar year and  as such  management does not anticipate a significant increase in our vessel demand until the later part of fiscal or sometime in fiscal the number of operating drilling rigs in the us offshore market is generally the primary driver of the company s expected activity levels and future profitability in the us market 
the offshore rig count in the us gom remains at historically low levels  in part because the strength of the international drilling market has attracted numerous offshore drilling rigs from the us to various international markets over the past few years 
exploration and field development activity in the us gom had fallen off significantly  particularly in non deepwater areas 
as a consequence  the demand for offshore marine vessels in the shallow water us gom diminished over the past few years and declined further in late calendar year and into due to the deterioration in the global business environment and economy  the significant reduction in commodity prices particularly natural gas pricing and the illiquidity in the credit and capital markets 
over the longer term  the company s us based vessel fleet should be affected more by the active offshore rig count in the united states than by any other single outside influence 
by mid april  the number of active drilling rigs operating in the us gom had risen to approximately rigs as compared to rigs operating at the end of september the increase in the rig count is attributed to higher natural gas pricing  which at mid april was trading in the mcf range due to a tightening of natural gas inventories resulting from a colder than normal north american winter season 
some drilling operators have expressed that the recent increase in us gom rig count is a result of the strengthening and stabilization of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices  a reduction in oilfield service pricing and improvements in the capital markets 
although the above positive trend bodes well for activity in the us gom market in the near term  the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng exporting facilities around the world are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market  which exerts downward pricing pressures on the resource 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is expected to grow in the future 
during the greater part of calendar year  natural gas inventories in the us have been significantly oversupplied  which is attributed to the increase of unconventional gas in the market  as well as a reduction in demand for the resource due to the global recession 
prolonged increases in the supply of natural gas  whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production  will exert downward pricing pressures on commodity prices for natural gas 
a prolonged downturn in natural gas prices can negatively impact the development plans of e p companies  which in turn  would result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services  primarily in the company s us segment  since it is more sensitive to the changes in natural gas pricing because it is more oriented towards natural gas than crude oil production 
given the historically strong correlation among commodity prices  drilling and exploration activity and demand for the company s vessels in the us gom  the company expects utilization rates and day rates for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements its vessels in the us gom market in the near term to remain relatively weak  particularly if natural gas prices deteriorate from current levels 
as such  management anticipates the company s us based results of operations during fiscal will likely be no more favorable than its fiscal results 
during fiscal  the company responded to the deterioration in the us gom market by stacking and removing from its active vessel fleet those vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
in addition  drydockings associated with stacked vessels have been deferred 
the impact of the recent rig catastrophe in the us gom may also have a negative impact on activity levels in fiscal and beyond 
as a result of the reduced number of active vessels in the us gom  crew personnel reductions took place  and effective june   wages on the remaining crew personnel in the us gom were reduced by approximately 
historically  when the us market weakened  the company would redeploy some of its highly mobile assets to international markets where  market conditions permitting  the vessels could benefit from stronger demand and average day rates and from statutory income tax rates that are generally lower than those in the us given the current challenges in international markets  the company s ability to mitigate the effects of a weak us gom market by redeploying vessels to other markets has been significantly reduced 
the company continues to assess the demand for vessels in the us gom and in the various international markets and may relocate additional vessels to international areas and between international areas 
the cost of mobilizing vessels to a different market is sometimes for the account of the company and sometimes for the account of a contracting customer 
the deepwater offshore energy market is a growing segment of the global energy market and is one sector of the global energy market that has yet to experience any significant negative effects from the global economic recession 
during the past few years  worldwide rig construction increased as rig owners capitalized on the high worldwide demand for drilling 
reports published during the most recently completed quarter suggest that over the next four years  the worldwide moveable drilling rig count currently estimated at approximately movable rigs worldwide  approximately thirty percent of which are designed to operate in deeper waters will increase as approximately new build rigs that are currently on order and under construction are delivered 
it is further estimated that approximately fifty percent of these new build rigs are intended to operate in deeper waters  suggesting that the number of rigs designed to operate in deeper waters could grow in the coming years by approximately one third 
investment is also being made in the floating production market  in which approximately new floating production units are currently under construction and are expected to be delivered over the next four years to supplement the current approximately floating production units worldwide 
however  analysts have reported that several drilling rigs currently on order have been cancelled and or delayed due to the uncertain economic outlook  which may reduce the number of rigs ultimately built and delivered 
moreover  to the extent the rigs are built and delivered  it is believed that the new build rigs will largely target international regions rather than the us gom due to longer contract durations  generally lower operating costs including insurance costs and higher drilling day rates available in the international markets 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only that are currently estimated to be under construction and that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market over the next three years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels 
an increase in vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly in the context of declining levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
however  the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry also has a large number of aging vessels  including more than vessels that are at least years old  that are nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aging vessels would likely mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created with the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects the new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
it is unknown at this time the extent to which the recovery from the recent worldwide recession will influence the utilization of equipment currently in existence or the ultimate timing of delivery and placing into service of new drilling rigs  floating production units and vessels currently under 
table of contents 
index to financial statements construction 
analysts have reported some offshore vessel construction contract cancellations as a result of the foregoing factors  which may reduce the ultimate number of vessels built and delivered 
principal factors that drive our revenues the company s revenues in both the international and united states segments are driven primarily by the company s fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates 
because a sizeable portion of the company s operating costs and its depreciation does not change proportionally with changes in revenue  the company s operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels 
principal factors that drive our operating costs operating costs consist primarily of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies and vessel operating lease expense 
fleet size  fleet composition  geographic areas of operation and the supply and demand for marine personnel are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in both the international and united states segments 
in addition  the company s newer  more technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller vessels 
the company believes that competition for skilled crew personnel may again intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build support vessels currently under construction enter the worldwide vessel population 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the company s crew costs will likely increase 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demand  vessel age and safety and inspection drydockings mandated by regulatory agencies 
a certain number of drydockings are required within a given period to meet regulatory requirements 
drydocking costs are incurred only if the company believes a drydocking can be justified economically  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition and future marketability 
if the company elects to forego a required drydocking  the company will stack and possibly sell the vessel  as it is not permitted to work without currently valid regulatory certifications 
when the company drydocks a productive vessel  the company not only foregoes vessel revenues and incurs drydocking cost  but also continues to incur vessel operating costs and vessel depreciation 
in any given period  downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenues and operating costs 
at times  drydockings take on an increased importance to the company and its financial performance 
the company s older vessels require more frequent and more expensive repair and drydockings  while some of its vessels built after are now experiencing their first or second required regulatory drydockings 
size and complexities of many of the new vessels also result in expensive drydocking costs  even in the early years of the vessels lives 
conversely  when the company stacks vessels  the number of drydockings in any period could decline 
the combination of these factors can affect drydocking costs and can incrementally increase the volatility of the company s operating revenues and operating costs  thus making period to period comparisons more difficult 
although the company attempts to efficiently manage its fleet drydocking schedule to minimize any disruptive effect on its revenues and costs  inflationary pressures on shipyard pricing experienced in recent years  and the heavy workloads at the shipyards  resulted in increased drydocking costs and increased days off hire at shipyards thereby  increasing the company s loss of revenue on the drydocked vessel 
the company cannot predict if the drydocking situation will improve in the foreseeable future 
if there is no improvement  the company expects that the timing of drydockings in the future will result in continued quarterly volatility in repair and maintenance costs and loss in revenue 
fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number and distance of vessel mobilizations that occur 
insurance and loss reserves costs are dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s safety record and the cost of insurance  and can fluctuate from time to time 
the company s vessels are generally insured for up to estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions  and property losses to the vessel 
the company also incurs vessel operating costs which are aggregated under the other vessel operating cost heading 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other miscellaneous costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements brokers commission costs are incurred primarily in the company s international operations where brokers assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers generally are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  commissions paid to brokers generally fluctuate in accordance with vessel revenue 
other costs include  but are not limited to  satellite communication fees  agent fees  port fees  canal transit fees  vessel certification fees and temporary vessel importation fees

international segment operations 
internationally based vessel revenues decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate seven percentage point decrease in utilization rates on vessels operating in international markets  reflecting weaker demand for the company s vessels 
average day rates for internationally based vessels increased a relatively modest during fiscal as compared to fiscal higher average day rates for internationally based vessels reflect a change in the mix of vessels operating during fiscal compared to fiscal leading edge day rates have generally been declining across vessel classes  however  the impact of this decline on average day rate statistics was mitigated by a change in the mix of vessels that were working in fiscal relative to fiscal in particular  the company stacked a number of traditional vessels in fiscal and the traditional vessels generally earn lower day rates than newer vessels 
as a result  the average working vessel in fiscal earned a higher day rate than the average working vessel in fiscal in addition  the company s revenues decreased during the comparative periods because of the loss of revenue from the seizure of its venezuelan operations 
the company s venezuelan operations contributed million of revenues during fiscal as compared to million of revenues contributed during fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to stack and remove from its internationally based active fleet vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had internationally based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels  sold vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to international service three vessels  resulting in a total of internationally based stacked vessels as of march  vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works by the number of days the vessel is available to work 
stacked internationally based vessels depressed international utilization rates during the comparative periods because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
the company s towing supply supply class of vessels were responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the number of towing supply supply vessels operating in the international market because of vessel sales  the seizure of vessels by the venezuelan government  and because of lower utilization rates resulting from weaker demand for the company vessels that continued to operate internationally

increases in revenues generated by the company s deepwater class of vessels offset some of the revenue losses of the other vessel classes operating in the international segment 
revenues earned by the deepwater class of vessels increased approximately  or million during fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite decreases in utilization and average day rates  due to an increase in the number of deepwater vessels operating in the international market following the addition of newly built deepwater vessels to the fleet and to vessels transferring from the us gom market

vessel revenues from us based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate percentage point decrease in total us utilization rates  which reflect the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the us gom market during the comparative periods 
average day rates increased approximately during the same comparative time periods  but the increase in average day rates was insufficient to mitigate the negative effects that lower utilization rates had on us segment revenues 
higher average us day rates reflect a change in the mix of vessels operating during fiscal compared to fiscal as was the case with international operations  leading edge day rates in the us segment generally declined across vessel classes  however  the impact of this decline on average day rate statistics was mitigated by the company stacking traditional vessels 
vessel revenues also decreased during the comparative periods because of the transfer of approximately three vessels to international markets 
in response to the deteriorating us gom market conditions  the company stacked and removed from its active fleet vessels that could not find attractive charter hire contracts 
at the beginning of fiscal  the us gom had stacked vessels

vessel revenues  utilization percentages and average day rates by vessel class for the us segment are disclosed in the vessel class revenues and statistics by segment section of this report 
us based operating profit decreased approximately million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower revenues 
reductions in revenues were somewhat offset by an approximate million  or  decrease in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs and repair and maintenance costs and an approximate million  or  decrease in depreciation expense resulting from fewer vessels operating in the us gom market during fiscal compared to fiscal crew costs decreased approximately  or million during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the transfer of vessels to international markets  reductions in crew personnel and wage reductions on crews staffing the remaining active vessels 
repair and maintenance costs were approximately  or million lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal because comparatively fewer drydocks were performed in fiscal versus fiscal and  because fewer vessels were operating in the us gom  comparatively lower expenditures were required for routine maintenance and repairs

fiscal compared to fiscal general market conditions international segment 
vessel day rates for the international segment moved higher during fiscal  largely due to an increase in drilling activity in the international markets 
in  capital spending budgets for exploration and production were based on strong crude oil pricing that occurred during the first half of calendar year the price of crude oil peaked at per barrel in mid july but fell to around the to price range around mid april opec responded to falling crude prices by cutting production in an effort to stabilize prices 
it was unknown at the time whether crude oil prices would stabilize at levels that would support significant levels of exploration and production spending by oil and gas companies 
demand for the company s vessels in the various international markets was strong during most of fiscal and began showing some signs of weakening as the fiscal year ended

demand for the company s vessels in the shallow water us gom offshore vessel market steadily diminished between calendar year to as numerous drilling rigs migrated to international areas to capitalize on strong market fundamentals that existed at that time 
in response to the departure of drilling rigs from the us gom  the company relocated vessels including two deepwater vessels to international locations during fiscal  where the vessels secured more attractive term contracts at generally higher day rates 
a net seven vessels were transferred to international locations during fiscal although the number of drilling rigs in the us gom was low  the market for offshore vessels tightened during the summer of due to an increase in e p drilling activity resulting from high natural gas prices  which reached the per mcf range in july  but which fell to the to range by mid april damage to the energy infrastructure caused by hurricanes gustav and ike  which hit the louisiana and texas coasts in september  strengthened an already strong offshore support vessel market 
the resulting offshore vessels supply demand fundamentals pushed vessel day rates higher in the us gom 
at the time  the us gom supply boat market had a significant number of vessels previously stacked that could have resumed active status after drydocking and recertification 
all of the company s available for work us based vessels were working at relatively full utilization prior to the storms  and  after the storms  two of the company s stacked vessels were drydocked and re certificated to respond to increased post hurricane market demand 
demand for the company s vessels was brisk for the majority of the company s fiscal second and third quarters 
demand waned throughout the fourth quarter due partially to the winding down of repair work on the offshore energy infrastructure and due to day rate and utilization weakness on the us based vessels that operated in the shallow and mid water depths of the us gom

even though vessel revenues for the international segment improved during fiscal  the revenues were adversely affected by an increased number of maintenance days on several of the company s larger deepwater class of vessels resulting from a higher level of drydockings that occurred during fiscal the increased number of maintenance days lowered the utilization and average day rates on the deepwater class of vessels during fiscal compared to fiscal the company s international deepwater class  towing supply supply class and offshore tug class of vessels generated approximately  and  respectively  of the revenue growth during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s deepwater and towing supply supply class of vessels generated increases in revenue during the comparative periods due to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally approximately four additional deepwater vessels and additional towing supply supply vessels  excluding vessel dispositions and due to higher average day rates

international segment vessel operating costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher crew costs  repair and maintenance costs and depreciation expense related to an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
international segment crew costs increased approximately during the comparative years due to inflationary increases in labor costs  the transfer of vessels from the us gom and the addition of newly constructed vessels to the international segment fleet at various times during fiscal repair and maintenance costs increased approximately during the comparative years due to an increase in the number of scheduled drydockings performed during fiscal  including several relatively expensive drydockings performed on the newer  deepwater vessels 
depreciation expense was approximately higher during the comparative periods because vessels were transferred from the us gom to international areas of operation and newly constructed vessels were added to the internationally based fleet during fiscal international segment vessel operating profit increased approximately  or million  during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher revenues  which were partially offset by increases in vessel operating costs as discussed above 
united states segment operations 
the company s vessel revenues generated by its us segment decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to fewer vessels operating in the us gom because vessels had been transferred to international markets and to a four percentage point decrease in total utilization rates on the remaining us segment vessels  which were somewhat offset by an approximate increase in average day rates 
the company transferred vessels to international markets including two deepwater vessels during fiscal because of a weak us gom market 
the weak macroeconomic environment in the us gom resulted in lower us based vessel utilization during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s deepwater class of vessels was responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because two deepwater vessels were transferred to international markets 
the company s towing supply supply class of vessels was responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an approximate five percentage point drop in utilization and the transfer of four towing supply supply vessels to international markets 
average day rates  however  increased approximately on the towing supply supply class of vessels 
the company s crew utility class of vessels was responsible for approximately  or million  of the loss in revenue during the same comparative periods due to the transfer of four crewboats to international markets and because of an approximate five percentage point decrease in utilization and approximately lower average day rates 
vessel revenues  utilization percentages and average day rates by vessel class for the us segment are disclosed in the vessel class revenues and statistics by segment section of this report 
us based vessel operating profit increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to approximately  or million  lower us segment vessel operating costs primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance costs  and insurance and loss reserves and approximately  or million  lower depreciation expense during the comparative periods resulting from fewer vessels operating in the us gom market 
crew costs decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to the transfer of vessels to international markets 
repair and maintenance costs decreased approximately  or million  due to fewer drydockings performed during fiscal and to a decrease in the average cost per drydock performed and to lower routine repair and maintenance costs during fiscal as compared to fiscal

vessel class revenue and statistics by segment vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created largely through the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated only on vessels in service and  as such  do not include vessels withdrawn from service or joint venture vessels

the company s vessel construction program has been designed to replace over time the company s older fleet of vessels with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels  while also opportunistically revamping the size and capabilities of the company s fleet 
the majority of the company s older vessels  its supply and towing supply vessels  were constructed between and as such  virtually all of this class exceeds years of age and could require replacement within the next several years  depending on the strength of the market during this time frame 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity  new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund current and future commitments in connection with the fleet renewal and modernization program

currently  the company is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements experiencing more pronounced delays in vessel construction progress at shipyards in brazil two crewboats vessels under construction and india one platform supply vessel under construction 
the company continues to work diligently to ensure as timely delivery as possible of these vessels  but further delay is possible 
the shipyard in india has previously completed and delivered three vessels for the company 
the company generally requires shipyards to provide third party credit support in the event that vessels are not ultimately completed and delivered 
that third party credit support typically guarantees the return of amounts paid by the company  and generally takes the form of refundment guarantees issued by major financial institutions located in the country of the shipyard 
while the company endeavors to reduce its shipyard credit risk by requiring these instruments  the ultimate return of amounts paid by the company in the event of shipyard default is still subject to the creditworthiness of the shipyard and the provider of the credit support  as well as the company s ability to successfully pursue legal action to compel payment of these instruments 
when third party credit support is not available or cost effective  the company endeavors to limit its credit risk through payment and other contract terms with the shipyard and other counterparties 
certain of the company s vessels under construction are committed to work under customer contracts that provide for the payment of liquidated damages by the company or its subsidiaries in certain cases of late delivery 
delays in the expected deliveries of any of these vessels could result in penalties being imposed by our customers 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these penalties  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

certain current and former subsidiaries of the company are  or have been  participating employers in an industry wide multi employer retirement fund in the united kingdom  the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf 
the company has been informed of a fund deficit that will require contributions from the participating employers 
the amount and timing of the company s share of the fund s deficit will depend ultimately on a number of factors  including updated calculations of the total fund deficit  theories of contribution imposed as determined by and within the scope of the trustee s authority  the number of then participating solvent employers  and the final method used in allocating the required contribution among such participating employers 
while there were no amounts expensed in fiscal years and related to this matter  the company recorded an additional liability of million during fiscal as of march   million remains payable to mnopf based on current assessments  all of which has been fully accrued 
in the future  the fund s trustee will likely claim that the company owes additional amounts for various reasons  including negative fund investment returns in a depressed global market as reflected in a preliminary future actuarial valuation  and the inability of other assessed parties to contribute their share of respective allocations  failing which  the company and other solvent participating employers will be asked for additional contributions

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of an contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions 
table of contents 
index to financial statements continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the costs structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term  for the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
receivables in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies 
the company routinely reviews and evaluates its accounts receivable balances for collectability 
when the company becomes aware of any uncollectible receivables  provisions for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded  which reduces the company s receivable balance 
the company believes its provisions for doubtful accounts to be adequate 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million provision to fully reserve accounts receivable payable by two of the company s customers located in venezuela

goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  utilizing carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its international and united states operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include prolonged adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 

table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company recorded million and million impairment during fiscal and  respectively  which was included in gain on disposition of assets  net 
no impairment was recorded in fiscal income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which it operates internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also have the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year

index to financial statements period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses the company self insures a portion of potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the accounting for these plans is subject to guidance regarding employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions including the discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets  health care cost trends  and other assumptions  all of which have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  expected returns on plan assets  amortization of prior service costs or benefits and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also sponsors a post retirement plan that provides limited health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
the company s newer technically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crews may intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build vessels currently under construction enter the global fleet 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the market for experienced crews could exert upward pressure on wages  which would likely increase the company s crew costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements strong fundamentals in the global energy industry experienced in the past few years have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide  and until the recent global recession  the price of steel had increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
the price of steel is high by historical standards 
although prices have recently eased with the reduced global demand of all commodities  availability of iron ore  the main component of steel  is tighter today than in when prices for iron ore increased dramatically 
if the price of steel rises  the cost of new vessels will result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expenses which will reduce the company s future operating profits  unless day rates increase commensurately 
during calendar year  steel market participants announced that they would reduce steel output in an effort to stabilize steel prices 
the stabilization of steel prices will depend upon many factors that will ultimately relate to worldwide demand for the product 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
however  environmental laws and regulations are subject to change and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such laws and regulations 
further  the company is involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters 
in the opinion of management  based on current information  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

interest rate risk changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
at march   the company had million outstanding of senior unsecured notes that were issued in july the multiple series of notes were originally issued with maturities ranging from seven years to years and had a weighted average remaining life of years as of march  these notes can be retired in whole or in part prior to maturity for a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make whole premium

foreign exchange risk the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  currency commitments  or to lock in desired interest rates 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company had foreign exchange spot contracts outstanding at march   which totaled million 
all spot contracts settled by april  the company had no spot derivative financial instruments outstanding at march  the company had no forward contracts outstanding at march  or march  at march  the company had one singapore dollar and six euro forward contracts outstanding

the six outstanding euro forward contracts  which totaled million  hedged the company s foreign exchange exposure related to the construction of two crewboats 
the construction commitment totaled a us dollar equivalent of approximately million 
the combined change in fair value of these seven forward contracts was approximately million at march   and was recorded as an increase to earnings during fiscal because the forward contracts did not qualify as hedge instruments 
due to the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the company generally does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
in addition  where possible  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams
