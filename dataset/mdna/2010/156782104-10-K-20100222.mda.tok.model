item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january   fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january   and fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on december  all references to years in this md a represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
management overview our revenues are primarily derived by selling  implementing and supporting software solutions  clinical content  hardware  healthcare devices and services that allow healthcare providers to securely access clinical  administrative and financial data in real time  allowing them to improve the quality  safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare 
we implement the healthcare solutions as stand alone  combined or enterprise wide systems 
cerner millennium software solutions can be managed by our clients or in our data center via a managed services model 
our fundamental strategy centers on creating organic growth by investing in research and development r d to create solutions and services for the healthcare industry 
this strategy has driven strong growth over the long term  as reflected in five and ten year compound annual revenue growth rates of or more 
this growth has also created a very strategic footprint in healthcare  with cerner solutions licensed by over  facilities  including approximately  hospitals   physician practices with over  physicians  ambulatory facilities  such as laboratories  ambulatory centers  cardiac facilities  radiology clinics and surgery centers  home health facilities  and  retail pharmacies 
selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element of our future revenue growth 
we are also focused on driving growth through market share expansion by replacing competitors in healthcare settings that are looking to replace their current hit partners or those who have not yet strategically aligned with a supplier 
we expect the hitech provisions in arra will create a period of increased demand within the united states during which we believe we can gain additional market share 
we also expect to drive growth through new initiatives and services that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate and expand our reach into healthcare 
examples of these include our careaware healthcare device architecture and devices  healthe employer services  cerner itworks sm services  cerner revworks sm services  physician practice solutions and solutions and services for the pharmaceutical market 
finally  we are focused on selling our solutions and services outside of the united states 
many non us markets have a low penetration of hit 
table of contents solutions and their governing bodies are in many cases focused on hit as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower the cost of healthcare 
beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth  we are also focused on earnings growth 
similar to our history of growing revenue  our net earnings have increased at more than compound annual rates over five and ten year periods 
we believe we can continue driving strong levels of earnings growth by continuing to grow revenue while also leveraging key areas to create operating margin expansion 
the primary areas of opportunity for margin expansion include becoming more efficient at implementing our software by leveraging implementation tools and methodologies we have developed that can reduce the amount of effort required to implement our software  leveraging our investments in r d by addressing new markets that do not require significant incremental r d but can contribute significantly to revenue growth  and  leveraging our scalable business infrastructure to reduce the rate of increase in general and administrative spending to below our revenue growth rate 
we are also focused on increasing cash flow by growing earnings  reducing the use of working capital and controlling capital expenditures 
results overview in a challenging economic environment  we continued to execute on our core strategies to drive top line growth  expand operating margins  grow earnings and generate good cash flow in the results included strong levels of new business bookings  earnings and cash flow 
new business bookings revenue in  which reflects the value of executed contracts for software  hardware  professional services and managed services  was billion  which is an increase of compared to billion in this growth was concentrated in the second half of  which included strong bookings growth that offset slight declines in the first half of the year 
the improvement in the second half of the year reflects slightly better economic conditions and some early demand driven by the hitech stimulus incentives 
our revenues remained flat at billion as compared to  with the lack of growth largely the result of the challenging economic conditions that persisted through much of the year 
additionally  our revenue comparisons in were impacted by a million cumulative catch up adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of  resulting from a significant change in an accounting estimate related to our contract in london as part of the nhs initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in england 
our net earnings increased to million compared to million in diluted earnings per share increased to compared to in the and net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of accounting for stock based compensation using the fair value method to measure and record expense for stock options  pursuant to accounting standards codification asc   stock compensation 
the effect of these expenses reduced the net earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  and the earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively 
our net earnings also include the previously discussed cumulative catch up adjustment 
the after tax effect of this catch up increased net earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively 
the growth in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by continued progress with our margin expansion initiatives  particularly expanding the profitability of support and maintenance revenue  leveraging r d investments  and controlling sales and client services expenses  partially offset by the catch up adjustment 
our operating margin was  compared to in  and we remain on target to achieve our long term goal of operating margins 

table of contents we had cash collections of receivables of billion in compared to billion in days sales outstanding decreased to days for the fourth quarter compared to days for third quarter and days for the fourth quarter 
approximately days of this quarterly decline is driven by the reclassification of our fujitsu receivables to other long term assets  which are not included in our days sales outstanding calculation 
the remaining decline is reflective of improved cash collections 
operating cash flows for were million compared to million in  with the growth driven by increased earnings and decreased use of working capital

support and maintenance revenues increased to million in compared to million in this increase is attributable to continued success at selling cerner millennium applications  implementing them at client sites and initiating billing for support and maintenance fees 
the growth rate of support and maintenance revenue was negatively impacted by the extra week in compared to and the catch up adjustment in services revenue  which includes professional services excluding installation  and managed services  remained flat  with growth in cernerworks sm managed services being offset by declines in professional services 
the decline in professional services reflects the impact of the economy and lower billable headcount in compared to contract backlog  which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue  increased in compared to this increase was driven by growth in new business bookings during the past four quarters  including continued strong levels of managed services bookings that typically have longer contract terms 
in the second quarter of  contract backlog was reduced by approximately million as a result of the contract withdrawal by fujitsu limited as the prime contractor in the southern region of england 
a summary of our total backlog for and follows in thousands contract backlog support and maintenance backlog total backlog costs of revenue cost of revenues was of total revenues in  as compared to in  with the slightly lower level reflective of the decline in technology resale  which includes higher third party costs 
the cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense  sales commissions  third party consulting services and subscription content  computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and software manufacturers for delivery to clients 
it also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers 
such costs  as a percent of revenues  typically have varied as the mix of revenue software  hardware  maintenance  support  services and reimbursed travel carrying different margin rates changes from period to period

other expense was million in  compared to million in as a result of entering into a settlement agreement with an investment firm relating to auction rate securities  other expense in includes the recognition of a gain of million for a put like feature 
this gain was offset by the recognition of an unrealized loss recorded on our auction rate securities due to a transfer of these securities from available for sale to trading 
our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to a higher than normal rate in the effective rate in was impacted primarily by a recognition of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of on certain of our foreign tax loss carry forwards 
such additional tax expense in was partially offset by a tax benefit for adjustments relating to prior periods 
the tax rate for was slightly lower than normal due to strong income levels from global regions that have lower tax rates 
during the second quarter of  we determined that due to a change in circumstances in the quarter  it was more likely than not that certain tax operating loss carry forwards in a non us jurisdiction would not be realized resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance totaling approximately million 
the valuation allowance was used in to offset a reduction in the operating loss carry forward for the non us jurisdiction

the higher cost of revenues was driven by a higher mix of hardware revenues in operating expenses remained flat in as compared to operating earnings of the global segment increased to million in from million in other  net net operating expenses not attributed to an operating segment increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased research and development and general and administrative spending and a settlement with a third party supplier in the second quarter of related to the prior period usage of their software in our remote hosting business 
the third party supplier settlement increased expense by million in the second quarter of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is influenced by many factors  including the amount and timing of our revenues  our cash collections from our clients  and the amount we invest in software development  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  which consist of money market funds  time deposits and bonds with original maturities of less than days and short term investments 
at the end of  we had cash of million  cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  as compared to cash of million  cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at the end of we believe that our present cash position  together with cash generated from operations  short term investments and  if necessary  our available lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during during the second quarter of  fujitsu services limited s fujitsu contract as the prime contractor in the national health service nhs initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the southern region of england was terminated by the nhs 
this had the effect of automatically terminating our subcontract for the project 
we are in dispute with fujitsu regarding fujitsu s obligation to pay the amounts comprised of accounts receivable and contracts receivable related to that subcontract  and we are working with fujitsu to resolve these issues based on processes provided for in the contract 
part of that process requires resolution of disputes between fujitsu and the nhs regarding the contract termination 
during the fourth quarter certain events occurred in the resolution process between fujitsu and the nhs which reduced the likelihood the matter will be resolved in the next months 
therefore we reclassified the receivables  which represented more than of our net receivables  from current assets to other long term assets during the fourth quarter 
these receivables represent the significant majority of other long term assets at the end of while the ultimate collectability of the receivables pursuant to this process is uncertain  management believes that it has valid and equitable grounds for recovery of such amounts and that collection of recorded amounts is probable 
in february and march  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the progressive failure of auctions representing all the auction rate securities held by us 
these conditions persisted through the remainder of and into during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement with the investment firm that sold us the auction rate securities 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we received the right to redeem the securities at par value during a period from mid through mid the settlement is in effect a put like instrument with a fair value generally equal to the difference between the auction rate securities fair value and par value 
in the fourth quarter of  these securities were reclassified to short term investments based on our intention to exercise the put like settlement feature and redeem the securities within the next year 
at the end of  we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the put like feature will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the consolidated statements of operations 
for a more detailed discussion of the auction rate securities  please refer to note  cash and investments  in the consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the auction failures to impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures or other business requirements

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  was issued  which will require an entity to apply the relative selling price allocation method in order to estimate selling price for all units of accounting  including delivered items  when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or acceptable third party evidence tpe does not exist and expands the disclosure requirements to require an entity to provide both qualitative and quantitative information about the significant judgments made in applying the guidance in asu and subsequent changes in those judgments that may significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and shall be applied on a prospective basis 
earlier application is permitted 
we are assessing the potential impact of asu on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  was issued  which requires the exclusion from the scope of asc of all tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and shall be applied on a prospective basis 
earlier application is permitted 
we are assessing the impact of asu on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  asu  accounting for transfers of financial assets  was issued  which among other things creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
asu is effective for financial asset transfers as of the beginning of fiscal years that begin after november  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are assessing the impact of asu on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  potential impairments of goodwill and income taxes 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this md a 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue within our multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method under asc  software revenue recognition 
key factors in our revenue recognition model are our assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of our software whereas implementation services are not  and the length of time it takes for us to achieve the delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software 
if our business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of our software  the period of time over which our licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of our licensed software over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
generally  both milestones are achieved in the quarter the contracts are executed 
if the period of time to achieve our delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software were to lengthen  our milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for our licensed software could materially change 
we also recognize revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method pursuant to asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts  as prescribed by asc our revenue recognition is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to complete a project which generally can span several years 
we utilize our historical project experience and detailed planning process 
table of contents as a basis for our future estimates to complete current projects 
significant delays in completion of the projects  unforeseen cost increases or penalties could result in significant reductions to revenue and margins on these contracts 
the actual project results can be significantly different from the estimated results 
when adjustments are indentified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate is recognized in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design  which is when we determine that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release  and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years 
we expect that trend to continue in the future 
if we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to  the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
we are amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon our forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs 
historically  use of our software programs by our clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more 
we expect that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the hit market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
fair value measurements we determine fair value measurements used in our consolidated financial statements based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access 
level valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents level valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of the end of  we held investments in money market funds  time deposits  commercial paper  government and corporate bonds and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are debt instruments with long term nominal maturities  for which the interest rates regularly reset every days under an auction system 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of auction rate securities  we utilize valuation models that are based on discounted cash flow streams  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation  including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated holding periods for the auction rate securities  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates  including the liquidity discount rate  applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of these investments could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
a considerable amount of judgment and estimation is applied in the valuation of auction rate securities 
in addition  we also apply judgment in determining whether the marketable securities are other than temporarily impaired 
we typically consider the severity and duration of the decline  future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
goodwill we account for goodwill under the provisions of asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value 
we assess goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluate impairment indicators at each quarter end 
we assessed our goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
in each respective year  the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by a significant margin 
we used a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing level inputs  to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
goodwill amounted to million and million at the end of and  respectively
