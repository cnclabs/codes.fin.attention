item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   august   and august  included in item of this report 
overview in fiscal year  we generated revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our luby s cafeteria branded restaurants located throughout texas and three other states 
on july   we became a multi brand restaurant company with a national footprint through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 
the fuddruckers acquisition added company operated restaurants and a franchise network of franchisee operated units 
this acquisition further expands our family friendly  value oriented portfolio of restaurants located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
in addition to our restaurant business model  we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities  college and universities  as well as businesses and institutions 
in fiscal years and  we continued to operate and compete  like many restaurant companies  in a challenging economic environment with customers seeking the most value for their dollar when they chose to dine away from home 
at the beginning of the fiscal year  we evaluated each of our stores and assessed each location s near term and long term value potential 
as a result  we made the difficult decision to close certain underperforming units 
we took this step in order to reallocate capital to better uses 
in fiscal year  we responded to the challenging economic environment by redoubling our efforts to attract customers into our restaurants with a focus on local restaurant marketing 
this included store specific menu offerings and limited time offers such as steak and shrimp on friday and saturday nights at select units  entr e portions of our customer favorites luby s fried fish and chicken fried steak at lunch  and all you can eat lunch or dinner buffets in certain locations 
in addition  in the second half of the year  we introduced an all you can eat breakfast buffet at a price point of that has become especially popular and has represented a significant portion of our customer count growth 
as we have focused more efforts on local restaurant marketing as well as on line marketing efforts  we turned to a positive and growing trend in year over year traffic comparables in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year while we have managed to grow our traffic  it has come at the expense of a lower average spend on each customer visit 
we expect one challenge in fiscal year will be to continue to balance this trade off between customer growth and average customer spend 
our current strategy is to build customer frequency by marketing quality offerings and brand loyalty 
in response to the economic environment  we reduced our capital spending to a level necessary to maintain the attractiveness of our cafeteria units  but we pared back on any major remodeling efforts 
we also benefited from the capital investment in our cafeteria units in recent years  which allowed us to reduce our capital expenditures in fiscal year as a result  we completed the year with million in capital spending  including investment in our contract culinary services business 
throughout the past several years  we have maintained a strong balance sheet  which contributed to our ability to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire fuddruckers and enhance the combined company s value 
working with our lenders to finance this transaction  we increased the size of our revolving credit facility from million to million 
we plan to service the debt  including principal repayments  through cash from operations  as well as from proceeds from the sale of assets 
fiscal review same store restaurant sales declined for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the negative trend in customer traffic in the first half of the fiscal year reversed in the second half of the year 
however  
table of contents throughout fiscal year  we experienced declines in average spend per person compared to fiscal year this decline was due to making available menu offerings and limited time offers at lower price points that were utilized to stimulate customer traffic 
we believe these initiatives and our local restaurant marketing efforts have gained traction  and we continue to receive favorable guest comments from the actions we have taken to make these value offerings available 
over the past fifteen quarters  we have experienced a same store sales decline on average of  this decline follows a period of twelve consecutive quarters when we averaged an increase in same store sales of per quarter 
net loss from continuing operations improved from a loss of million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year to a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year fiscal year profitability improved year over year  after adjusting for special items that we expect to be infrequent in nature  despite the decline in restaurant sales 
this profitability improvement was the result of careful cost management and operational focus 
the following provides a brief summary of selected expenses food costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  were flat year over year 
significant reductions in payroll and related costs were achieved through realizing efficiencies in crew scheduling  reducing crew overtime hours  and refining the mix of restaurant management and hourly crew required to operate each unit 
these cost savings were partially offset by higher average hourly wages 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  payroll and related costs improved basis points in fiscal year compared to last year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  other operating expenses improved basis points due to lower utilities  lower marketing and advertising costs were achieved by focusing on lower cost  but effective  local restaurant advertising and promotional activities instead of traditional mass media channels such as radio and billboard advertising and cost control efforts related to restaurant supplies and services 
depreciation expense decreased million and reflects the reduction in our overall capital spending in recent years as well as assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives 
the acquisition of fuddruckers occurred near the end of the fiscal year and therefore only partial offset the declining depreciation expense on the cafeteria units 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  but included approximately million in professional fees and integration expenses related to the acquisition of fuddruckers and million in legal fees and an accrual of an amount sufficient to cover a legal settlement agreement pending court approval as of year end 
adjusting for these costs  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million 
these savings were achieved through realizing the full year benefit of reductions in headcount at the corporate office and associated costs related to benefits  travel  supplies  and recruiting  as well as lower shared based compensation and lower recurring legal expenses 
income taxes reflected a valuation allowance decrease of million resulting in a decrease in fiscal year loss from continuing operations of approximately per share 
our culinary contract services business continued to grow through the execution of four new location service agreements 
we view this area as a growth business which generally requires less capital investment and more favorable percentage returns on invested capital 
our culinary contract services business generated million in sales during fiscal year compared to million in sales during fiscal year 
table of contents in fiscal year  we spent million on capital expenditures  which primarily represented maintaining our restaurant units to be attractive and efficient 
we did not complete any major restaurant upgrades in fiscal year our decreased level of capital spending was partly attainable because of the restaurant upgrades and capital investment into the units from recent prior years 
we remain committed to our operational procedures  policies and initiatives designed to strengthen and to grow our business 
these programs are focused on customer service  menu innovation  food quality assurance  technological enhancements and staff training and development 
the long term consistent execution of these programs is designed to enhance overall customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
our long term plan continues to focus on expanding both of our brands  including the fuddruckers franchise network  as well as growing our contract culinary services business 
we are also committed to reducing debt through sales of properties where we have closed restaurants as well as using cash flow from operations 
we believe our operational execution has improved through our commitment to higher operating standards  and we believe that we are well positioned to enhance shareholder value over the long term 
on october   we announced a cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan focused on improving cash flow from operations  which included closing underperforming stores in the first quarter of fiscal year in conjunction with these store closings  we incurred a non cash pre tax million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the closure of these locations eliminated negative cash flow incurred from their operations and is estimated to generate approximately million to million in cash from the sale of the properties based on current estimates of individual property values 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
accordingly  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
fiscal years  and all contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales decreased for fiscal year  decreased for fiscal year and increased for fiscal year the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters increase decrease fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales minimum wage increase impact the third of three federal minimum wage increases took effect on july  we expect to experience a compression due to these minimum wage increases  meaning that wages earned by employees within a certain range of the new minimum wage would be adjusted over time as the new minimum wage increases were phased in through calendar year 
table of contents discontinued operations our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan called for the closure of more than underperforming units 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been classified as discontinued operations 
results related to these same locations have also been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents general 
cash and cash equivalents was primarily affected by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers and the related financing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended august  our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
although the current macroeconomic conditions continue to affect our cash flows from operations  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
we plan to continue the level of capital and repair and maintenance expenditures necessary to keep our restaurants attractive and operating efficiently 
our cash requirements consisted principally of acquisition of substantially all of the assets fuddruckers  capital expenditures for culinary contract services development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital primarily for our owned restaurants and culinary contract service agreements 
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets fuddruckers in fiscal year required us to amend and utilize our amended revolving credit facility 
cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets contributed capital for debt repayments 
under the current terms of our amended revolving credit facility  as amended as of july   capital expenditures and the amount of borrowings are limited based on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  as amended  governing the revolving credit facility 
based upon our level of past and projected capital requirements  we expect that proceeds from the sale of assets and cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
however  high levels of accounts receivable are typical for culinary contract services and franchises 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase is due to an increase in cash provided by operating and financing activities 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants  enhance existing restaurants and to support culinary contract services 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended august  august  august  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
in fiscal year  operating cash flow increased million to million compared to fiscal year  primarily due to timing differences related to payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities

cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  due to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers  partially offset by proceeds from property sales and redemption of auction rate securities and decreased purchases of equipment and new restaurant construction in progress 
our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new restaurant and culinary contract service locations  restaurant remodeling  and information technology enhancements 
we used million for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our outstanding loan balance under our credit facility reached its highest point at million in conjunction with the closing of the fuddruckers acquisition 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities increased million from fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in debt in fiscal year status of long term investments and liquidity at august   we did not hold any long term investments 
the securities we previously held were long term municipal bonds with underlying maturities in years through these bonds historically had short term features intended for the investor s liquidity 
prior to the collapse of the auction rate securities market in february  these bonds were purchased or sold through a dutch auction process in short term intervals of  or days  whereby the interest rate on the security was reset 
in october  the company sought relief from the illiquid investments and by filing for arbitration against its broker with financial industry regulatory authority finra dispute resolution  inc and submitting a statement of claim for the par value of the auction rate securities 
the arbitration hearing took place in april  and a final award was announced on may  in our favor whereby the broker was ordered to purchase the auction rate securities at par value 
in june  we received million from the sale of the securities to the broker at par including interest 
as a result of the sale of these securities  we recognized a million net gain in fiscal year and an other than temporary impairment loss of million in fiscal years for additional information  see note  investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
given our current cash position  expected proceeds from the sale of assets  expected future cash flow from operations and our available borrowing capacity under our amended revolving credit facility as defined below  we believe sufficient liquidity exists for management to achieve its operating goals 
status of trade accounts and other receivables  net we monitor the aging of our receivables  including fuddruckers franchising related receivables  and record provisions for uncollectability as appropriate 
credit terms of accounts receivable associated with our culinary contract services business vary from to days based on contract terms 
working capital we had a working capital deficit of million as of august   compared to a working capital deficit of million as of august   primarily due to an increase of million in accrued expenses and other liabilities  a million increase in accounts payable offset by a million decrease in liabilities related to discontinued operations  a million increase in accounts receivables and a million increase in cash 
we expect to meet our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from property sales and availability under our amended revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures consist of purchases of real estate for future restaurant sites  culinary contract services investments  new units construction  purchases of new and replacement restaurant furniture and equipment  and 
table of contents ongoing remodeling programs 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were approximately million and related to upgrades of existing units  to improvement of our culinary contract services business and to development of future restaurant sites

at any time throughout the term of the facility  we had the option to elect one of two bases of interest rates 
one interest rate option was the greater of a the federal funds effective rate plus  or b prime  plus  in either case  an applicable spread that ranges from zero to per annum 
the other interest rate option was the london interbank offered rate plus a spread that ranges from to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option was dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date 

table of contents we paid a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused available balance of the revolving credit facility  which was also dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda  ranging from to per annum 
we also paid quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we paid the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility 
commitments and contingencies off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
pending claims certain current and former hourly restaurant employees filed a lawsuit against us in us district court for the southern district of texas alleging violations of the fair labor standards act with respect to the inclusion of certain employees in a tip pool 
the lawsuit seeks back wages  penalties and attorney s fees and was conditionally certified as a collective action in october on october  the company agreed to a settlement amount  subject to future court approval 
a million accrual for the related settlement amount was recognized in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter fiscal year from time to time  we are subject to various other private lawsuits  administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
a number of these lawsuits  proceedings and claims may exist at any given time 
these matters typically involve claims from guests  employees and others related to issues common to the restaurant industry 
we currently believe that the final disposition of these types of lawsuits  proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
it is possible  however  that our future results of operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to lawsuits  proceedings or claims 
construction activity from time to time  we enter into non cancelable contracts for the construction of our new restaurants 
this construction activity exposes us to the risks inherent in new construction including but not limited to rising material prices  labor shortages  delays in getting required permits and inspections  adverse weather conditions  and injuries sustained by workers 
contractual obligations at august   we had contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as described below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt operating lease obligations a uncertain tax positions liability b total amount of commitment by expiration period other commercial commitments total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in thousands letters of credit a operating lease obligations contain rent escalations and renewal options ranging from one to thirty years 
b the  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities 
the timing and amounts of future cash payments related to these liabilities are uncertain 

table of contents in addition to the commitments described above  we enter into a number of cancelable and noncancelable commitments during each fiscal year 
typically  these commitments expire within one year and are generally focused on food inventory 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase products from any single supplier 
substantially all of our product purchase commitments are cancelable up to days prior to the vendor s scheduled shipment date 
long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of august  included amounts accrued for benefit payments under our supplemental executive retirement plan of million  accrued insurance reserves of million and deferred rent liabilities of million

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards are recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  management will evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits of such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law 
we had deferred tax assets at august  of approximately million 
management has evaluated both positive and negative evidence  including its forecasts of our future taxable income adjusted by varying probability factors  in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
based on its analysis  management concluded that for fiscal year a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary 
the valuation allowance partially offsets our operating loss nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of general business tax credits 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  is necessary 
the valuation allowance offsets nol carryovers and carryovers of general business tax credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  is reported as part of the tax benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year two of the most significant items included in deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryovers and general business tax credits 
both of these items may be carried over up to twenty years in the future for possible utilization in the future 
the carryover of the nols began in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year if not utilized by then 
the carryover of the general business credits began in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year if not utilized by then 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and 
table of contents are subject to audit in these jurisdictions as well as by the internal revenue service 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open tax years 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
management has recently been notified that the irs will review the income tax return for fiscal year the details and scope of the planned review are not known at this time 
there are no other audits or reviews at this time 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets held for use and held for sale  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations and compare results of poorer performing locations to more profitable locations 
we also analyze lease terms  condition of the assets and related need for capital expenditures or repairs  construction activity in the surrounding area as well as the economic and market conditions in the surrounding area 
for assets held for use  we estimate future cash flows using assumptions based on possible outcomes of the areas analyzed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of our location s assets  we record an impairment based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
assumptions and estimates used include operating results  changes in working capital  discount rate  growth rate  anticipated net proceeds from disposition of the property and if applicable  lease terms 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity to assumptions made 
the time span is longer and could be to years for newer properties  but only to years for older properties 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows 
we operated restaurants as of november  and periodically experience unanticipated changes in our assumptions and estimates 
those changes could have a significant impact on discounted cash flow models with a corresponding significant impact on the measurement of an impairment 
we believe we have locations with an aggregate net carrying value of assets held for use of million where it is reasonably possible for an impairment charge to be taken over the next months 
gains are not recognized until the assets are disposed 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements to determine if they are definite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination or useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  contract term  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
investments investments include available for sale securities  classified as long term and reported at fair value 
securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities 
declines in fair value of available for sale securities are analyzed to determine if the decline is temporary or other than temporary 
temporary unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in shareholders equity 
other than temporary declines reduce earnings 
any increases in other than temporary declines in fair value will not be realized until the securities are sold 
property held for sale we periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held 
table of contents for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we analyze market conditions each reporting period and record additional impairments due to declines in market values of like assets 
the fair value of the property is determined by observable inputs such as appraisals and prices of comparable properties in active markets for assets like ours 
gains are not recognized until the properties are sold 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods 
share based compensation share based compensation is recognized as compensation expense in the income statement utilizing the fair value on the date of the grant 
the fair value of restricted stock units is valued at the closing market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
assumptions for volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield are used in the model 
new accounting pronouncements asu codifies sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r asu eliminates exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities  contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
asu changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated and also contains a new requirement that any term  transaction  or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity s status as a variable interest entity  a company s power over a variable interest entity  or a company s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purposes and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance amends the disclosure requirements 
table of contents related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance will become effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance to enhancement disclosures about the credit quality of a creditor s financing receivables and the adequacy of its allowance for credit loses 
the amended guidance is effective for period end balances beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the amended guidance is effective for activity during a reporting period beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements 
inflation it is generally our policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
certain increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our variable rate debt 
as of august   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our amended new credit facility was million 
assuming an average debt balance of million  a increase in prevailing interest rates above our interest rate floor per our amended new credit facility  effective july   would increase our annual interest expense by million 
although we are not currently using interest rate swaps  we have previously used and may in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion of our variable rate debt 
many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
