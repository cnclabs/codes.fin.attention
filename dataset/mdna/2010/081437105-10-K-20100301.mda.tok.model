item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis three years ended december  management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
three year review of results dollars in millions net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses all other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to bemis company  inc effective income tax rate overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
approximately percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include applications for medical devices  personal care  and lawn and garden 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets such as advertising  housing  and automotive 
the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading flexible packaging market positions in north and south america reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added  proprietary products 
we also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins and films  paper  inks  adhesives  aluminum  and chemicals 
market conditions the global financial crisis which started late in continued to dampen consumer demand in many regions around the world during while the majority of our products are sold for more resilient food applications  our customers who operate in the advertising  automotive  housing  and industrial product markets experienced weakness in demand for their products throughout the year 
in the food and grocery products markets  we experienced lower unit sales volumes but benefited from consumer trends that have prioritized value added products 
polymer resins  the primary raw materials used in our flexible packaging business segment  experienced significant volatility in recent years 
our operating performance benefited from a temporary margin increase as raw material costs decreased ahead of contractual selling price adjustments 
during the last half of  resin costs were relatively stable and the majority of our contract selling prices had adjusted to reflect the change in input costs 
subsequent event acquisition of alcan packaging food americas on march   bemis completed the acquisition of the food americas operations of alcan packaging  a business unit of international mining group rio tinto plc  for billion 
the acquisition will expand our global presence with food americas flexible packaging facilities in the us  canada  mexico  brazil  argentina  and new zealand 
these flexible packaging facilities  while owned by rio tinto plc  recorded net sales of billion in to the food and beverage markets and include expertise in foil and crystallized polyester technologies 
in compliance with regulatory requirements for approval of the transaction in the united states  bemis is obligated to divest certain alcan packaging food americas packaging assets in the united states within a specified time period after the closing date 
the packaging assets that will be divested produced annual sales of approximately million in and include manufacturing equipment used to produce packaging for fresh meat and retail natural cheese products 
the majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of through the issuance of million of public bonds and million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering 
the remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market in advance of closing 

table of contents results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income attributable to bemis company  inc diluted earnings per share versus for the year ended december   net sales decreased percent 
the effect of currency translation decreased net sales by percent in  while the june acquisition of a flexible packaging company in south america contributed percent to net sales growth 
net of these impacts  the decline in net sales during primarily reflects lower unit sales volumes in both business segments 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent decrease compared to per share for for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share included a per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees  acquisition financing  an administrative sales tax assessment  and severance charges  partially offset by a per share gain on the sale of an asset 
operating results for the year ended december  benefited from an increased proportion of net sales of value added products and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year 
versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent  reflecting increased raw material costs incorporated into higher selling prices during the year 
unit volume sold into certain food packaging markets increased compared to  while unit volumes declined in advertising  display film  and construction related markets that are more sensitive to economic conditions 
currency translation benefits increased net sales by percent 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent decrease compared to per share for in  diluted earnings per share included per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
higher raw material costs in negatively impacted gross margins 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including packaging for products such as meat and cheese  dairy and liquids  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  medical devices  bakery  and dry foods 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture multilayer film products 
our method of passing on input cost changes to customers through regularly adjusted contractual selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag 
this methodology creates a short term  negative impact on operating profit margins during periods of rapid raw material cost increases and a short term  positive impact on operating profit margins during periods of rapid raw materials cost declines 
raw material costs have been quite volatile over the past few years 
during the first half of  raw material costs increased substantially  negatively impacting operating margins during this was followed by rapid decreases in raw material costs which benefited operating margins during the first half of raw material costs were relatively stable during the latter half of acquisition of south american rigid packaging operations of huhtamaki oyj on june   bemis acquired the south american rigid packaging operations of huhtamaki oyj  a global manufacturer of consumer and specialty packaging 
this rigid packaging business  which includes three facilities in brazil and one facility in argentina  recorded annual net sales of approximately million in  primarily to dairy and food service markets 
the purchase price of million was paid with a combination of million cash on hand  million of debt assumed  and an million note payable to the seller  the majority of which was paid during dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment decreased percent in currency effects accounted for a sales decline of percent compared to and the operations of huhtamaki oyj  acquired in june  accounted for million of net sales following the acquisition  increasing net sales by percent 
the remaining percent decrease in net sales reflects both lower selling prices and unit sales volume 
generally lower net sales of flexible packaging for markets such as meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  pet food  bakery products  overwrap for bottled beverages  health and hygiene  and industrial products reflects decreased consumer demand for products in those areas 
these market segment applications represent approximately percent of our total flexible packaging net sales and offset modestly higher net sales of value added packaging applications in other market segments such as dairy  liquids  and medical products 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in this improvement reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix and production efficiency initiatives  as well as lower input costs experienced during the first half of the improvement in sales mix during is attributable to an increased proportion of net sales represented by value added packaging which incorporates consumer convenience features and extends shelf life 
net sales of packaging for less complex 
table of contents applications generally experienced the largest unit volume decrease during in comparison  operating margins during were negatively impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs during the summer months 
versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased percent in  principally reflecting the impact of higher selling prices 
currency effects accounted for sales growth of percent during increases in net sales of packaging for meat and cheese  dairy and liquids  bakery products  and medical products markets reflected higher unit volume 
these markets represent approximately percent of total flexible packaging net sales 
net sales also increased in packaging for dry foods  health and hygiene  and industrial product markets  driven primarily by higher selling prices 
these markets represent approximately percent of flexible packaging net sales 
we experienced lower net sales in the remaining percent of our flexible packaging market categories as a result of lower unit volume 
these lower volume markets include confectionery and snack markets  pet products  overwrap film for bottled water  frozen foods  lawn and garden  and protective display films 
non discretionary food markets have historically provided defensive characteristics during times of economic weakness 
markets for protective display films and packaging for discretionary food and consumer products have been negatively impacted during the recent economic downturn 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in from percent in restructuring and related activities increased operating income by million 
raw material prices increased substantially during the first eight months of  and many specialty materials used in our food packaging products maintained those prices through the end of the year 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products through three product lines prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of percent in currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of percent 
the balance of the decrease reflects dramatically lower unit sales volumes compared to the markets for our graphic and technical products  which represent about percent of total business segment sales  have experienced significant demand declines in light of weak global economic conditions  resulting in net sales declines for those products in excess of percent 
operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting the decline in unit sales volumes  particularly in high value added graphic and technical product lines 
operating profit in includes severance charges totaling million related to workforce reductions intended to better match capacity levels with current production needs 
versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of percent in  reflecting a benefit from currency translation of percent which was more than offset by lower unit sales 
unit volumes declined in each of our pressure sensitive product lines  partially offset by increased label products prices and improved sales mix for technical products 
our label and graphic product lines represent percent of our pressure sensitive materials net sales 
operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting decreased unit sales volumes across all product lines 
consolidated gross margin dollars in millions gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales improved sales mix  production efficiency initiatives  and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year  each contributed to the improved gross margin in input costs moderated during the second half of  reducing the positive impact of the contractual lag in selling price adjustments 
improved sales mix throughout was driven by increased sales of value added flexible packaging products 
gross margins in were negatively impacted by dramatic  short lived raw material cost increases during the year 

table of contents consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in primarily as a result of higher benefit and incentive plan costs during the year 
the increase in the ratio of these expenses to net sales in was magnified by lower sales levels for the year ended december  other expenses dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales interest expense effective interest rate other costs income  net income taxes effective tax rate research and development our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense interest expense increased by million during interest expense includes interest costs of million associated with public bonds issued in july of to finance the acquisition of the alcan packaging food americas business 
the percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is percent in  percent in  and percent in variable interest rates remained low in  and we dedicated our excess cash flow to debt reduction throughout the year 
other costs income  net for the year ended december   other costs and income included million of acquisition related professional fees and related expenses associated with the acquisition of the alcan packaging food americas business 
financial income recorded in was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in financial income primarily reflects a decline in interest income from lower cash balances invested outside of the united states in financial income also includes fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit 
these fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in south america and are expected to continue over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region 
net foreign exchange gains totaled million in compared to a net foreign exchange loss of million in during  other costs and income also included a million accrual for an administrative sales tax assessment and a gain of million on the sale of a property 
in  other costs income included million of financial income  about half of which related to interest income on cash held at non us locations 
income taxes the difference between our overall tax rate of percent in  percent in  and percent in and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interest primarily represents the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga  our brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization debt to total capitalization which includes total debt  long term deferred tax liabilities  and equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december   and percent at december  total debt was  million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
the increase in debt during reflects million of public bonds issued in july in anticipation of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition  net of a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned bemis company long term investment grade credit ratings of bbb from standard poor s and baa from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and prime for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investor service  respectively 
our ratings have been revised to reflect the impact of 
table of contents the additional debt issued to finance the acquisition of alcan packaging food americas 
these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
net cash flow from operations net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in during  an emphasis on aggressive cost management  production efficiency  and working capital management all contributed to this improvement in cash flow 
net cash provided by operations was reduced by a voluntary pension contribution to our us pension plans of million in contributions of million and million were made to our us pension plans in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our us pension plans in we expect to fund this contribution with cash provided by operations 
acquisition financing on july   we issued million of bonds due in with a fixed interest rate of percent and million of bonds due in with a fixed interest rate of percent 
the proceeds of these bonds were used as partial funding of the acquisition of the alcan packaging food americas business completed on march  during the third quarter of  we issued million shares of common stock through a public stock offering 
the million of net proceeds from this stock offering was also used as partial funding of the alcan packaging food americas business 
the remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market in advance of closing 
available financing in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
as of december   bemis had available from its banks a million revolving credit facility 
this credit facility is used principally as back up for our commercial paper program 
our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the revolving credit agreement includes a combined million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
upon completion of the alcan packaging food americas business acquisition on march   an amendment to the revolving credit facility became effective  increasing credit available and therefore total commercial paper capacity from million to million 
if this revolving credit facility were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate 
commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires on april  liquidity outlook on december   our revolving credit facilities supported total commercial paper outstanding of million  industrial revenue bonds outstanding of million  and multicurrency loans outstanding of million 
as a result  we had the capacity to borrow an additional million under the credit facility as of december  in connection with the completion of the acquisition of alcan packaging food americas on march   an amendment to our existing revolving credit facility became effective and increased our available credit by million 
this amended balance of available credit  combined with future cash flows from operations  are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash obligations projected for  including acquisition related payments 
management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward 
we do not expect our liquidity needs to be materially impacted by the completion of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions 
in addition  substantial increases in raw material costs could increase our short term liquidity needs 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in spending levels for and reflect the positive impact of improved capacity utilization initiatives combined with a general slowdown in sales volume 
during  we completed a multiyear investment for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets  a platform for formable  rigid packaging products  additional converting equipment in our malaysian operation  and proprietary film production capacity for european markets 
over the long term  we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 

table of contents share repurchases no shares were repurchased during during  we purchased million shares of common stock 
during  we purchased million shares of common stock 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to million additional shares of common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  operating lease obligations  and certain other purchase obligations as of december  capital leases are insignificant 
contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations interest expense operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance  the company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on april  a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 
interest rate swaps in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expired on the date the related notes matured in august  reduced the interest cost of the notes from percent to about percent in and market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
a portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
our business in brazil holds us dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the brazilian real 
in order to hedge this exposure  we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt  effectively converting a portion of the us denominated debt to the local currency 
we have not designated these 
table of contents derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
at december  and  we had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
the net settlement amounts fair value related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the underlying debt and as an expense element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and were not significant at december  and the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was a decrease of million in and an increase of million in operating profit decreased by approximately million in and improved by million in as a result of foreign currency translation 
stockholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts 
the impact of currency translation during was an increase in stockholders equity totaling million 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
pension costs amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension cost recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
for the year  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
for the historical long term investment periods of   and years ending december   our pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the percent rate used at december  
table of contents pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease total increase decrease to pension expense to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions from current assumptions discount rate rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
none of our reporting units with significant goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition  and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements accounting guidance adopted in the year ended december  business combinations in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to establish principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
guidance was also provided for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  during the second half of  we incurred accounting  legal  and other professional fees associated with the company s due diligence effort related to the huhtamaki oyj acquisition and the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
these costs were deferred in under the then existing accounting standards 
upon the adoption of this guidance on january   these costs were expensed 
we incurred additional costs during the year ended december  which were expensed 
the total 
table of contents impact to our earnings for the year ended december   as a result of this due diligence effort was a pretax charge of million  or a reduction in earnings per share of 
defined benefit retirement plan disclosures in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this guidance requires employers to disclose fair value measurements of plan assets  investment policies and strategies  and significant concentrations of risk 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years ending after december   and has expanded the disclosures related to our benefit plan assets 
earnings per share in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which clarified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and thus  must be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share 
as discussed in note  earnings per share computations  we adopted this guidance on january  the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for prior years presented has been recast to reflect this guidance 
the impact of this modification was a per share decrease in diluted earnings per share for each of the years ended december  and noncontrolling interests in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the guidance was adopted by the company on january  as required  the presentation of minority interest is now referred to as noncontrolling interest and repositioned in the consolidated financial statements 
in the consolidated statement of income  noncontrolling interest is now presented following a subtotal entitled net income 
in the consolidated balance sheet  noncontrolling interest is now presented as a component of total equity with a corresponding presentation in the consolidated statement of equity 
prior periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation in conformity with the requirements 
accounting guidance not yet adopted fair value measurements and disclosures in january  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance requires some new disclosures and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements 
the majority of the guidance is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  a portion of the guidance related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of level activity is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  this guidance will expand the company s disclosures and will not impact its financial position or results of operations
