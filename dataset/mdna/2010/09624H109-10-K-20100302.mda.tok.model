the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this form k contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by this forward looking information due to the factors discussed under risk factors  cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
as of january   we distributed more than  products to approximately  customers through our network of more than warehouses and third party operated warehouses which serve all major metropolitan markets in the united states 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
a number of factors cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of these factors are seasonal or cyclical in nature 
conditions in the united states housing market are at historically low levels and continued to deteriorate throughout fiscal our operating results have declined during the past three years as they are closely tied to us housing starts 
additionally  the mortgage markets have experienced substantial disruption due to a rising number of defaults in the subprime market 
this disruption and the related defaults have increased the inventory of homes for sale and also have caused lenders to tighten mortgage qualification criteria which further reduces demand for new homes 
forecasters continue to have a bearish outlook for the housing market  and we expect the downturn in new housing activity will continue to negatively impact our operating results for the foreseeable future 
we continue to prudently manage our inventories  receivables and spending in this environment 
however  along with many forecasters  we believe us housing demand will improve in the long term based on population demographics and a variety of other factors 
selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction 
we believe a substantial percentage of our sales are directly related to new home construction 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in product prices 
structural products prices can vary significantly based on short term and long term changes in supply and demand 
the prices of specialty products also can vary from time to time  although they generally are significantly less variable than structural products

new home construction has a significant impact on our sales 
specialty sales  primarily consisting of roofing  specialty panels  insulation  moulding  engineered wood products  vinyl siding  composite decking and metal products excluding rebar and remesh decreased by billion or compared to fiscal  due to a decrease in unit volume and a decrease in specialty product prices 
structural sales  including plywood  osb  lumber and metal rebar  decreased by billion  or from a year ago  as a result of a decrease in unit volume and decrease in structural product prices 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars compared to fiscal was driven primarily by a decrease in specialty and structural product volumes of and  respectively  due to the ongoing slowdown in the housing market 
gross margin percentage increased by basis points to primarily due to an increase in specialty sales as a proportion of our total sales  a shift in channel mix  and continued price discipline 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses included a million decrease in payroll and payroll related cost due to a decrease in headcount  a million decrease in fuel expense due to a decline in sales volume and fuel prices  a million gain associated with the sale of certain real properties  and a million decrease in other operating expenses as a result of the sales volume reduction that resulted in a corresponding reduction in variable costs 

table of contents net gain from terminating the georgia pacific supply agreement 
during fiscal  g p agreed to pay us million in exchange for our agreement to enter into the modification agreement one year earlier than the originally agreed upon may  termination date of the supply agreement 
as a result of the termination  we recognized a net gain of million during fiscal as a reduction to operating expense 
the gain was net of a million write off of an intangible asset associated with the supply agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the million decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily related to a decrease in capital expenditures as a result of decreased demand coupled with a portion of our property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during fiscal operating loss 
operating loss for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to an operating loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal  reflecting the million decline in gross profit that was offset by a million decrease in operating expenses 
interest expense  net

in fiscal  interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and mortgage was million and million includes a million prepayment penalty  respectively 
in addition  interest expense included million of debt issue cost amortization for fiscal and for fiscal  respectively 
changes associated with the ineffective interest rate swap  net 
changes associated with the ineffective interest rate swap recognized for fiscal were million and were comprised of a million charge related to the reduction of our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility below the interest rate swap s notional amount  million of amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss offset by income of million related to fair value changes since the date of the reduction at which time we were no longer in a position to use hedge accounting 
write off of debt issue costs 
during fiscal  we permanently reduced our revolving loan threshold limit from million to million effective march  as a result  we recorded expense of million for the write off of deferred financing costs that had been capitalized associated with the portion of the revolver that was reduced in the first quarter of fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the change in our effective tax rate for fiscal is largely due to a million valuation allowance charge and other income tax expense items partially offset by a million tax benefit related to current year losses that will be carried back to offset fiscal and income and a million allocation of tax expense to other comprehensive income resulting in a current period tax benefit

gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a decrease in specialty and structural product volumes of and  respectively  due to the continued decline in the housing market and a lower of cost or market reserve charge of million during fiscal related to a decline in prices for our structural metal inventory 
the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to an increase in certain structural metal prices earlier in the year and a shift in product mix from structural to higher margin specialty products 
additionally  we estimate that the stock keeping unit sku rationalization program  which was a program focused on the sale of slower moving inventory items  negatively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal structural gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal specialty gross margin increased to in fiscal from a year ago 
selling  general and administrative

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures for mobile equipment consisting of trucks  trailers  forklifts and automobiles 
operating loss

net loss for fiscal was million  compared to net loss of million for fiscal on a per share basis  basic and diluted loss applicable to common shareholders for fiscal were each 
basic and diluted loss per share for fiscal were each 
seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital and accounts receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season 
although  we generally expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future  we have reduced our inventory as part of our effort to manage to the current weakened demand environment in the housing market 
additionally  our accounts receivable balance has declined due to the weakened demand environment for the products we distribute 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures  dividends and acquisitions 
we believe that the amounts available from this and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the credit markets have recently experienced adverse conditions  which may adversely affect our lenders ability to fulfill their commitment under our revolving credit facility 
based on information available to us as of the filing date of this form k  we have no indications that the financial institutions included in our revolving credit facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments 
we may elect to selectively pursue acquisitions 
accordingly  depending on the nature of the acquisition  we may use cash or stock  or a combination of both  as acquisition currency 
our cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing acquisitions in the future 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors

we have reduced inventory levels to meet existing demand  and the reduction in our accounts receivable balance is due to an overall decline in the housing market related to sales volume 
the current asset reductions were offset by a reduction in the current portion of long term debt of million due to current year payments 
operating activities during fiscal  cash flows used in operating activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flow used in operations was a net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to a reduction in purchase volume associated with decreased demand resulting from market conditions 
these cash outflows were offset by a decrease in inventories of million to meet existing demand and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to an overall decline in the housing market related to sales volume 
during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flow from operations was a decrease in inventories of million to meet existing demand and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to an overall decline in the housing market related to sales volume 
these cash inflows were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million due to a reduction in purchase volume associated with decreased demand

investing activities during fiscal and fiscal  cash flows provided by investing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
during fiscal and fiscal  our expenditures for property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were used primarily to purchase computer equipment  leasehold improvements  and underground storage tanks 
we estimate that capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million is related to capital leases for new trucks 
our capital expenditures are anticipated to be paid from our operating cash 

table of contents proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment were million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  the proceeds of million included million related to the sale of certain real properties classified as held for sale assets included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets

the expenditures for property and equipment were primarily for mobile equipment 
proceeds from the disposition of property totaled million in fiscal the proceeds of million included million from an insurance settlement related to property damage from hurricane katrina 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal and million during fiscal the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected payments on our revolving credit facility of million  principal payments on our mortgage of million  and an increase in restricted cash related to our mortgage of million 
during fiscal  the net cash used in financing activities primarily reflected payments on our revolving credit facility of million  principal payments on our mortgage of million  prepayment fees associated with principal payments on our mortgage of million  and a decrease in bank overdrafts of million net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal net cash used in financing activities primarily reflected a net decrease in our revolving credit facility of million  a decrease in bank overdrafts of million  and common dividend payments of million 
debt and credit sources as of january   we had outstanding borrowings of million and excess availability of million under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
we classify the lowest projected balance of the credit facility over the next twelve months of million as long term debt 
as of january  and january   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  for the purposes of securing collateral requirements under our interest rate swap  insurance programs and for guaranteeing payment of international purchases based on the fulfillment of certain conditions 
our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants and restrictions for asset based loans 
the only covenant we deem material is a requirement that we maintain a fixed charge ratio of to in the event our excess availability falls below million 
the fixed charge ratio is calculated as ebitda over the sum of cash payments for income taxes  interest expense  cash dividends  principal payments on debt  and capital expenditures 
ebitda is defined in our credit agreement as bluelinx corporation s net income before interest and tax expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and other non cash charges 
the fixed charge ratio requirement only applies to us when excess availability under our revolving credit facility is less than million for three consecutive business days 
we had million and million of availability as january  and january   respectively 
our lowest level of availability in the last three years is million as of january  we do not anticipate our excess availability will drop below million in the foreseeable future 
under our revolving credit facility agreement  we are required to maintain a springing lock box arrangement where customer remittances go directly to a lock box maintained by our lenders and then are forwarded to our general bank accounts 
our outstanding borrowings are not reduced by these payments unless our excess availability is less than million for three consecutive business days or in the event of default 
due to this objective criteria established in our agreement  our revolving credit facility does not contain a subjective acceleration clause which would allow our lenders to accelerate the scheduled maturities of our debt or to cancel our agreement 

table of contents effective march   we elected to permanently reduce our revolving loan threshold limit from million to million 
this reduction does not impact our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility as our current eligible accounts receivable and inventory our borrowing base do not support up to million in borrowings 
we do not anticipate our borrowing base will support borrowings in excess of million at any point during the remaining life of the credit facility 
this cost saving initiative will allow us to reduce our interest expense by million annually by lowering our unused line fees 
as a result of this action  we recorded expense of million for the write off of deferred financing costs that had been capitalized 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with goldman sachs capital markets  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge 
through january   the hedge was highly effective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows 
fluctuations in the fair value of the ineffective portion  if any  of the cash flow hedge were reflected in earnings 
during fiscal  we reduced our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by million  which reduced outstanding debt below the interest rate swap s notional amount of million  at which point the hedge became ineffective in offsetting future changes in expected cash flows during the remaining term of the interest rate swap 
we used cash on hand to pay down this portion of our revolving credit debt during the first  second  and third quarters of fiscal as a result  changes in the fair value of the instrument were recorded through earnings from the point in time that the revolving credit facility balance was reduced below the interest rate swap s notional amount of million  which was during the first quarter of fiscal charges associated with the ineffective interest rate swap recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal were approximately million and are comprised of a non cash million pro rata reduction to accumulated other comprehensive loss with an offsetting charge to earnings related to reducing our borrowings outstanding by million  amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive loss over the life of the ineffective swap of million  and income of million related to fair value changes since the date of the reduction 
the remaining million of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized over the remaining month term of the interest rate swap and recorded as interest expense  of which million will be amortized over the next months 
any further reductions in borrowings under our revolving credit facility will result in a pro rata reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the payment date with a corresponding charge recorded to interest expense 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the unrealized losses related to our interest rate swap measured at fair value in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of january  in thousands balance at january  unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss charges associated with ineffective interest rate swap recorded to interest expense balance at january  the fair value of our swap liability at january  and january  was million and million  respectively

amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets to the extent entered into prior to the end of the applicable period as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity us generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves  inventory valuation  fair value measurements  impairment of long lived assets  and income taxes 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 

table of contents all revenues are recorded at gross 
the key indicators used to determine when and how revenue is recorded are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment and all other aspects of the customer relationship 
title passes to bluelinx  and we carry all risk of loss related to warehouse and reload inventory and inventory shipped directly from vendors to our customers 
we are responsible for all product returns 
we control the selling price for all channels 
we select the supplier 
we bear all credit risk 
in addition  we provide inventory to certain customers through pre arranged agreements on a consignment basis 
customer consigned inventory is maintained and stored by certain customers  however  ownership and risk of loss remains with us 
when the inventory is sold by the customer  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for each of the reported periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will ultimately be uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we include all charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventory to its existing condition and location 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged  excess and obsolete inventory 
the damaged  excess and obsolete reserve generally includes discontinued items or inventory that has turn days in excess of days  excluding new items during their product launch 

table of contents fair value measurements we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  which may affect our operating results and financial position 
when deemed appropriate  we minimize our risks from interest rate fluctuations through the use of an interest rate swap 
this derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the swap is valued using a valuation model that has inputs other than quoted market prices that are both observable and unobservable 
we endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
to determine fair value of the interest rate swap we used the discounted estimated future cash flows methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value in the period were i the present value factors used in determining fair value ii projected libor  and iii the risk of counterparty non performance risk 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management 
we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate swap is a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of this annual report on form k 
the level measurement is the risk of counterparty non performance on the interest rate swap liability that is not secured by cash collateral 
the affect of counterparty non performance is immaterial due to the fact that of the swap was covered by cash collateral 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate our long lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment 
indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses  management s decision to exit a facility  reductions in the fair market value of real properties and changes in other circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual distribution facility 
in the event of indicators of impairment  the assets of the distribution facility are evaluated by comparing the facility s undiscounted cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset  which ranges between years  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the estimated fair market value 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows is subject to assumptions that affect estimated operating income at a distribution facility level 
these assumptions are related to future sales  margin growth rates  economic conditions  market competition and inflation 
our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals and our experience with related market transactions 
we use a historical average of income  with no growth factor assumption  to estimate undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions used to determine impairment are considered to be level measurements in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of this annual report on form k 
currently  we are experiencing a reduction in operating income at the distribution facility level due to the ongoing downturn in the housing market 
to the extent that reductions in volume and operating income have resulted in impairment indicators  in most cases our carrying values continue to be less than our projected undiscounted cash flows 
we had approximately million  out of the million in net book value as of january   in fixed assets for which the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying values of the assets 
the fair value of these assets  primarily real estate  exceeded the carrying value by approximately million 
as such  we have not identified significant known trends impacting the fair value of long lived assets to an extent that would indicate impairment 

table of contents income taxes as of january   our deferred income tax assets were million with a full valuation allowance 
deferred income tax assets and income tax benefits are recognized for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets  we considered the four sources of taxable income that should be considered when determining whether a valuation allowance is required including from least to most subjective taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating and non operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
substantial changes in these assumptions could result in changes in our judgments around our ability to realize future tax benefit 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
this form k for the year ending january  and all subsequent public filings will reference the codification as the sole source of authoritative literature 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on subsequent events that establishes authoritative accounting and disclosure guidance for recognized and non recognized subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the guidance also requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this guidance was effective for us beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  and will be applied prospectively 
in april  the fasb issued guidance which will require that the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments be included in interim financial statements 
this guidance also requires entities to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments on an interim and annual basis and to highlight any changes from prior periods 
this guidance was effective for us during the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance on retirement benefits 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the enhanced disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with a greater understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made  including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level on changes in plan assets for the period  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this new guidance is applicable to employers that are subject to the disclosure requirements and is effective for fiscal years ending after december  for additional information  refer to note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on earnings per share 
under this new guidance  unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
this guidance was effective for us on january  and requires all presented prior period earnings per share data to be adjusted retrospectively
