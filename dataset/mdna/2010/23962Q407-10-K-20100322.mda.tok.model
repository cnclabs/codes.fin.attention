item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition 
you should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
this discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including those set forth in this annual report on form k 
overview we have developed a proprietary thin film deposition technology for solar photovoltaic pv products 
we utilize a proprietary one step sputter deposition process and have manufactured a commercial scale deposition tool to apply high efficiency copper indium gallium diselenide cigs material over large area glass substrates in a continuous fashion 
we intend to integrate this tool with commercially available thin film manufacturing equipment  which will provide us with a critically differentiated manufacturing process to produce low cost monolithically integrated  cigs on glass modules that address the grid tied  ground based pv market 
we believe this proprietary deposition process  when operated at an annual capacity of approximately megawatts  will enable us to achieve a total module manufacturing cost of less than per watt 
this cost would be competitive with the lowest in the solar pv industry 
using this approach  we have achieved greater than cell efficiencies over large areas on cigs pv devices  and we believe that this approach will enable us to reach module efficiencies greater than we have initiated construction of our first module production line 
to facilitate our entry into the addressable solar pv market  we have entered into a contract with blitzstrom gmbh  one of the world s leading thin film solar pv integrators  that commits blitzstrom to purchase a minimum of of our production through  subject to these products meeting defined performance criteria 
we have also signed a letter of intent with juwi solar  who is interested in purchasing up to of our production through in october  we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we have used these proceeds to develop our proprietary deposition process  to build our prototype and commercial scale deposition tools  and to begin installation of our first production line 
in the near term  we will require substantial funds beyond our current cash on hand in order to fully build out our first production line  to commence and support commercial production as currently planned  to fund future operations  and to expand our capacity beyond our first production line 
in order to raise the capital required for our next phase of growth  we have engaged a financial advisor to explore a possible rights offering to existing shareholders 
additionally  we have engaged a financial advisor to assist us in exploring select strategic transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those accounting policies can be found in the notes to our financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments on the part of management about matters that are uncertain 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using 
table of contents straight line and an accelerated method over estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs  which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment  are charged to operations as incurred 
when property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of  the property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation and any resulting gain or loss is recognized 
share based compensation 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
additionally  we follow the sec s sab no 
 share based payment sab  as amended by sab no 
 which provides supplemental application guidance based on the views of the sec 
derivative stock warrants 
certain terms in the convertible note and related documents issued and entered into on may   as well as subsequent agreements entered into on january   namely the potential for cash settlement require that the warrants issued in conjunction with these documents be treated as a derivative instrument and  therefore  classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
as such  the liability must be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period  and any changes in fair value reported as a gain or loss on derivative liabilities in our statement of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the warrant fair values 
upon a change in control of our company  warrant holders having the right to purchase  shares of common stock would have the right to require us to repurchase the warrants from them at a purchase price equal to the black scholes value of the unexercised portion of the warrants 
generally  this accounting treatment will result in a reported loss during any accounting period in which there is a reported increase in the sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
conversely  this accounting treatment generally will result in a reported gain during any accounting period in which there is reported decrease in the sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and certain reclassifications have been made to the financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no impact on net loss 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily due to the cost savings measures implemented in including a reduction in our workforce as well as a reduction in expenditures for materials  supplies and consultants 
during  we prioritized our development efforts to focus on our core cigs technology and related development in order continue to advance our product toward commercialization while we seek additional financing to complete the build out of our initial production line 
also  in july  we sold substantially all our tangible assets at our halfmoon  ny facility to veeco compound semiconductor  inc veeco for million and veeco hired the research and development employees located at the facility 
this transaction further reduced our research and development expenses during the latter half of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost savings measures implemented during including a reduction in our workforce as well as a reduction in outside consultants and professional fees 
additionally  there was a decrease of  in share based compensation for selling  general and administrative personnel during as compared to depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to an increase in equipment 
table of contents utilized in the development of our cigs pv products and manufacturing processes at the end of and beginning of this increase was offset by a reduction in expense due to the sale of the fixed assets at our halfmoon  ny facility in july the overall increase in property and equipment on our balance sheet during the period was due primarily to the acquisition of and initial costs incurred for certain equipment required for the construction of our initial manufacturing line 
these items are classified as construction in progress until they are placed in service and therefore have no current impact on depreciation expense 
other expense income 
other expense was  for the year ended december  compared to other income of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  other loss in primarily represents the loss on the company s sale of assets to veeco in july  and the other income in primarily represents interest on investments  which are classified as cash equivalents  generated from the net proceeds of our follow on public offering in october interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the recording of a full year of interest on tenant improvements financed by the landlord in our newark  ca facility as well as interest on notes issued during the latter part of amortization of note discount and financing costs 
amortization of note discount and financing costs was  for the year ended december  there was no amortization of note discount and financing costs during the year ended december  the expense in primarily represents the amortization of the discount on a million convertible note entered into in september gain on derivative liabilities 
gain on derivative liabilities was  for the year ended december  compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  the warrants issued in may and early in conjunction with a convertible note  as well as a conversion feature on a convertible note issued in september are considered derivative liabilities and are therefore required to be adjusted to fair value each quarter 
a decrease in our stock price during the period results in a decrease in the liabilities and a gain on derivative liabilities 
conversely  an increase in our stock price during the period would result in an increase in the liabilities and a loss on derivative liabilities 
during the year ended december   our common stock price decreased which caused a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability and conversion feature  resulting in a gain on derivative liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash was primarily due to the payment of operating expenses  payment for certain equipment on order for our initial production line  as well as leasehold improvements completed in our initial manufacturing facility in newark  california 
subsequent to december  and through march   we have received additional bridge financing of million to fund our continued product development and operations 
we are in the development stage  and as such  have historically reported net losses  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  we anticipate incurring losses in the future  as we complete the build out of our initial production line and enter commercialization of our products  invest in research and development  and incur associated administrative and operating costs 
our financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
as noted herein  as a result of our current liquidity  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have historically financed our operations primarily from proceeds of the sale of equity securities 
we presently do not have any bank lines of credit that provide us with an additional source of debt financing 
in order to fund the costs associated with our continued development and commercialization efforts  we completed a 
table of contents registered public offering during the fourth quarter of in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share and generated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and the fees and expenses of the offering 
upon receipt of the proceeds from the offering  we re paid in full million of existing indebtedness 
we have used these proceeds to develop our proprietary deposition process  to build our prototype and commercial scale deposition tools  and to begin installation of our first production line 
commercialization efforts  including the completion and ramp up of our initial production line will require significant additional capital expenditures as well as associated continued development and administrative costs 
during and  we achieved several key milestones as we completed the development of our proprietary one step sputter deposition process  built our prototype and commercial scale deposition tools  completed our first full size x monolithically integrated cigs on glass modules and continued to enhance the performance of such modules  and began installation of our first production line 
in order to continue operations and build out our initial production line and commence commercial shipments of our product  we will require substantial funds in the near term beyond our current cash on hand 
in light of our current cash position  we implemented a significant reduction in our workforce in and other cost savings measures in order to preserve cash 
on july   we sold substantially all of our tangible assets located at our halfmoon  new york facilities to veeco compound semiconductor  inc veeco for million 
upon completion of this transaction  veeco employed all of our employees located in halfmoon which reduced our payroll and related costs  and assumed responsibility for the facilities and operating costs associated with the facilities which further reduced our overall operating expenses 
we have retained ownership of the intellectual property developed in new york for future use in either glass or flexible substrate pv modules 
the transaction also allows us to continue our efforts on our proprietary reactive sputter process currently in use to produce cigs on glass photovoltaic modules without diminishing opportunities to re enter flexible pv module markets when business  technology  and market conditions favor such a product 
on september   we entered into a letter of intent with epod solar inc epod canada the loi 
the loi contemplated a series of transactions resulting in the combination of daystar and epod canada 
after initial discussions  on october   our board of directors accepted epod canada s notification to terminate the loi 
on september   we entered into a series of agreements with mr 
peter alan lacey in which mr 
lacey provided us million in bridge financing in exchange for a secured convertible promissory note and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
in december  mr 
lacey provided us with additional bridge financing of  subsequent to december  and through march   we have received additional bridge financing of million to fund our operations 
in order to address our immediate financial needs  we intend to pursue a rights offering to existing shareholders  in which our shareholders would have the opportunity to purchase additional common shares based on their pro rata ownership percentage 
a successful rights offering would raise the capital required to improve our current financial condition while giving existing shareholders the opportunity to limit ownership dilution  the exact size  timing  terms and conditions of the rights offering have not yet been determined by the board of directors and there is no guarantee that we will complete a rights offering 
additionally  we have engaged a financial advisor to seek long term strategic investments and partnerships 
to date  we have been unable to raise substantial additional capital or complete an agreement with an investor or strategic partner 
although we continue to seek strategic investors or partners  in light of our current cash position  we may in the near term be forced to cease or substantially curtail operations 
an inability to raise additional funding in the very near term may cause us to file a voluntary petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code  liquidate assets  and or pursue other such actions that could adversely affect future operations 
a wide variety of factors relating to the company including those 
table of contents described in the section entitled risk factors in part i item a in our annual report on form k and section a of part ii of this report  as well as external conditions  could adversely affect our ability to secure additional funding necessary to continue operations and the terms of any funding that we secure 
commitments 
at december   we had outstanding approximately million of purchase orders for equipment and improvements 
other material commitments include rental payments under operating leases for office space and equipment  and commitments under employment contracts with our executive officers 
these commitments are discussed further in the commitments and contingencies footnote to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the only off balance sheet obligations are for operating leases and certain other commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we lease  square feet of factory and office space in santa clara  california under a lease which expires in march this facility is the location of our corporate headquarters as well as the development of our products and proprietary deposition equipment 
we also lease approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space in newark  california 
the lease commenced on september  and the initial term of the lease expires on september  we have two options to extend the lease by five years each at the completion of the initial term 
this facility is the primary location for our initial manufacturing line 
see item legal proceedings for a description of the current leasing arrangement for the newark facility 
as discussed under commitments  at december   we had approximately million in commitments under outstanding purchase orders for equipment and improvements 
such commitments are primarily related to manufacturing equipment which we expect to be delivered throughout generally we are required to remit any balances due to the suppliers upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment
