item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
any discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview surmodics is a leading provider of drug delivery and surface modification technologies to the healthcare industry 
in march we announced a change in our operational structure to better align functional expertise  which resulted in the elimination of the company s business units 
the organizational change did not diminish the company s continued market focus 
the therapeutic market includes revenue from cardiovascular  which provides drug delivery and surface modification technologies to customers in the cardiovascular market  ophthalmology  which is focused on the advancement of treatments for eye diseases  such as age related macular degeneration amd and diabetic macular edema dme  two of the leading causes of blindness  and other markets  which is focused on a variety of clinical markets principally in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
the diagnostic market includes revenue from the company s microarray slide technologies  our stabilization products  antigens and substrates for immunoassay diagnostic tests  and our in vitro diagnostic format technology 
in october  we announced initiatives intended to reduce our cost structure 
as part of these initiatives  the company implemented a change in its organizational structure to reflect our three complementary  but distinct business units medical device  pharmaceuticals  and in vitro diagnostics 
because this change occurred in fiscal and is therefore not useful in explaining our fiscal results  we will describe our business below as it was conducted in fiscal beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we will describe our business under the new reporting structure 

table of contents our revenue is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our proprietary drug delivery and surface modification technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of polymers and reagent chemicals  stabilization products  antigens  substrates and microarray slides to the diagnostics and biomedical research industry  and research and development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of licensed products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to customers  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we report our results in one reportable segment 
we made this determination because we manage our sales and marketing efforts and our expenses on a company wide basis 
in addition  a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to a variety of customers  and our technologies and products are marketed to the same or similar customers 
in june  we entered into a license and research collaboration agreement and separate supply agreement with merck co  inc merck related to our i vation tm ta triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 
under the terms of the merck agreements  we received an upfront license fee of million and were eligible to receive up to an additional million in fees and development milestones associated with the successful product development and attainment of appropriate us and eu regulatory approvals  as well as payment for our research and development activities 
in september  following a strategic review of its business and product development portfolio  merck gave notice that it was terminating the collaborative research and license agreement  as well as the supply agreement entered into in june this decision was not based on any concerns about the safety or efficacy of the i vation system 
the termination was effective in december  and we have recognized revenue related to the termination of approximately million in fiscal  principally from amounts that previously had been deferred and amortized under the accounting treatment required by accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the million includes a million milestone payment associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
in november  we acquired a portfolio of intellectual property and collaborative drug delivery projects from pr pharmaceuticals  inc  a drug delivery company specializing in injectable  biodegradable sustained release formulations 
total consideration paid through september  was million and pr pharmaceuticals  inc is eligible to receive up to an additional million in cash upon successful achievement of specified milestones 
the proprietary technologies we acquired complement and enhance our existing portfolio of drug delivery capabilities by providing a broader toolkit for protein delivery and the ability to use smaller gauge needles for microparticle injections 
on october   we entered into a license and development agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd 
roche and genentech  inc  a member of the roche group genentech 
under the terms of the license agreement  roche and genentech will have an exclusive license to develop and commercialize a sustained drug delivery formulation of lucentis ranibizumab injection utilizing surmodics proprietary biodegradable microparticles drug delivery system 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront licensing fee of million and are eligible to receive potential payments of up to approximately million in fees and milestone payments in the event of the successful development and commercialization of multiple products  as well as payment for development work done on these products 
roche and genentech will have the right to obtain manufacturing services from surmodics 
in the event a commercial product is developed  we will also receive royalties on sales of such product 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements is based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with accounting guidance  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or delivery has occurred if the terms specify destination  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
however  when there are additional performance requirements  revenue is recognized when such requirements have been satisfied 
the company licenses technology to third parties and collects royalties 
royalty revenue is generated when a customer sells products incorporating the company s licensed technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with a quarterly report 
this revenue recognition model is similar to usage fee accounting 
minimum royalty fees are recognized in the period earned  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
for stand alone license agreements  up front license fees are recognized over the economic life of the technology 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon achievement of the milestone and meeting specific revenue recognition criteria 
product sales to third parties are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that an order has been received  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our sales terms provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty policy 
payment terms are generally set at days 
generally  revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables have been accounted for based on accounting guidance in existence at the time the arrangement commences 
prior to october   arrangements such as license and development agreements were analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and development  could be separated  or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with accounting guidance 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately 
if the license was considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  and the license payments and payments for performance obligations would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed  or the economic life of the technology licensed to the customer 
when we determined that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we recognized the related revenue on a time based accounting model 
the company had one significant multiple element arrangement prior to october  that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting resulting in deferral and recognition of all related payments received for license and research and development activities using a time based model 
this arrangement was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal in october  the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements were amended to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal  on a prospective basis  for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after october  in connection with the adoption of the amended accounting standard we also changed our policy prospectively 
table of contents for multiple element arrangements  whereby we account for revenue using a multiple attribution model in which consideration allocated to research and development activities is recognized as performed  and milestone payments are recognized when the milestone events are achieved  when such activities and milestones are deemed substantive 
accordingly  in situations where a unit of accounting includes both a license and research and development activities  and when a license does not have stand alone value  the company applies a multiple attribution model in which consideration allocated to the license is recognized ratably  consideration allocated to research and development activities is recognized as performed and milestone payments are recognized when the milestone events are achieved  when such activities and milestones are deemed substantive 
the company enters into license and development arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables which could include a license s to surmodics technology  research and development activities  manufacturing services  and product sales based on the needs of its customers 
for example  a customer may enter into an arrangement to obtain a license to surmodics intellectual property which may also include research and development activities  and supply of products manufactured by surmodics 
for these services provided  surmodics could receive upfront license fees upon signing of an agreement and granting the license  fees for research and development activities as such activities are performed  milestone payments contingent upon advancement of the product through development and clinical stages to successful commercialization  fees for manufacturing services and supply of product  and royalty payments based on customer sales of product incorporating surmodics technology 
our license and development arrangements generally do not have refund provisions if the customer cancels or terminates the agreement 
typically all payments made are non refundable 
we evaluate each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement for separability 
we are then required to allocate revenue to each separate deliverable using a hierarchy of vsoe  tpe  or esp 
in certain instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements which may be a result of surmodics infrequently selling each element separately 
when vsoe cannot be established  surmodics establishes a selling price of each element based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which surmodics would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
esp is generally used for highly customized offerings 
surmodics determines esp for undelivered elements by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  market conditions  competitive landscape and past pricing arrangements with similar characteristics 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized except for services related to the merck agreement  which have been recognized as incurred 
customer advances are accounted for as a liability until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
valuation of long lived assets 
accounting guidance requires us to periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangibles 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value were less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge 
in fiscal  we recognized asset impairment charges totaling million 
we wrote down facility related assets in alabama by million to their fair value based on a decision to sell the assets  however based on further analysis of various factors associated with the consolidation of facilities we later decided not to sell the facility 
the carrying value of the facility is million at september   which is based on a real estate appraisal obtained during our negotiations 
we also wrote down certain project and technology related assets totaling million  as there were very limited business opportunities expected in light of current market conditions and general economic environment 
surmodics also incurred a charge of million associated with certain fixed assets in minnesota given the current level of business activity and overall economic conditions 
each of these events included analysis of expected future cash flows or real estate market data which was compared to the carrying values of the assets to 
table of contents determine the impairment charges that were recognized 
the assets associated with these charges had limited remaining value and as such were written down to zero value at september  goodwill 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value as required by accounting guidance for business combinations 
the initial recognition of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
we have determined that our reporting units are our surmodics pharmaceuticals  inc surmodics pharma subsidiary  the in vitro diagnostics operations and the surmodics drug delivery and hydrophilic coatings operations 
the company reorganized in march which resulted in the elimination of the company s business units 
the reporting units with goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of surmodics pharma and biofx laboratories  inc in fiscal inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which represented a full impairment of the goodwill associated with our surmodics pharma reporting unit 
prior to testing goodwill for impairment we tested our definite lived assets  property  plant and equipment as well as intangible assets  under the provisions of the accounting guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and determined that there were no impairments of these assets 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges during fiscal or the goodwill impairment in fiscal reflected a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units  which resulted from a slowdown in business activity which was most pronounced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  higher operating costs with our recently placed in service cgmp manufacturing facility  and a significant decrease in our stock price during the year 
our stock price declined from per share at october  to per share at the date of our annual impairment test  which was august  while we continually evaluate whether any indications of impairment are present that would require an impairment analysis on an interim basis  no such indicators were considered present prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to the fourth quarter  based on our outlook for future results and the fact that our market capitalization exceeded our book value by a margin of at june   we did not believe that the events and circumstances in existence at our interim reporting dates indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying values step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value  with the market approach used as a test of reasonableness 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold 
the income approach is tailored to the circumstances of our business  and the market approach is completed as a secondary test to ensure that the results of the income approach are reasonable and in line with comparable companies in the industry 
the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  
table of contents the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our surmodics pharma reporting unit under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis used forecasts over a ten year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the most significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the most recent goodwill impairment tests included annual revenue changes based on current customer programs and expected progression of programs into different phases of development 
a discount rate of percent was used in the analysis to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for this reporting unit 
given the significant difference between the reporting unit s fair value and carrying value  any change in the discount rate would not have changed the evaluation of impairment 
in estimating the fair value of our company under the market approach  we considered the relative merits of commonly applied market capitalization multiples based on the availability of data 
based on our analysis  we utilized the guideline public company method to support the valuation of the reporting units 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of august   the million of goodwill in the surmodics pharma reporting unit failed step of the impairment test  and step of the impairment test indicated that goodwill was fully impaired 
we also anticipate that this reporting unit may achieve additional milestone obligations of million in fiscal and we may record a goodwill impairment charge for this amount in fiscal the indicated excess in fair value over carrying value of the company s in vitro diagnostics reporting unit in step of the impairment test at august  was approximately and as such the million of goodwill related to this reporting unit is not impaired 
to the extent that actual results or other assumptions about future economic conditions or potential for our growth and profitability in this business changes  it is possible that our conclusion regarding the goodwill could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the surmodics drug delivery and hydrophilic coatings operations does not have any goodwill and was included in the analysis to assist in reconciling the fair value of all reporting units to the company s market capitalization at august  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities and are classified as available for sale or held to maturity at september  our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
our evaluation of the available for sale investments resulted in no loss recognition in fiscal and investments for which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
if there was an other than temporary impairment in the fair value of any individual security classified as held to maturity  the company would write down the security to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other income loss 
interest on debt securities  including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  is included in other income loss 
realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities  which are included in other income loss  are determined using the specific identification method 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income tax obligations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in 
table of contents our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years  for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we had total deferred tax assets in excess of total deferred tax liabilities of million as of september  and  including valuation allowances of million as of september  and million as of september  the valuation allowances related to impairment losses on investments were recorded because the company does not currently foresee future capital gains within the allowable carry forward and carry back periods to offset these capital losses when they are recognized 
as such  no tax benefit has been recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we recorded a valuation allowance related to state net operating losses based on the uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating losses in the carryforward periods 
the company adopted accounting provisions on october  which defined new standards for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of september   and was million  million and million  respectively  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
of these unrecognized tax benefits  million  million and million would affect our effective tax rate for fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of september   and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest and penalties were accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
the internal revenue service has commenced an examination of our united states income tax return for fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal years and remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities 
tax returns for state and local jurisdictions for fiscal years through remain subject to examination by state and local tax authorities 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or local jurisdiction  all years remain subject to examination by the tax authorities 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly

table of contents results of operations years ended september  and fiscal fiscal increase dollars in thousands decrease change revenue therapeutic cardiovascular ophthalmology other markets total therapeutic diagnostic total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the decreases in therapeutic and diagnostic revenue  as detailed in the table above  are further explained in the narrative below 
therapeutic 
revenue in therapeutic was million in fiscal  a decrease compared with million in the prior year period 
the decrease in total revenue principally reflects the recognition in fiscal of revenue of approximately million associated with the merck collaborative research and license agreement  which was terminated effective in the first quarter of fiscal excluding this significant event specific item in fiscal  therapeutic revenue decreased million  or 
cardiovascular derives a substantial amount of revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
the cypher stent faces continuing competition from boston scientific  medtronic  and abbott laboratories 
stents from these companies compete directly with the cypher stent both domestically and internationally 
for the last several years  royalty and reagent product sales have decreased due to lower cypher stent sales 
we anticipate that royalty revenue from the cypher stent are likely to descrease in fiscal and beyond as the various marketers of drug eluting stents compete  and as others enter the marketplace 
we also receive a royalty on sales of delivery systems used to deliver the medtronic endeavor and endeavor resolute drug eluting stents 
these stent delivery systems incorporate our proprietary hydrophilic technology and are sold in the united states and internationally 
cardiovascular revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year principally as a result of higher license fees which included recognition of fees of million associated with a terminated agreement  and higher reagent product sales  partially offset by lower research and development revenue 
cordis cypher stent sales decreased approximately during fiscal which resulted in lower royalty revenue from this agreement 
ophthalmology revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year 
the significant decrease relates to the recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with the terminated collaborative research and license agreement with merck in fiscal in september  following a strategic review of merck s business and product development portfolio  merck gave notice that it was terminating the collaborative research and license agreement as well as the supply agreement entered into in june the termination became effective in december we recognized the revenue previously deferred totaling million  and we received and recognized a million milestone payment from merck associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 

table of contents ophthalmology revenue  when excluding the merck event specific items of fiscal  increased by million  or  principally as a result of a license fee milestone event 
other markets revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period 
lower research and development revenue was the primary reason for the decrease 
fiscal  like fiscal  continued to see selected customers delay  slow or cancel development projects as a result of various factors  including current economic conditions  financing challenges  and issues in the pharmaceutical industry 
other markets revenue is derived from more than customers 
diagnostic 
diagnostic revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in the prior year period 
the decrease was attributable to lower royalties and license fees in fiscal in past years  diagnostic derived a significant percentage of revenue from abbott laboratories 
royalty revenue from our diagnostic format patent license agreement with abbott was million in fiscal there was no royalty revenue from abbott in fiscal because the patents had expired 
in addition to the lower royalties and license fees  product sales decreased less than compared with fiscal as customers continued to be cautious with their purchasing activity 
we anticipate modest growth in product sales for fiscal product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with in the prior year 
the decrease in product margins reflected the mix of products sold in fiscal  as there were higher polymer product sales  which products carry lower margins than our reagent and diagnostic products 
there was an inventory impairment charge totaling million recognized in fiscal the gross margin  when adjusting for this impairment  was 
customer research and development expenses 
customer research and development customer r d expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the impact of higher fixed costs attributable to our alabama research and development operations 
customer r d margins were negative  compared with in fiscal fiscal margins were after adjusting for merck deferred revenue recognition and final billings 
the increase in fiscal costs reflects the higher fixed overhead costs in alabama as well as increased material costs 
we anticipate fiscal costs associated with our cgmp facility to increase because of maintenance and validation activities 
other research and development expenses 
other research and development other r d expenses were million  a decrease of compared with fiscal overhead costs allocated to other r d decreased compared with fiscal  and our research and development headcount decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of our march reorganization and attrition  resulting in lower labor costs 
these reductions were partially offset by higher project material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects higher professional services fees  higher bad debt expenses and additional operating costs with our alabama facilities that are allocated to sg a  partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense and lower sg a headcount 
restructuring charges 
in march  we announced an organizational change designed to support future growth by better meeting customer needs  leveraging our multiple competencies across the organization  and building on our pharmaceutical industry experience 
we eliminated approximately of our workforce with the terminations occurring across various functions 
surmodics recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million in connection with the reorganization  consisting of million associated with severance pay and benefits expenses and million of facility related costs 
surmodics vacated and subleased its leased office facility in irvine  california and a warehouse in birmingham  alabama 
in november  we announced a functional reorganization which resulted in elimination of approximately of our workforce 
these employee terminations occurred across various functions  and the reorganization plan was completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the reorganization also resulted in surmodics vacating a leased office facility in eden prairie  minnesota  and consolidating into our owned office and research facility also in eden prairie 
we recorded total restructuring charges of million in connection with this reorganization 
these pre tax charges consisted of million of severance pay and benefits expenses and million of facility related costs 

table of contents costs totaling million have been paid associated with both restructurings  and we anticipate paying the remaining million within the next three years  with the majority in the next twelve months 
we also announced an additional restructuring subsequent to fiscal which resulted in a reduction to our cost structure and renewed focus on business units 
this change resulted in the elimination of approximately of our workforce with anticipated restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal in the range of million to million 
asset impairment charges 
in fiscal  we recorded a million asset impairment charge associated with writing down one of our facilities in alabama to fair value based on a decision to sell the facility  which we later determined not to sell 
the million carrying value of this facility is based on a real estate market appraisal obtained during our negotiations 
we also recorded a million asset impairment charge associated with certain long lived assets where very limited business is expected in the near term based on current market conditions 
furthermore  a million asset impairment charge associated with certain fixed asset costs located in minnesota and a million asset impairment charge associated with prototypes and other equipment related to a development project for which very limited use is expected in the near term in light of current market conditions 
the assets associated with these charges had limited remaining value and as such were written down to zero value 
goodwill impairment charge 
in fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge associated with our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal reflected a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units  mainly our surmodics pharmaceuticals reporting unit  which resulted from a slowdown in business activity most pronounced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  higher operating costs with our recently placed in service cgmp manufacturing facility  and a significant decrease in our stock price during the year 
our stock price declined from per share at october  to per share at the date of our annual impairment test  which was august  we continually evaluate whether any indications of impairment are present that would require an impairment analysis on an interim basis 
prior to the fourth quarter  based on our outlook for future results and the fact that our market capitalization exceeded our book value by a margin of at june   we did not believe that the events and circumstances in existence at our interim reporting dates indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount 
other income loss  net 
other loss was million in fiscal  compared with income of million in fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower yields generated from our investment portfolio in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a total of million of impairment losses in connection with our portfolio of strategic investments 
we recognized an impairment loss on our investment in nexeon medsystems totaling million in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the valuations associated with potential new rounds of financing 
in addition  we recognized a million loss on our investment in a medical technology company in the third quarter of fiscal based on market valuations and a pending financing round for this company 
another entity in which the company had a strategic investment sold the majority of its assets in the third quarter of fiscal resulting in an impairment loss of million 
income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal is not meaningful because a tax expense was recorded on a pretax loss 
the effective tax rate  when excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of million and impairment losses on investments of million was since surmodics does not currently foresee offsetting capital gains that could offset these capital losses  and therefore no benefit has been recorded 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
the increase in the effective tax rate  adjusted for the one time items noted  is primarily a 
table of contents result of non deductible stock based compensation expenses  offset partially by lower state taxes resulting from adjustments to state deferred taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest 
table of contents rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale and held to maturity securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
