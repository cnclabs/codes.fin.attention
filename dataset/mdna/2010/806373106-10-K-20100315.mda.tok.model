executive overview marketing  promotional and advertising spending by consumer products companies and retailers drives a majority of the company s revenues 
the markets served are primarily consumer products  pharmaceutical  entertainment and retail 
the company s business in this area involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  the company or a third party creates an image and then the image is manipulated to enhance the color and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including freestanding inserts fsi s  magazine ads and the internet 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image strategic analysis planning and messaging conceptual design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the company s involvement in a client project may involve many of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  such changes equal new revenue for schawk 
the company is paid for its graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of the company s revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes occur with regular frequency and lack of notice  and client turn around requirements are tight  thereby creating little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for the company  such as valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
additionally  changing regulatory requirements necessitate new packaging and a high degree of documentation 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
through several acquisitions  the company has increased the percentage of its revenue derived from providing graphics services to advertising and retail clients and added to its service offering graphic services to the entertainment market 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented premedia graphic services 
graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
in  approximately percent of the company s total revenues came from its largest single client 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to the client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in the company business relationship with any of its principal clients could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent acquisitions the company has grown its business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
schawk has completed approximately acquisitions since the company s recent acquisitions have significantly expanded its service offerings and its geographic presence  making us the only independent premedia firm with substantial operations in north america  europe  asia and australia 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company is able to offer a broader range of services to its clients 
its expanded geographic presence also allows us to better serve its multinational clients demands for global brand consistency

the company may  at its option and subject to certain conditions  increase the amount of the facility by up to million by obtaining one or more new commitments from new or existing lenders to fund such increase 
immediately following the closing of the facility  there was approximately million in outstanding borrowings 
loans under the facility generally bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin that varies with the company s cash flow leverage ratio  in addition to applicable commitment fees  with a maximum rate of libor plus basis points 
loans under the facility are not subject to a minimum libor floor 
at closing  the applicable margin was basis points  resulting in an interest rate at closing of percent 
borrowings under the facility will be used for general corporate purposes  such as working capital and capital expenditures 
additionally  together with anticipated cash generated from operations  the unutilized portion of the credit facility is expected to be available to provide financing flexibility and support in the funding of principal payments due in and succeeding years on the company s other long term debt obligations 
outstanding obligations due under the facility continue to be secured through security interests in and liens on substantially all of the company s and its domestic subsidiaries current and future personal property and on percent of the capital stock of the company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and percent of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default

the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  concurrently with its entry into the credit agreement  the company also amended the note purchase agreements underlying its outstanding senior notes in order to conform the financial and other covenants contained in the note purchase agreements to the covenants contained in the credit agreement described above 
management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the company s liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future  and that the company has sufficient resources to support its operations  either through currently available cash and cash generated from future operations  or pursuant to its renegotiated credit facility 
the company s ability to realize its near term business objectives is subject to  among other things  its ability to remain in compliance with its covenants under its debt arrangements 
based on its business plan  which contains a number of assumptions related to economic trends and the company s business and operations  the company presently expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future  however compliance in and thereafter remains subject to many variables  including those described under risk factors contained in this report 
the company operates in thirteen countries besides the united states 
the company currently believes that there are no political  economic or currency restrictions that materially limit the company s flexibility in managing its global cash resources 
seasonality with the acquisitions of winnetts and seven  the seasonal fluctuations in business on a combined basis generally result in lower revenues in the first quarter as compared to the other quarters of the year ended december off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
cash flows from its historically profitable operations have permitted the company to re invest in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions of complementary businesses 
over the next five years  assuming no significant business acquisitions  capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of to million annually 
during the next three years  the company expects to incur capital investment and related costs in information technology systems to improve customer service  business effectiveness and internal controls  as well as to reduce operating costs 
also  over the next five years  the company s two and a half year revolving credit facility and all of its long term private placement debt matures 
the company s total contractual obligations over the next five years total approximately million  including all debt obligations see contractual obligation table below 
at this time  the company believes that cash flow from operations and its ability to refinance its maturing debt obligations will be sufficient to finance the company during the next five years  assuming no significant business acquisitions 
if a significant acquisition is undertaken in the next five years  the company would likely need to access the debt and equity markets to finance such an acquisition 
the following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt  lease and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands debt obligations interest on debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation multiemployer pension withdrawal uncertain tax positions total reflects scheduled interest payments on fixed rate debt 
variable rate interest on approximately  of variable rate debt under its revolving credit agreement as of december  is excluded because regular interest payments are not scheduled and fluctuate depending on outstanding principal balance and market rate interest levels 
as of december   the company s total liability for uncertain tax positions was  including  of accrued interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  the company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
purchase obligations resulting from purchase orders entered in the normal course of business are not significant 
the company s major manufacturing cost is employees labor 
the company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations  together with general company financing transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following are the most critical accounting estimates that could have an effect on schawk s reported results 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  advertising agencies  retailers  both grocery and non grocery  and entertainment companies 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to schawk from its normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its accounts receivable  the company estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on the aging of its outstanding receivables  its historical write off experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos of million was established at december   compared to an allowance of million at december  a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry  a loss of a major customer or several customers  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset 
the company s cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect its best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
the company s estimates of fair value represent its best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  principally for land and buildings where the carrying values could not be supported by current appraised market values and reflected this expense as impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations at december  a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  resulting in future additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill  customer relationships and  to a lesser extent  other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of  or a significant decrease in volume from  a major customer  a change in the expected useful life of an asset  a change in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer 
when a potential impairment condition has been identified  an impairment test of the intangible asset is performed  based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
during  the company recorded an impairment write down of million for a customer relationship intangible asset for which it was determined that future estimated cash flows did not support the carrying value 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company did not identify any other events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment condition existed at december   with respect to its intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company historically performed its annual impairment test as of december  however  in the fourth quarter of the company changed its annual test date to october in the third quarter of  the company restructured its operations on a geographic basis  in three areas north america  europe and asia pacific see note segment and geographic reporting 
the company allocated goodwill to the new segments on a relative fair value basis and relied on the goodwill impairment analysis performed as of june   which indicated no impairment of the assigned goodwill 
the company performed its goodwill impairment test as of october  the company assigned its goodwill to multiple reporting units on a geographic basis at the operating segment level in accordance with the segment reporting topic of the codification  asc using projections of operating cash flow for each reporting unit  the company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the step one impairment analysis indicated no potential impairment of the assigned goodwill 
because of a significant decrease in the company s market capitalization during the first quarter of  the company performed an additional goodwill impairment test as of march  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the company performed its impairment test as of october  in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification  asc  the company assigned its goodwill to multiple reporting units  mainly on a geographic basis at a level below the operating segments 
the test indicated that goodwill assigned to the company s european and anthem reporting units was impaired by million and million  respectively  as of october   which was recorded in the fourth quarter of with the segment reorganization in the third quarter of  the impairment of goodwill was reassigned to the new segments as follows north america million  europe million and asia pacific million 
the goodwill impairment reflected the decline in global economic conditions and general reduction in consumer and business confidence experienced during the fourth quarter of the estimates and assumptions used by the company to test its goodwill are consistent with the business plans and estimates used to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions could impact whether an impairment charge is required and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
if the company fails to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experiences unfavorable market conditions or achieves results that differ from its estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may be required to recognize impairment charges 
additionally  future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary if the company s market capitalization decreases due to a decline in the trading price of the company s common stock 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
federal  state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit schawk  like other multi national companies  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of income taxes topic of the codification  asc  that contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily arising from the acquisition of seven in  due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill 
any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income 
during  the company recorded a reduction to its exit reserves for the benchmark acquisition in the amount of million as a credit to goodwill and an increase to its exit reserves for seven and winnetts for million as a charge to income  primarily due to changes in sublease assumptions at the vacated facilities 
at december   the company had exit reserves of approximately million that were included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  for exit activities completed in and  primarily for facility closure costs 
future increases or decreases in these reserves are possible  as the company continues to assess changes in circumstance that would alter the future cost assumptions used in the calculation of the reserves 
however  the company believes that  because the current exit reserves are diminishing  any further changes to the exit reserves would be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards codification asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
the accounting changes summarized in asu and asu are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of asu and asu may have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a final statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
to establish the fasb accounting standards codification tm also referred to as codification or asc as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the asc is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the asc did not change gaap but reorganized existing us accounting and reporting standards issued by the fasb and other related private sector standard setters 
the company began to reference the asc when referring to gaap in its financial statements starting with the third quarter of additionally  because the asc does not change gaap  the company references the applicable asc section for all periods presented including periods before the authoritative release of asc  except for the grandfathered guidance not included in the codification 
the change to asc did not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued accounting guidance regarding subsequent events 
this guidance  found under the subsequent events topic of the codification  asc  and effective for interim or annual periods ending after june   establishes general standards of accounting for disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
the company adopted this guidance as of june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb amended the accounting standards codification as summarized in accounting standards update no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
the amendments in the asu remove the requirement for a securities and exchange commission filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new guidance regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
this new guidance  found under the business combinations identifiable assets and liabilities  and any noncontrolling interest subtopic of the codification  asc  requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated 
if fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance with the contingencies topic of the codification  asc  eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimate of the range of outcomes of recognized contingencies at the acquisition date 
for unrecognized contingencies  the fasb decided to require that entities include only the disclosures required by the contingencies topic of the codification  asc  and that those disclosures be included in the business combination footnote  requires that contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination be treated as contingent consideration of the acquirer and should be initially and subsequently measured at fair value in accordance with asc asc is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted asc effective january  and it did not have any material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued guidance on determining the useful life of intangible assets 
the implementation guidance and illustrations for intangibles other than goodwill  asc  discussed in the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the codification  amends the factors to be considered in determining the useful life of intangible assets 
its intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure its fair value by allowing an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the new guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by the company as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance regarding business combinations 
this accounting guidance  found under the business combinations topic of the codification  asc  retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions be used for all business combinations 
asc expands the disclosures previously required  better defines the acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination  and establishes principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired business 
asc changes the accounting for acquisition related costs from being included as part of the purchase price of a business acquired to being expensed as incurred and will require the acquiring company to recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally to be reflected in earnings  as opposed to additional purchase price of the acquired business 
as the company has a history of growing its business through acquisitions  the company anticipates that the adoption of fasb guidance included in asc will have an impact on its results of operations in future periods  which impact depends on the size and the number of acquisitions it consummates in the future 
according to the transition and open effective date information of the asc business combinations topic  asc  the acquirer shall record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to the acquired businesses 
certain of the company s acquisitions consummated in prior years would be subject to changes in accounting for the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
after december   reductions of valuation allowances would reduce the income tax provision as opposed to goodwill 
asc  effective for all business combinations with an acquisition date in the first annual period following december   was adopted by the company as of january  in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance regarding non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance  found under the consolidations topic of the codification  asc  and effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   requires the recognition of a non controlling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net earnings attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
this guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
the company adopted asc as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during and beyond to fund acquisitions and cash flow needs 
the debt is variable to the eurocurrency and prime rates 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future is similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
an adverse change of percent in interest rates from percent at december  to percent would add approximately million of interest cost annually based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december  the company historically has not actively managed interest rate exposure on variable rate debt or hedged its interest rate exposures 
however  the company is currently reviewing its interest rate management policies and procedures to ascertain the merits of hedging its interest rate exposures 
the company s million in outstanding fixed rate debt is fixed at rates that range from percent to percent 
foreign exchange exposure the company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  chinese yuan renminbi  malaysian ringgit  japanese yen  indian rupee and the australian dollar 
the company s results of operations were unfavorably affected by an increase in the average value of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies 
an adverse change of percent in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in sales of million  or percent  and a decrease in income before income taxes of million  or percent  for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded pre tax foreign exchange gains losses of million and million respectively
