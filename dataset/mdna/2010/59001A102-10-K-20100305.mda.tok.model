item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions during  the financial crisis and economic recession continued  while the prolonged and extended downturn in the homebuilding market worsened  causing downward pressure on home sales prices and asset values 
based on statistics from the realtytrac  processed foreclosures reached approximately million in  up from these record high foreclosure rates intensified competition for homebuyers in an already saturated marketplace with the influx of existing homes inventory  coupled with limited availability of mortgage financing resulting from the turmoil in the financial industry 
concern about the state of the economy and the job market further deteriorated consumer confidence  as unemployment rates as reported by the us department of labor rose steadily through the year  ending at  compared to at december we believe that the tepid demand we experienced reflected homebuyers reluctance to make a purchasing decision until they are comfortable that economic conditions have stabilized 
although we are seeing some early signs of recovery in certain markets  we believe the current conditions could continue  and we expect that our operations will remain depressed until the entire us economy rebounds 
summary company results our results for the year ended december  reflect the continued instability in the homebuilding and credit markets  as well as the general recession that has impacted the us economy during although we have seen some indications that some housing markets have reached a bottom  we do not know if we have reached a bottom in the national housing market  and we expect continued volatility throughout as the economy s recovery is projected to be uneven 
total home closing revenue was million for the year ended december   decreasing from billion for and from billion in we incurred a net loss for of million compared to a loss of million in and million in our results include million pre tax of real estate related impairments and an million tax benefit 
in  results include million pre tax of real estate related impairments and a million deferred tax valuation allowance charge 
in  we incurred million pre tax of goodwill related impairments and million pre tax of real estate related impairments  but benefitted from a million tax provision 
lower average home prices from competitive pressures increased the use of incentives during the last three years and the large volumes of impairments caused low gross margins on home closings of  and  respectively  in  and at december   our backlog of million was down from million at december  our december  backlog was million 
fewer home sales  compounded by high volumes of home closings during the fourth quarter of as customers took advantage of the previous november  tax credit deadline coupled with lower overall sales prices were primarily responsible for the decline in ending backlog 
our average sales price for homes in backlog decreased from  at december  to  at december  but held relatively steady at  at december   primarily due to mix of homes 
our cancellation rate on sales orders as a percentage of gross sales decreased in to  from and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  reflecting some stabilization of home prices and consumer confidence during the year 
although our cancellation rates decreased significantly during  we do not expect that cancellation rates will return completely to their historical levels until the excess supply of existing home inventory is absorbed and home prices fully stabilize 
company actions and positioning in response to the sustained and extended downturn in our industry  we are focusing on the following initiatives redesigning product offering to reduce costs and sales prices and tailor our product to meet today s buyers affordability demands  changing sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic  renegotiating construction costs with our subcontractors where possible  
table of contents exercising tight control over cash flows  managing our total lot supply by renegotiating or opting out of lot purchase and option contracts that are no longer aligned with our meritage forward strategy and contracting new bargain price finished lots  monitoring our customer satisfaction scores and working toward improving them based on the results of the surveys  launching our company wide operating strategy  meritage forward  and the roll out of associated initiatives such as the simply smart series  day closing guarantee and meritage green  and continuing to consolidate overhead functions at all of our divisions and corporate offices to reduce general and administrative cost burden 
in a response to our strategy to take advantage of capital opportunities  during we retired million of our senior subordinated notes maturing in by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions at an average discount from the face value of the notes  resulting in a million gain on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  there were no such extinguishments during or critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of these consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates and could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  are as follows revenue recognition in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  real estate retail land  we recognize revenue from home sales when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
although there is limited subjectivity in this accounting policy  we have designated revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of this balance in our statements of operations 

table of contents real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community or land is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by asc subtopic  property  plant and equipment 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community and impairments  if any 
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual lots on a relative value basis and are transferred to homes under construction when construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
land development budgets are reviewed monthly and updated as necessary 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated to the remaining homes in the community or phase 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
in such cases  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 
typically  a community s life cycle ranges from three to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the entitled land and continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community  the absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw land or finished lots 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby extending the lives of certain communities 
all of our land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
if an asset is deemed not recoverable  we are required to record impairment charges to the extent the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis and actual results may also differ from our assumptions 
our analysis is completed on a quarterly basis at a community level with each community or land parcel evaluated individually 
we pay particular attention to communities experiencing a larger than anticipated reduction in their absorption rates or averages sales prices or where gross margins are trending lower than anticipated 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds their fair value 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
existing and continuing communities when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from existing communities are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are deemed not fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
with each community or land parcel evaluated individually  the fair value of the community s assets is determined using either a discounted cash flow model for projects we intend to build out or a market based approach for projects we intend to sell 
impairments are charged to cost of home closings in the period during which the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
if a market based approach is used  we determine fair value based on recent comparable purchase and sales activity in the local market  adjusted for known variances as determined by our knowledge of the region and general real estate expertise 
when a discounted cash flow approach is used  we compute fair value based on a proprietary model 
our key estimates in deriving fair value under our cash flow model are i home selling prices in the community adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected sales absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace and expected cancellation rates  iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned and v our discount rate  which is currently 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
community level factors that may impact our key estimates include the presence and significance of local competitors  including their offered product type and competitive actions  economic and related demographic conditions for the population of the surrounding community  and desirability of the particular community  including unique amenities or other favorable or unfavorable attributes 
these local circumstances may significantly impact our assumptions and the resulting computation of fair value  and are  therefore  closely evaluated by our division personnel in their creation of the discounted cash flow models 
the models are also evaluated by regional and corporate personnel for consistency and integration  as decisions that affect pricing or absorption at one community may have resulting consequences for neighboring communities 
we typically do not project market improvements in our discounted cash flow models  but may do so in limited circumstances in the latter years of a long lived community 

table of contents option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing and continuing communities section above  we determine if the contributions to be generated by our future communities are acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that a community is still profitable and generating acceptable margins  those assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we decide to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
we may also elect to continue with a project because it has positive future cash flows  even though it may not be generating an accounting profit  or because of other strategic factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
due to the complexity and subjectivity of these fair value computations  as well as the significance of associated impairments to our financial statements for the past several years  we have concluded that the valuation of our real estate and associated assets is a critical accounting policy 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land inventories and real estate related joint venture investments 
additionally  we wrote off million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer economically feasible 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding these impairments and the associated remaining fair values of impaired communities 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover our exposure to absorb the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors as they relate to warranty type claims subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and  with the assistance of an actuary  we determine their sufficiency based on our and industry wide historical data and trends with respect to product types and geographical areas 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting an accrual of to of a home s sale price for the two year workmanship warranty depending on our loss history in the geographic area in which the home was built 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by approximately  in while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
all unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by either the cost or the equity method of accounting as the criteria for consolidation set forth in asc subtopic  consolidation  have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings loss from unconsolidated entities  net 

table of contents in order to determine if we should consolidate equity basis joint ventures  we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of  or have a controlling interest in  the unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include the profit loss sharing terms of the entity  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
as of december   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not have a controlling interest  and our ownership interest exceeds 
at december   we had equity investments of million related to unconsolidated entities with total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 
we also enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we analyze these agreements under subtopic to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity vie  if applicable  using a model developed by management 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  even though we do not have title to such land  we are required to consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies are excluded from our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including the benefit from net operating losses nols  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
companies must assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating losses and our experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
given the downturn in the homebuilding industry over the past several years  the degree of the economic recession  the instability and deterioration of the financial markets  and the resulting uncertainty in projections of our future taxable income  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during we continue to maintain a full non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets at december  as we have determined that the weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and it continues to be more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets and state nol carryovers 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million million federal and million state and million million federal and million state  respectively  against deferred tax assets which include the tax benefit from state nol carryovers 
our future deferred tax asset realization depends on sufficient taxable income in the carryforward periods under existing tax laws  which currently would allow us to offset future federal taxable income generated through state deferred tax assets include million and million in and  respectively  of state net operating loss carryovers  which begin to expire in on an ongoing basis  we will continue to review all available evidence to determine if and when we expect to realize our deferred tax assets and state nol carryovers 
at december  and  the income tax receivable of million and million  respectively  consist of net tax refunds that we expect to receive within one year 
the income tax receivable is due to enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act on november  the act amended internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year or to be carried back up to five years 
prior to the act  the loss carry back period was limited to two years 
we expect to carry back our federal net operating loss pursuant to the act and receive our refund in early 
table of contents share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock units nonvested shares outstanding under two stock compensation plans 
per the terms of these plans  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant  nor may options granted under the plans be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
after one year  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
our restricted stock generally vests on a pro rata basis over either three or five years 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is determined at the time of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
a decrease in our forfeiture rate would have increased our stock compensation by less than  in

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings for the year ended december  decreased million or when compared to the prior year  primarily due to the  reduction in units closed with a  lower average closing price 
lower sales volume of  units in as compared to  in  reflects the reduced demand caused by the industry downturn and the economic recession

the economic recession further amplified the pressure on sales prices and the lack of potential homebuyers interest in purchasing a new home during these uncertain times 
additionally  the influx of foreclosures  increases in unemployment rates and the tighter lending standards for obtaining mortgage financing during the current credit crisis both for our homebuyers as well as for the buyers of their existing homes also dampened demand 
although we have recently identified several national positive indicators that the downturn is bottoming  such as declines in average months available inventory and stabilization of us average home sales prices  we believe the recovery will be uneven and expect a continued challenging market throughout west 
in  home closings decreased to units with a value of million  a or million decrease in home closing revenue as compared to  driven by continued weakness in california and nevada 
the region s decrease in active communities was the primary contributor to the unit decrease in closings as compared to the region s ending backlog of million only decreased when compared to the prior year s million  reflecting our late year successes with our newly opened communities and revised product offerings in california 
as california was one of the first markets impacted by the downturn in  we believe it will also be one of the first to pull out of the current constrained market conditions

fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin improved to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  margins in benefited from a lower basis for our inventory resulting from prior period impairments 
our impairment charges reflect the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets 
the recent and prolonged downturn in the general economy and homebuilding industry in particular  led to declines in the values of these assets and the abandonment and corresponding write off of certain of our investments 
excluding current period impairments  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the relatively flat gross margins excluding impairments are primarily the result of declines in average sales prices of home deliveries  partially offset by cost savings from re negotiated construction contracts and reductions in our asset basis caused by impairments taken in prior periods for homes closed in the current period 
we provide gross margins excluding impairments a non gaap term as we use it to evaluate our performance and believe it is a widely accepted financial measure by users of our financial statements in analyzing our operating results and provides comparability to similar calculations by our peers in the homebuilding industry 
as reflected in our lower average sales prices in our orders and backlog  the types of incentives we offer vary by market  community and model and may include discounts on home prices  free or discounted upgrades and options  and the payment of a portion of buyer closing costs 
however  as previously noted  we are scaling back on standard features offered in our base home models  designing smaller homes as part of our simply smart series that are more efficiently constructed and re bidding construction material and labor contracts  targeting a reduction from peak construction costs of mid to late these savings should allow us to offer more affordable homes and compete for a larger base of potential homebuyers  with a focus on the first time and first move up demographics and maintaining our margins

we are also reducing the size of our model complexes and outfitting homes with fewer options and upgrades to highlight a payment oriented sales approach  demonstrating what a homebuyer can truly afford rather than an options loaded model complex  which has been successful with our buyers of homes at lower price points  and reduced our model home costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million for versus although we continue to execute on our cost cutting and streamlining strategy  particularly in headcount and salary expense reductions  the significant revenue decline resulted in our general and administrative expenses increasing as a percentage of home closing revenue 
reducing the expenses is million received from a successful legal settlement 
excluding these proceeds  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest incurred  but not capitalized  on our senior and senior subordinated notes  credit facility and other borrowings 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
due to our concentrated efforts to reduce inventory through faster cycle times and to sell under performing assets  the balance of our inventory that is eligible for interest capitalization dropped below the corresponding volume of our debt in and continues to decrease  resulting in a charge of a significantly larger portion of our interest incurred being expensed directly to our statements of operations 
interest expense in also includes million related to the amendment of and subsequent termination of our credit facility 
similar amendment charges in were million 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were for  compared to for the change in our tax rate during is primarily attributable to the expected tax benefit from recently enacted federal tax legislation that enables us to carry back our nol five years 
the tax rate was lower due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that year 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal commissions and other sales costs 
as a percentage of home closing revenue  these costs increased to for from for these increases primarily reflect additional costs incurred for intensified sales and marketing efforts across our markets combined with lower average prices obtained per home closing 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million for versus the decrease includes million received from a successful legal settlement in the second quarter of the balance includes a million non cash compensation charge related to a tender offer where we repurchased certain previously issued stock options 
excluding these one time items  our general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively 
although we continued to execute on our cost cutting and streamlining strategy during  particularly in headcount and salary expense reductions  the significant revenue decline resulted in our general and administrative expenses remaining steady as a percentage of home closing revenue 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
during  we fully impaired our remaining intangibles related to the acquisition of greater homes in orlando 
the million impairment is reported in our goodwill and intangible asset impairments line in our statement of operations 
in  we wrote off million of our goodwill and related intangible assets as a result of the weakened homebuilding market and accounting valuation techniques that incorporate the declining stock prices in deriving the fair value of our reporting units 
these charges resulted in a complete write down of all of our remaining goodwill 
interest expense 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively

liquidity and capital resources overview our principal uses of capital for were operating expenses  home construction  the payment of routine liabilities and the acquisition of new lot positions 
we used funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions and construction of model homes for finished lot acquisitions 
for raw land purchases  we also need to fund plat and other approvals  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized as an expense in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred 
from a liquidity standpoint  we were experiencing the positive effects of the homebuilding cash flow cycle over the last couple of years  as our debt balances have decreased and our cash balances have increased as our community count declines 
as these older communities are closing out and our inventory volumes decrease  we have begun to acquire new lots 
accordingly  on a go forward basis  we expect that cash outlays for land purchases may exceed our cash generated by operations as demand for new homes stabilizes and improves and we begin to expand our business 
during  we purchased about  lots for million  started about  lots and closed  homes 
we exercise strict controls and believe we have a prudent strategy for company wide cash management  particularly as related to cash outlays for land and inventory acquisition development 
we generated million of positive operating cash flows during due mainly to the collection of million of income tax refunds while executing on our strategy of reducing inventory and curtailing spending on under performing assets 
the operating cash flows were also generated by our inventory reduction of million  contributing to our ending cash  restricted cash and investments balance of million at december  we also expect to collect approximately million in tax refunds in early as we have no bond maturities until  we intend to generate cash from the sale of our inventory  but we plan to redeploy that cash to acquire well positioned lots that represent opportunities to generate more normal margins and grow our presold home inventory to support sales volume increases 

table of contents in addition  we continue to evaluate our capital needs in light of ongoing developments in homebuilding markets and our existing capital structure 
we believe that we currently have strong liquidity 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital to strengthen our liquidity position  enable us to opportunistically acquire additional land inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions  and or strengthen our long term capital structure 
such additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt financing and may be from a variety of sources 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and increase our interest costs 
we believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management 
debt to capital and net debt to capital are calculated as follows dollars in thousands at december  at december  notes payable and other borrowings stockholders equity total capital debt to capital notes payable and other borrowings less cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments and securities net debt stockholders equity total net capital net debt to capital debt to capital is computed as notes payable and other borrowing divided by the aggregate of total notes payable and stockholders equity 
net debt to capital is computed as net debt divided by the aggregate of net debt and stockholders equity 
credit facility in september  we voluntarily terminated our senior unsecured credit facility the credit facility 
there were no penalties or costs associated with the termination  although we recorded a non cash charge in the third quarter of of approximately  to write off previously capitalized origination fees that were scheduled to amortize through may we did not believe we would need the credit facility to finance our operations during the foreseeable future and believe it was in our interest to terminate the facility to avoid non use and other fees 
prior to and as of the date of termination  we were in compliance with all of the covenants  limitations and restrictions of the credit facility 
covenant compliance senior and senior subordinated notes 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed a million private placement of senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued at par  and their associated proceeds were used to pay down our credit facility 
the covenants related to these senior subordinated notes are substantially similar to the covenants of our senior notes discussed below 
during  we exchanged approximately  shares of our common stock for million of our senior subordinated notes in a privately negotiated transaction at an average discount from the face of the value of the notes 

table of contents senior notes in march  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indenture that governs our existing senior notes discussed below  except that  among other things  the indenture for the senior notes does not require us to maintain a certain level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness is unlimited  and with respect to other indebtedness is million  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the indenture for our senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
if we do not meet both the fixed charge ratio and the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth covenants as defined in our senior and senior subordinated indentures discussed below  we are generally prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness 
our actual fixed charge ratio and ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth as of december  were 
to and to  respectively 
we were in compliance with all senior and senior subordinated note covenants as of december  the following are our most restrictive key note covenants financial covenant covenant requirement actual in millions fixed charge coverage leverage ratio minimum net worth failure to maintain both the fixed change coverage ratio and the leverage ratio does not result in a default under our senior and senior subordinated notes 
rather  it results in a prohibition subject to exceptions from incurring additional indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with our leverage ratio and therefore  the prohibition against incurring additional debt is not applicable 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for all outstanding balances on our senior and senior subordinated notes 

table of contents land option and purchase contracts we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
currently  our slower sales rate is causing us to take certain actions  including purchasing lots in advance of corresponding sales  re negotiating the takedown schedules  and discontinuing lot purchases and forfeiting the related non refundable option deposit 
during  we executed on our goal to reduce lots under control 
the success of this strategy is evidenced by our total ending lot position  with  lots under control at december  as compared to  at december  at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
during  we also managed our lot supply  entering into new land contracts for approximately  lots for million as compared to approximately  lots for million in additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes   and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal  senior and senior subordinated notes interest  senior and senior subordinated notes liabilities related to interest not owned operating lease obligations total see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
total contractual obligations exclude million related to our unrecognized tax benefits as we are unable to determine the period during which a settlement  if any  will occur with the corresponding tax authority 
we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or recent accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recently issued accounting standards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes  million in principal of our senior notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the year ended december  follows december  for the years ended december  fair value at december  thereafter total a dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is derived from quoted market prices by independent dealers 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
