item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of december  and you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the section entitled special note about forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview we are a leisure travel company 
the focus of our business is a low cost passenger airline marketed to leisure travelers in small cities 
our business model emphasizes low operating costs  diversified revenue sources  and the transport of passengers from small cities to leisure destinations 
our route network  pricing philosophy  product offering and advertising are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services from us 
we provide limited frequency nonstop scheduled service to leisure destinations 
we provide service primarily to las vegas nevada  orlando florida  phoenix arizona  tampa st 
petersburg florida  los angeles california and ft 
lauderdale florida  six of the most popular leisure destinations in the united states  along with limited service to other leisure destinations 
we fly charter fixed fee services under long term contracts primarily for harrah s entertainment inc and on an on demand ad hoc basis 
results during  we achieved a company record operating margin  to earn net income of million on operating revenues of million 
we achieved these operating results despite a decrease in scheduled service revenue per passenger year over year  and while significantly expanding our route network  with system departure growth of and system available seat miles asms growth of 
our revenues increased year over year as our growth in passengers carried and an increase in ancillary revenue per passenger more than offset the effect of base fare reductions 
the us economy continues to be impacted by the financial crisis which began in a significant reduction in air fares was felt by the airline industry as a result of the effects of these economic conditions on consumer spending and air travel demand 
while our average base fare fell during as we reduced fares to stimulate air travel demand  our ancillary revenue per passenger grew  compared to the prior year  from to 
our efforts to stimulate air travel demand were successful as our scheduled service load factor for was  and even improved on the scheduled service load factor we achieved in we believe our ancillary revenue per passenger and our ability to maintain high load factors during this difficult revenue environment  especially during a period of substantial capacity growth  were key contributors to our financial results for the reduction in crude oil prices in compared to their peak reached during the third quarter was also a major factor contributing to our increased profitability 
our average fuel cost per gallon decreased from in to in as fuel cost was highly volatile during these years 
the average cost per gallon reached a record high of in the second quarter of  before retracting to a low of in the first quarter of  and increased through to in the fourth quarter of we believe we continue to be positioned to manage to profitability through periods of fuel cost volatility in the future 
during  our operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  remained consistent with and levels of and  respectively 
we 
table of contents maintained this operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  despite higher maintenance and repairs expense during the year 
fleet during  we placed eight aircraft into service which increased our operating fleet to aircraft at december  five of these aircraft were previously leased to a third party and were returned to us off lease during the year  two were under separate operating leases we entered into in february and the final one was purchased for cash in january the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated december  december  december  own a lease total own a lease total own a lease total md s mds total a aircraft owned includes aircraft subject to capital leases as follows december   december   december  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into purchase agreements for md series aircraft for delivery in the first three quarters of the aircraft include md aircraft which we expect to place into service by the end of the remaining five aircraft are md aircraft which we expect to use as a source of spare engines and spare parts 
we believe these additional aircraft will provide for our planned growth through at a low fixed cost  and will also provide further flexibility to manage capacity in our route network 
network as of december   we offered scheduled service from small cities on routes primarily into our major leisure destinations 
we expanded our route network during with a new major leisure destination  additional routes to our existing major leisure destinations and network changes involving leisure destinations served on a limited basis 
in april  we initiated service into our sixth major leisure destination  los angeles  with eleven routes being served as of december  during the first half of  we initiated limited service to the new leisure destination of punta gorda  florida and seasonal service to the new leisure destination of myrtle beach  south carolina  with service on two routes to each of these new destinations 
we also initiated service in june to the san francisco bay area from eugene  oregon  a route that consists of an existing small city and an existing leisure destination we serve on a limited basis 
we believe the continued expansion of our route network has provided us geographic diversity with further protection from competitive influences 
table of contents in the markets we serve and continued growth in our customer base 
the following shows the number of destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated as of december  major leisure destinations other leisure destinations small cities served total cities served routes to las vegas routes to orlando routes to phoenix routes to tampa bay st 
petersburg routes to los angeles routes to ft 
lauderdale other routes total routes trends and uncertainties during  aircraft fuel expense declined compared to  but continues to represent a significant portion of our overall operating expenses 
although we experienced a reduction in fuel costs in  average cost per gallon was in the first quarter in  and increased sequentially each quarter throughout the year  finishing at for the fourth quarter of fuel availability is subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil  gasoline and other petroleum products 
the cost of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty and further fuel cost volatility will most likely have a significant impact on our future results of operations 
in march  allegiant information systems  inc  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary  completed a merger with the organization which owned the exclusive rights to the travel applications of the software operating system we have used since our inception 
the acquisition of the software through the merger has provided us more control over the development of our automation into the future 
in addition  we have made further hardware and database platform purchases to provide us with the necessary capacity to continue our growth 
the hardware and database upgrades are intended to facilitate additional offerings of web based products 
we believe our control over the development will enable us to provide our customers with products unique to us  further differentiate us in the travel industry  and expand our customers travel experience 
in we have begun an initiative to emphasize and focus on revenue growth from third party products  but we do not anticipate significant short term revenue growth 
we believe our efforts to enhance software capabilities and provide additional product offerings  along with our loyal customer base  could result in meaningful long term revenue growth in this area of our business 
in february  we established an operational base at orlando international airport 
routes into orlando  florida from ten of our small cities will be shifted from orlando sanford international airport to orlando international airport by march in addition  we announced we will establish a new operational base at grand rapids  michigan in april the aircraft base in grand rapids will be our second small city base 
we believe basing aircraft in a small city gives us cost effective scheduling options to facilitate service to destinations where bases are currently not in place 
we currently serve routes from grand rapids to five of our major leisure destinations  with seasonal service to myrtle beach  south carolina scheduled to begin in april our seasonal service to 
table of contents myrtle beach from two other small cities proved to be successful in and we have scheduled expansion of this service during as part of our capacity growth for the summer season 
as discussed above  we entered into agreements for the purchase of md series aircraft for delivery in the first three quarters of we expect to place of these aircraft into service by the end of and believe these aircraft will support our future growth plans 
in addition  we will utilize five of these aircraft for spare engines and rotable parts 
we benefited from the current market conditions of md aircraft during with the purchase of ten aircraft we have used for spare engines and rotable parts 
we believe the use of engines and rotable parts from acquired aircraft for part out has provided us a cost effective way of servicing our operating fleet 
in most situations  the use of spare engines and rotable parts is less expensive than performing maintenance and repairs of existing rotable parts 
in march  we entered into a purchase contract for six boeing aircraft with delivery dates from to these aircraft will provide us the ability to serve longer haul markets  including the expectation to serve hawaii after we receive regulatory approval for extended over water operations 
we currently expect two of these aircraft to enter operating service in fourth quarter with the remaining four aircraft to be added to our operating fleet in and as a result of the recent rise in jet fuel prices and the current weak revenue environment  we expect moderate growth for our capacity growth will largely be attributable to new routes being added to our network  utilization of our new aircraft bases and an increase in seasonal flying 
we believe this is our best approach to maintain profitability and  as we have in the past  we expect to continue to quickly adjust capacity up or down as appropriate to react to significant changes in industry fare levels and the economy 
our operating revenue our operating revenue comprises of both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of air fare for nonstop flights between our small city markets and our leisure destinations 
fixed fee contract revenue 
our fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of fixed flying agreements with affiliates of harrah s entertainment inc that provide for a predictable revenue stream 
we also provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis to other customers 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from air related charges and third party products 
air related revenue is generated through charges for use of our website to purchase tickets  checked bags  advance seat assignments  priority boarding and other services provided in conjunction with our scheduled air service 
we also generate revenue from third party products through the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website 
we recognize our ancillary revenues net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees 
other revenue 
other revenue is generated from aircraft and flight equipment leased to third parties 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal in nature with traffic demand historically being weaker in the third quarter and stronger in the first quarter 
our operating revenue is largely driven by perceived product value  advertising and promotional activities and can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced leisure travel spending  such as the back to school season 

table of contents our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of aircraft fuel  fuel taxes  into plane fees and airport fuel flowage  storage or through put fees 
under the majority of our fixed fee contracts  amounts we receive to reimburse us for fuel costs are netted against fuel expense 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense includes wages  salaries  and employee bonuses  sales commissions for in flight personnel  as well as expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
station operations expense 
station operations expense includes the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services  commissary expenses and other related services such as deicing of aircraft 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense includes all parts  materials and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
also included are fees for repairs performed by third party vendors 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense includes all advertising  promotional expenses  travel agent commissions and credit card discount fees associated with the sale of scheduled service and air related charges 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense consists of the cost of leasing aircraft under operating leases with third parties 
also included are maintenance deposits when not considered part of maintenance and repair expense as discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates below 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft that we own and amortization of aircraft that we operate under capital leases 
other expense 
other expense includes the cost of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance and all other insurance policies except for employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes the loss on aircraft and other equipment disposals  travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  facility lease expenses  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
results of operations the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the last three fiscal years

we achieved a operating margin for with system growth in departures of and asms of  despite a reduction in scheduled service revenue of per passenger year over year 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a increase in ancillary revenue from air related charges and a increase in scheduled service revenue  partially offset by a decrease in fixed fee contract revenue 
the ancillary revenue from air related charges and scheduled service revenue increases were primarily driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers 
system asms increased by  as a result of  a increase in system departures 
operating revenue per asm rasm decreased by from cents during to cents during the decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in our scheduled service average base fare offset by an increase in ancillary revenue per passenger 
we decreased scheduled service base fares to maintain load factor in the face of industry wide lower fares and adverse economic conditions 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  from million in the increase was a result of a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers offset by a decrease in the scheduled service average base fare of from in to in passenger growth was driven primarily as a result of a increase in departures from  to  in significant contributors to the departure growth were the addition of  departures attributable to our new service to los angeles not operated in and an increase of  departures from route expansion to our phoenix market 
we offered service into phoenix on routes at december  compared to routes at december  remaining departure growth is a result of increased frequency of flying to our other major leisure destinations and departures to new limited service destinations 
our route network consisted of routes at december   an increase from routes at december  ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger on a per passenger basis  and  of our total ancillary revenues consist of air related charges for and  respectively 
the increase in air related charges per passenger was primarily attributable to higher baggage fees as we increased fees to comparable industry levels  an increase in our customer convenience fee  and the effect of a full year of our priority boarding product rolled out in october we increased our customer convenience fee from to in january and to in july third party products declined on a per passenger basis but increased 
table of contents slightly in absolute terms due to las vegas contributing a smaller percentage of our total passengers 
our third party products revenue per passenger for las vegas is higher than our other destinations due to large volume of hotel rooms we sell in las vegas 
the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products 
third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp a includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions during  we generated gross revenue of million from third party products  which resulted in net revenue of million 
the majority of the gross revenue was generated from the sale of over  hotel room nights at our leisure destinations packaged to our customers with scheduled air service 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue decreased to million during from million for as we had  block hours of fixed fee flying in compared to  in the decrease is primarily due to a decline in block hours flown under the harrah s fixed fee agreement partially offset by a increase in other fixed fee flying programs for reduction in the harrah s fixed fee revenues was also attributable to the impact of a new contract which went into effect january  under the new harrah s contract  harrah s reimburses us for the entire amount of fuel costs incurred 
the per block hour rate we charge harrah s is therefore reduced from the rate we charged under the previous harrah s contracts under which we had been responsible for a portion of the fuel expenses 
the harrah s reno program was closed in november with the laughlin program expected to increase by similar amount of flying previously operated from reno 
new fixed fee flying for included agreements for the cuban family charter program  which began in june  flying under an agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc  and fixed fee flying for the department of defense which began in april the cuban family charter program fixed fee flying was permanently ceased in october and the agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc ended in december other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million and million during and  respectively 
the revenue was primarily generated as a result of our april purchase of six md aircraft and three engines on lease to another airline 
the six purchased aircraft have since been returned to us  with all of these aircraft having been placed in service as of december  with the return of all of these aircraft  we are not presently generating significant other revenue 
while we do not regularly seek to lease aircraft or engines to third parties  the economics of acquiring these particular aircraft and engines close to the end of their existing leases to third parties were attractive and we may in the future engage in similar leasing activities 

table of contents operating expenses despite a significant increase in departures  our operating expenses decreased by to million in compared to million in as the reduction in fuel expense more than offset expense increases in other line items resulting from increased service and other factors 
we primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger across different periods which enable us to assess trends in each expense category 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
the table also presents operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by the number of passengers carried 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel our per passenger costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in fuel expense per passenger as a result of a increase in the number of system passengers and a reduction in system average cost per gallon for compared to the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods 
the table also presents operating casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by available seat miles 
as on a per passenger basis  excluding fuel on an asm basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
we do not believe casm is the most appropriate measure by which to evaluate our cost management due to the evolving nature of our route network  our aggressive approach to managing capacity ie  asms on a seasonal basis  and the changing utilization of our fleet which results in some of our expenses being more fixed as opposed to varying directly with asm production 
we provide this 
table of contents table as a convenience because we recognize that casm is widely used to compare costs in the airline industry 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
despite our significant year over year expansion of service  aircraft fuel expense decreased to million for  down from million for  driven by a decrease in the system average cost per gallon to from 
system gallons consumed increased to million from million attributable to our system departure growth 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million for up from million for mainly as a result of a significant increase in accrued employee bonus expense and an increase in the number of full time equivalent employees 
the increase in accrued employee bonus expense was driven by the significant year over year increase in operating income 
we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees at december  compared to  at december   a increase in line with our fleet growth from an average number of aircraft in service of in to in excluding accrued employee bonus expense  stock compensation expense and other incentives  our salary and benefits expense per average full time equivalent employee increased by only year over year 
station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in principally attributable to the impact of increased scheduled service departures of 
our station operations expense on a per departure basis increased by only year over year 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased  to million for up from million for as the average number of aircraft in service increased from in to in the increase is primarily attributable to scheduled heavy aircraft maintenance checks performed and impact of the growth in our fleet on the repair of rotable aircraft parts for compared to  a non recurring inventory adjustment related to low value usage expendables during the first quarter of  offset by a decrease in the engine maintenance expense from less expensive engine maintenance events 
in comparison with the prior year  our scheduled heavy aircraft maintenance checks increased both in the number of events and average expense per event  with percentage increases of and  respectively 
our average maintenance and repairs expense per aircraft per month increased from approximately  in to approximately  in the timing of maintenance events may cause our maintenance and repairs expense to vary significantly from period to period 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of advertising expenses associated with entrance into 
table of contents new markets including the new major leisure destination of los angeles which launched service in may aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased by to million in down from million in in each of and  we had four aircraft under operating lease agreements 
in  the average expense per aircraft was lower due to the purchase in of two aircraft under lease being replaced by two less expensive aircraft which we began leasing in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of  as the number of aircraft owned including those leased to a third party or subject to capital lease  increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase was attributable to the impact of lowering the depreciable lives of our engines at the beginning of and additional depreciation related to non aircraft equipment purchases during other expense 
other expense increased to million for compared to million for the increase is due to an increase of million in losses attributable to dispositions of engines and a reduction in the value of engines we hold on consignment 
another contributing factor to the increase is from other expenses associated with our growth  such as rent for our company headquarters and aircraft insurance 
other income expense other income expense increased  from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the increased expense is primarily attributable to a reduction of interest income earned on cash balances in compared to the same period of partially offset by a reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the higher effective tax rate for was largely due to the geographic mix from our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our tax rates 
compared to we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in due to increases in scheduled service  fixed fee contract  ancillary and other revenue 
the increase in operating revenue outpaced a increase in total system passengers  indicating our success in increasing revenue per passenger from to the increase in system passengers was in turn driven by a increase in system departures and an increase in system load factor from to 

table of contents asms increased by a more modest as the increase in departures was offset by a decline in average stage length 
rasm increased by  as we successfully grew revenue  particularly ancillary revenue  faster than capacity in scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million in from million in driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers carried and a reduction in scheduled service air fare per passenger 
scheduled service air fare per passenger declined only despite a reduction in scheduled average stage length from to scheduled service passenger growth was driven by a increase in scheduled service departures and a percentage point increase in scheduled service load factor to 
departure growth in was driven in part by the full year effect of our newly established major leisure destinations of phoenix and ft 
lauderdale in late  as well as service increases in our other bases 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased to million in up from million in as we had  block hours of fixed fee flying in compared to  in the substantial increase in fixed fee contract revenue was primarily due to additional flying under a contract with a third harrah s entertainment  inc subsidiary that started in january and under a contract with mlt vacations which began in may and ended in october  neither of which were in place in the prior year 
block hours for fixed fee flying under harrah s contract increased  from  hours during to  hours during these new contracts more than offset the loss of revenue from our contract with apple vacations west which ended in april ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger was due to the sale of several new products and higher prices charged for certain existing products 
for instance  the adoption of checked baggage fees by almost all of the larger airlines in the united states facilitated the increase in our baggage fees to comparable levels

table of contents during  we generated gross revenue of million from third party products  which resulted in net revenue of million 
the majority of the gross revenue was generated from the sale of over  hotel room nights at our leisure destinations packaged to our customers with scheduled air service 
other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million during as a result of the purchase of six md aircraft and three engines on lease to another airline early in the year 
two of these aircraft were returned to us under the terms of the lease in the fourth quarter of and one of these was placed in service by the end of we generated other revenue of million in due to the purchase of eight engines on lease to another airline 
we received these engines in the fourth quarter of under the terms of the lease

table of contents aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased to million in  up from million in  driven by a substantial increase in the average cost per gallon to during from in  coupled with a increase in gallons consumed to million from million 
the increase in gallons consumed was in line with the increase in system departures of and the reduction in average stage length of for the year 
beginning in  we started taking significant steps to conserve fuel which includes taxi ing with one engine and ensuring flights were flown at more fuel efficient speeds 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in full time equivalent employees to support a increase in our average fleet from during to aircraft during we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees at december   compared to  full time equivalent employees at december  in addition  our monthly average salary and benefit expense per full time equivalent increased to  during compared to  during station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in driven by increased system departures of 
station operations expense per departure increased only in compared to despite much fuller aircraft  as reflected in a percentage point increase in system load factor from in to in the modest increase in station operations expense per departure occurred despite a significant increase in the proportion of fixed fee flying for  which generally has a higher station operations expense per departure 
during  of total system departures were fixed fee flying  compared to during maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million in compared to million in the percentage increase in expense greatly exceeded the increase in the average number of aircraft in our fleet from in to in among the main reasons for significantly increased maintenance costs were an increase in repair costs of rotable parts  increased engine maintenance events  and an increase in scheduled heavy maintenance checks from in to in the timing and type of maintenance events may cause our maintenance and repairs expense to vary significantly from period to period and this occurred from to  as each maintenance event that happened to be required during was more costly  on average  than those of sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in  driven primarily by an increase in credit card discount fees associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased slightly to million in from million in the average number of aircraft under operating leases during was comparable to the average for in july  we purchased for cash two md aircraft that had been operated under operating leases which reduced the total number of aircraft under operating leases to two as of december  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  in line with the increase in the number of aircraft owned and subject to capital leases which increased from at december  to at december  the number of aircraft at december  included aircraft on lease to a third party at the time of acquisition 
other expense 
other expense increased by to million in compared to million in due mainly to increased aviation insurance as our fleet increased in size  higher loss from engine dispositions  and increased rent associated with our new company headquarters building 

table of contents other income expense other income expense changed from a net other income of million in to a net other expense of million in this change is primarily attributable to two factors a gain on fuel derivatives of million in compared to a minimal loss on our few remaining fuel derivatives in and a reduction in interest income earned on cash balances from million in to million as a result of lower prevailing interest rates 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to in the lower effective tax rate for was largely attributable to the year over year geographic mix of our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources during  our primary source of funds was cash generated by our operations 
our operating cash flows have allowed us to maintain a high level of liquidity while growing our fleet and meeting our short term obligations 
our future needs for capital are generally for the purchase of additional aircraft 
to meet future capital needs  we expect to continue to use operating cash flows 
as we have done in the past  we also would consider raising funds through debt financing if terms are acceptable 
however  access to financing is not required for us to meet our future capital obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into purchase agreements for md series aircraft for delivery in the first three quarters of we anticipate funding the purchase of these aircraft with available cash assets 
current liquidity our total cash  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
restricted cash represents credit card deposits  escrowed funds under our fixed fee flying contracts  and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel partners for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
short term investments represent marketable securities which are available for sale 
during and  our restricted cash balances increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of an increase in the number of letters of credit and higher amounts on a number of existing letters of credit issued to our hotel vendors and some airports 
under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 
sources and uses of cash operating activities 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during the cash flows provided by operations for were primarily the result of million of net income and a million increase in air traffic liability  which results from passenger bookings for future travel 
during  net income was million and air traffic liability declined from the previous year 
the cash flows provided from these items in were partially offset by million of cash used for the prepayment of hotel rooms 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities during was million compared to million used in cash used in investing activities for both years reflected the purchase of md aircraft  expenditures required for the induction of owned aircraft to enter our operating fleet and the purchase of rotable and other parts 
during  we spent million primarily for 
table of contents aircraft  ten of which are to be used as a source of spare engines and parts 
during  we spent million primarily on aircraft  two of which were previously under operating leases  five of which were previously under capital leases  six aircraft purchased free and clear  and two other aircraft purchased with partial financing 
the six aircraft purchased free and clear were acquired in april while sub leased to a third party 
the aircraft were returned to us gradually over and  with the majority of the induction costs related to these six aircraft incurred during when five aircraft entered our operating fleet 
we also used cash in the purchase of available for sale investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities  of million in compared to million in financing activities 
we used million of cash in financing activities during compared to million used in cash used in financing activities for consisted of million to make principal payments on our debt obligations and million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
these outflows were partially offset by proceeds of million attributable to a loan agreement secured by two previously unencumbered aircraft 
during  we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock and million to retire capital lease obligations for five aircraft and make other debt principal payments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million obtained from the financing of ten aircraft 
debt of the aircraft total aircraft in operating fleet we own as of december   we had secured debt financing on aircraft  capital lease financing on two aircraft  with the remaining aircraft owned free and clear 
during  we received proceeds of million through the issuance of notes payable secured by two aircraft

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
revenue recognition 
scheduled service revenue consists of passenger revenue involving limited frequency nonstop flights between our leisure destinations and small cities recognized when the travel related service or transportation is provided or when the itinerary expires unused 
nonrefundable scheduled itineraries expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance 
itineraries sold for transportation  but not yet used  as well as unexpired credits  are included in air traffic liability 
various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities 
these taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority 
fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of long term agreements to provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis to affiliates of harrah s entertainment inc  department of defense dod and others 
fixed fee contract revenue is recognized when the transportation is provided 
ancillary revenue consists of passenger revenue from air related charges and third party products 
air related charges include optional services provided to passengers such as the use of our website to purchase scheduled service transportation  advance seat assignments  priority boarding  unlimited changes to nonrefundable itineraries and other services 
revenues from air related charges are recognized when the transportation is provided if the product is not deemed independent of the scheduled service 
revenues from change fees for charges imposed on passengers for making changes to nonrefundable itineraries are recognized as they occur 
ancillary revenue is also generated from third party products such as the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars  ticket attractions and other items 
revenues from the sale of third party products are recognized at the time the product is utilized  such as the time a purchased hotel room is occupied 
the amount of revenues attributed to each element of a bundled sale involving air related charges and third party products in addition to airfare is determined in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the sale of ancillary revenue products is recorded net of amounts paid to wholesale 
table of contents providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees in accordance with revenue reporting accounting standards 
effective october   we adopted an accounting convention for the recognition of revenue from our travel protection product trip flex for unlimited changes to nonrefundable itineraries 
the adoption of this accounting convention results in recognition of the related revenue at the time the transportation is provided  a change from the previously used accounting convention for the recognition of revenue at the time of purchase 
we concluded for  and the interim periods of  that the difference between the application of these accounting conventions is not material to the results of operations  the applicable individual elements of our financial statements or our financial position 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment and other miscellaneous sources 
lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
we account for maintenance activities under the direct expense method 
under this method  maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft  including major overhaul maintenance costs  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
as a lessee  we may be required under provisions of our lease agreements to make payments to the lessor in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities 
these payments of maintenance deposits are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
guidance on accounting for maintenance deposits requires these payments to be accounted for as an asset until reimbursed for incurred maintenance costs or until it is determined that any portion of the estimated total of the deposit is less than probable of being returned 
in addition  payments of maintenance deposits that are not substantially and contractually related to the maintenance of the leased asset are expensed as incurred 
maintenance deposits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
under our existing aircraft lease agreements with purchase options  if we exercise the option to purchase the aircraft and there are excess maintenance deposit balances upon the exercise of the purchase option  any excess amounts are applied to the purchase price as an additional down payment 
fuel derivatives 
in accordance with derivative instruments accounting standards  we have not historically qualified for hedge accounting 
therefore  we have accounted for unrealized changes in fair value of fuel derivative contracts in other income expense of our consolidated statements of income
