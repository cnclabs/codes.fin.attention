item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis md a provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other readers to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we design  manufacture  and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf and agricultural micro irrigation systems  landscaping equipment  and residential yard and snow removal products worldwide 
we sell our products worldwide through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet 
our businesses are organized into three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and is shown as other 
our emphasis is to provide innovative  well built  and dependable products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues have historically been  and we expect they will continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
we define new products as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years 
summary of fiscal results fiscal was a recovery year after experiencing a difficult year during fiscal our fiscal results included the following items of significance net sales for fiscal increased by percent to  million compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased demand for our products largely resulting from improved economic conditions in the us and certain international markets where we conduct business  the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers  and the significant reduction in field inventory levels during fiscal that was not duplicated in fiscal professional segment net sales  which represented over percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal  grew percent to  million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong sales in the golf market and customer acceptance of new products introduced  particularly for landscape contractor equipment 
our residential segment net sales were also up by percent to million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of continued strong demand for our products and additional product placement for our zero turn radius riding mowers 
shipments of snow thrower products also increased due to strong demand from heavy snow falls during the winter season of and the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products 
international net sales for fiscal were up percent to million compared to fiscal  due to increased demand as a result of new golf development projects  mainly in asia  additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and sales of our water conserving products for agricultural markets to meet growing worldwide demand  and improved economic conditions in certain international markets resulting in increased demand for our products 
approximately million of this net sales growth was the result of the weakening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
international net sales comprised percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal fiscal net earnings rose percent to million compared to fiscal  and diluted net earnings per share increased percent to compared to fiscal our one year initiative  in one back on course  was successful as we surpassed our goal of five percent profit after tax as a percentage of net sales for fiscal by achieving percent profit after tax as a percentage of net sales 
gross margin was percent in fiscal  up basis points from percent in fiscal as we experienced increased demand for our products in fiscal  our manufacturing costs were lower from increased plant utilization  which benefited our gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  our gross margin for fiscal was positively impacted by increased sales of our higher margin products as compared to fiscal and continued cost reduction efforts 
however  higher commodity prices in fiscal compared to fiscal hindered our gross margin growth rate 
although selling  general  and administrative sg a expense was up percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily from higher employee incentive compensation related to improved financial performance  most other sg a costs were down  reflecting structural cost reductions and continued spending discipline 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was down to percent compared to percent in fiscal we continued to place emphasis on  and take proactive measures related to  reducing working capital and improving asset management 
as a result of these efforts  we achieved our long term goal to reduce average net working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables as a percent of net sales below percent  or to the teens  in fiscal our average net working capital as a percent of net sales as of the end of fiscal was percent 
our domestic field inventory levels were also slightly down as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal due in part to our continued focus to improve field inventory management 
we continued our history of paying cash dividends and we increased our fiscal quarterly cash dividend by percent to per share compared to our quarterly cash dividend in fiscal of per share 
our stock repurchase program returned a significant amount of cash to our shareholders during fiscal  which reduced our number of shares outstanding 
this reduction resulted in a benefit to our diluted net earnings per share of approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal outlook for fiscal while worldwide economic uncertainty remains  we are encouraged by the financial results we achieved in fiscal we understand the path to economic recovery will occur at different times and at different rates across our markets and the regions of the world in which we compete 
as a result  we have taken  and continue to take  proactive measures to manage through this volatile economic environment to ensure we are positioned to drive strong financial results and gain market share throughout the recovery 
we believe the key drivers for our fiscal financial performance will include  among many others  the following main factors we intend to continue to focus on international markets to grow our revenues 
we plan to continue investing in new products designed specifically for international markets and in infrastructure around the world that will connect us more closely to international customers  increasing our global presence 
for example  during fiscal  we plan to open a new facility in eastern europe to manufacture micro irrigation products as we anticipate market demand for our water conserving products to increase in and around that geographic region  which should reduce transportation and other manufacturing costs and increase operating efficiencies 
sales in australia and asia were strong in fiscal and we expect continued growth in fiscal in those regions of the world 
a long term goal is for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
as we anticipate economic conditions in some international markets to improve  we expect our international sales to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate fiscal net sales in our professional segment to increase compared to those in fiscal  as we expect continued strong demand for our landscape contractor equipment  namely new products that we plan to introduce in fiscal together with products we introduced within the past two fiscal years  to positively impact our professional segment net sales during fiscal we also anticipate the golf market to continue to grow and sales of our golf market products to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal as we plan to continue to enhance our product offering for that market with innovative new and improved products  which should drive higher sales 
however  we expect governmental budgets to remain tight in fiscal  impacting our sales to municipalities and other governmental units 
we anticipate growth in the irrigation market for products that help conserve the use of water  namely for the commercial  residential  and agricultural markets  as the need to become more efficient in water use is expected to drive demand for our products 
we plan to invest in new products  manufacturing capacity  and infrastructure globally as products used for water conservation are expected to be a long term focus for us 
our long term goal is for water related products to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
as we anticipate a continued slow economic recovery in fiscal for residential consumers  we expect our residential segment net sales to slightly increase compared to fiscal we anticipate our broad array of new riding product offerings to continue to be well received by customers in fiscal during fiscal  we anticipate our gross margin rate to slightly increase compared to fiscal we anticipate average prices for commodities to be higher in fiscal compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal we plan to mitigate anticipated higher commodity costs by continuing to aggressively pursue cost reduction efforts 
we expect net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to be up in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven mainly by our expectation of sales growth  leveraging of sg a expense  and an improvement in our gross margin rate  as well as a reduction in our diluted shares outstanding due to anticipated repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our focus on efficient asset utilization 
we anticipate our average net working capital as a percentage of net sales in fiscal to be relatively even compared to fiscal consistent with our focus on asset management  we believe our domestic field inventory levels are currently appropriate and we anticipate field inventory levels to be approximately even as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on the global economies and the pace and degree of recovery  retail demand  field inventory levels  commodity prices  weather  competitive actions  expenses  and other factors identified in part i  item a  risk factors of this report  which could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated outlook 
results of operations fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  an increase of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings improvement were higher sales volumes  an increase in gross margin  and an increase in other income  somewhat offset by higher sg a expenses 
in addition  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  a decrease of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings decline were lower sales volumes  a decline in gross margin  and an increase in other expense  somewhat offset by lower sg a expenses 
however  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of our consolidated net sales 
fiscal years ended october net sales cost of sales gross margin sg a expense interest expense other income expense  net provision for income taxes net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
this net sales improvement was primarily driven by higher shipments of worldwide professional segment products largely resulting from improved economic conditions  a significant reduction in field inventory levels during fiscal that was not duplicated during fiscal  the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers resulting in increased sales  and additional manufacturing capacity that increased production and sales of our water conserving products for agricultural markets to meet growing worldwide demand 
an increase in residential segment net sales attributable to continued strong demand  resulting in part from customer acceptance of and additional product placement for zero turn radius riding mowers 
in addition  shipments of snow thrower products were up due to increased demand from heavy snow falls during the winter season of and the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal international net sales were also up for both our professional and residential segments due also to increased demand primarily from improved economic conditions in our key international markets and the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers  as well as a weaker average us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business that accounted for approximately million of our net sales increase 
partially offsetting those positive factors was a decline in net sales for our other segment due to the elimination of toro credit company tcc  our wholly owned financing company  floor plan interest costs resulting from the establishment of red iron acceptance llc red iron  our financing joint venture with tcf inventory finance  inc tcfif  as well as lower net sales at our wholly owned midwestern distributorship 
gross margin 
gross margin represents gross profit net sales less cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled cost of sales  for a description of expenses included in cost of sales 
gross margin increased by basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this improvement was mainly the result of the following factors a higher proportionate share of professional segment sales that carry higher average gross margins than residential segment sales 
lower manufacturing costs from higher plant utilization  mainly related to increased demand for our products 
cost reduction efforts implemented during the past two fiscal years 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were higher average prices paid for commodities in fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in our last in first out lifo reserve of million in fiscal  as compared to a reduction in our lifo reserve in fiscal that benefited our gross margin by million in fiscal an increase in freight expense due to higher fuel prices 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense increased million  or percent  from fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled selling  general  and administrative expense  for a description of expenses included in sg a expense 
sg a expense rate represents sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
sg a expense rate in fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over higher sales volumes 
the following factors increased our sg a expense an increase of million in employee incentive compensation expense as a result of improved financial performance in fiscal  as compared to fiscal higher marketing and warehousing costs of nearly million as a result of increased sales volumes 
an increase in product liability expense of million as a result of unfavorable claims experience 
somewhat offsetting those increases were costs incurred in fiscal for work force adjustments of million that were not duplicated in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal as a result of lower average debt levels 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists mainly of interest income  litigation settlements and recoveries  currency exchange rate gains and losses  equity income and losses from investments  and financing revenue 
other income for fiscal was million compared to other expense of million in fiscal this increase in other income  net was due mainly to the following factors expenses incurred in fiscal for several legal matters in the aggregate of million that were not duplicated in fiscal an increase in income from equity investments of nearly million 
somewhat offsetting those increases was a decline in financing revenue of million 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a valuation allowance recorded in fiscal of million for foreign subsidiaries net operating loss carry forwards that was not duplicated in fiscal and the favorable resolution of a transfer pricing issue 
this decrease was somewhat offset by the expiration of the domestic research tax credit on december  we anticipate our tax rate for fiscal to be lower than fiscal due to the extension of the domestic research tax credit in mid december fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
this net sales decline was primarily driven by lower shipments of domestic professional segment products largely resulting from the global recession 
a significant decline in international sales due also to reduced demand as a result of recessionary conditions affecting our key international markets  as well as a stronger average us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business that accounted for approximately million of our net sales decrease 
a slight decline in residential segment net sales by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to lower demand of riding products as a result of poor economic conditions  despite customer acceptance for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers  a decrease in electric blower product sales  and a decrease in sales of snow thrower products due to the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal lower domestic field inventory levels as of the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal as our shipments decline more than retail demand  as well as improved field inventory management 
partially offsetting those negative factors were strong shipments of walk power mowers due to additional product placement at a key retailer and a new and broader line of walk power mowers 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased by basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this decline was mainly the result of the following factors lower sales of our higher margin products 
higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production to align it with the decline in sales volumes  combined with our ongoing efforts to lower inventory levels 
a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were a reduction in our lifo reserve of million that benefited our gross margin due to a significant decline in our inventory levels 
a decline in freight expense 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense decreased million  or percent  from fiscal sg a expense rate in fiscal increased to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over significantly lower sales volumes 
the following factors decreased our sg a expense overall reduced spending in response to the worldwide recessionary economic conditions during fiscal a decline in incentive compensation expense of million due to lower than planned financial performance in fiscal offsetting those decreases were an increase in product liability costs of million as a result of unfavorable claims experience 
higher bad debt expense and costs for distributor changes of million 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal as a result of lower average short term debt levels and a decline in average interest rates 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net for fiscal was million compared to other income  net of million in fiscal this increase in other expense  net was due mainly to the following factors expenses of million in the aggregate for several legal matters 
a decline in financing revenue of million 
lower interest income of million 
somewhat offsetting those increases were foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal of million compared to foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal of million 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due to a valuation allowance of million for foreign subsidiaries net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets reflecting the uncertainty over their future realization 
this increase was partially offset by the tax impact of income from foreign jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates 
performance by business segment as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in three reportable business segments professional  residential  and distribution 
our distribution segment  which consists of our company owned domestic distributorships  has been combined with our corporate activities and is shown as other 
operating earnings for our professional and residential segments are defined as earnings from operations plus other income expense  net 
operating loss for the other segment includes earnings loss from wholly owned domestic distribution company operations  corporate activities  other income expense  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments net sales and operating results 
professional professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal  percent for fiscal  and percent for fiscal the following table shows the professional segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales   change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal primarily from higher shipments for most domestic and international product categories as a result of improved economic conditions and a significant reduction in field inventory levels during fiscal that was not duplicated in fiscal in addition  professional segment sales increased due to the following other factors higher shipments of worldwide golf maintenance equipment and irrigation systems as customers increased capital spending after delayed investments during the past two fiscal years from poor economic conditions and new golf development projects  particularly in asia  as well as the positive customer response for new products we introduced 
strong sales of landscape contractor equipment as a result of the successful introduction of new products that were well received by customers 
increased net sales of micro irrigation products due to our investments in additional manufacturing capacity that increased production of our water conserving products to meet the growing worldwide market demand 
a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
our domestic field inventory levels of our professional segment products were slightly down as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal due to continued field inventory management 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were significantly down by percent compared to fiscal primarily from lower shipments for most domestic and international product categories due to decreased demand largely as a result of the worldwide recessionary economic conditions during fiscal sales of golf maintenance equipment and irrigation systems declined as customers delayed investments in new equipment at existing golf courses and new golf course construction slowed  and sales of residential commercial irrigation systems were down as a result of weakness in the housing and commercial construction markets 
in addition  landscape contractor equipment net sales decreased  despite the fact that our new products  which included our next generation of zero turn radius riding mowers and toro grandstand stand on mowers  were well received by customers 
a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business also negatively impacted our net sales 
our domestic field inventory levels were also down as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal as our shipments declined more than retail demand  as well as improved field inventory management 
operating earnings 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted professional segment operating earnings higher gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increased sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs from increased plant utilization due to increased demand for our products  combined with our continued cost reduction efforts 
however  increased freight expense driven by higher fuel prices and rising commodity prices hampered our professional segment gross margin improvement 
a decline in sg a expense rate in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to leveraging sg a costs over higher sales volumes 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the operating profit decline was due mainly to lower gross margins as a result of higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production to align it with the decline in sales volumes  a stronger average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business  and higher tooling costs from investments in tools for new products 
a higher sg a expense rate also hampered operating earnings due mainly to fixed sg a costs spread over lower sales volumes  as well as higher product liability expense 
residential residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal and fiscal  and percent for fiscal the following table shows the residential segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following factors strong shipments of zero turn radius riding mowers attributable to continued strong demand  resulting in part from customer acceptance of new products and additional product placement 
an increase in sales of snow thrower products due to increased demand from heavy snow falls during the winter season of and the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal instead of the fourth quarter of fiscal a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were slightly down by percent compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to decreased demand primarily resulting from the global recessionary economic conditions  as well as a stronger us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
electric blower product sales were also down as a result of lost product placement at a mass retailer  and sales of snow thrower products were lower as a result of the timing of the introduction for our redesigned offering of snow thrower products that shipped to customers in the first quarter of fiscal somewhat offsetting those positive factors were increased shipments of walk power mowers as a result of additional product placement at a key retailer and a new and broader line of walk power mowers  as well as positive customer response for our new line of zero turn radius riding mowers 
operating earnings 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins improved to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors impacted residential segment operating earnings an improvement in gross margins primarily from increased sales volumes of higher margin products and the resulting effects of cost reduction efforts 
these favorable benefits were somewhat offset by higher commodity costs  an increase in freight expense  and higher manufacturing costs due to operating inefficiencies as a result of higher than anticipated customer demand 
an increase in sg a expense from higher spending for marketing  product liability  incentive compensation  and warehousing costs 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to a slight improvement in gross margins and a decline in sg a expense from lower spending for marketing  engineering  administration  and warehousing costs as a result of budget reductions 
other dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating loss net sales 
net sales for the other segment includes sales from our wholly owned domestic distribution companies less sales from the professional and residential segments to those distribution companies 
in fiscal  the other segment also included elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from tcc 
with the establishment of red iron beginning in fiscal  net sales for the other segment no longer includes corporate financing activities  including the elimination of floor plan costs from tcc  which results in lower net sales for the other segment 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal as a result of the elimination of tcc floor plan interest costs  as well as lower net sales at our wholly owned midwestern distributorship 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal due to reduced demand largely resulting from the domestic economic recession  as well as a reduction in the elimination of floor plan interest costs as a result of lower receivables with tcc and a reduction in interest rates 
operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee incentive compensation expense due to improved financial performance in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the elimination of tcc floor plan costs 
somewhat offsetting those factors was a decline in expenses incurred in fiscal for several legal matters that were not duplicated in fiscal  income from our investment in red iron  overall reduced spending from our leaner cost structure as a result of actions we implemented in fiscal  as well as elimination of costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal decreased by percent compared to fiscal this loss decrease was primarily attributable to overall reduced spending in response to the economic downturn  foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal  a decrease in incentive compensation expense  and a decline in interest expense  somewhat offset by expenses for several legal matters  an increase in bad debt expense  and higher costs for distributor changes 
financial condition working capital we have taken proactive measures to improve working capital utilization  including managing our assets  controlling costs  and adjusting production plans 
as such  our financial condition remains strong 
we continue to place emphasis on asset management  with a focus on minimizing the amount of working capital in the supply chain and maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end users 
in connection with the established of red iron  our financing joint venture with tcfif  we sold certain receivables  including floor plan and open account receivables  from most us and canadian distributors and dealers of our products at a purchase price equal to the face value of the receivables or the purchase price paid for such receivables 
red iron began financing floor plan receivables in the fourth quarter of fiscal red iron also began financing open account receivables  as well as floor plan receivables previously financed by a third party financing company  during our first quarter of fiscal the sale of these receivables enables us to use our working capital for strategic purposes  such as research and development of innovative new products  improvements in the quality and performance of existing products  strategic acquisitions and investments  and return value to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
the following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october average cash and cash equivalents average receivables  net average inventories  net average accounts payable average days outstanding for receivables average inventory turnover x x average net receivables decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average days outstanding for receivables decreased to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal due mainly to the sale of our floor plan and open account receivables to red iron during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  respectively 
average net inventories decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average inventory turnover improved by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continued our focus on improving asset management and greater than expected demand during fiscal in addition  as part of our working capital initiative  average accounts payable increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven by our supply chain initiatives and higher levels of production due to increased demand for our products 
as a result of the culmination of these efforts  in fiscal we achieved our long term goal to reduce average net working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables as a percentage of net sales at a level below percent  or to the teens 
our average net working capital as a percentage of net sales as of the end of fiscal was percent 
we expect average receivables to increase slightly and average days outstanding for receivables in fiscal to remain flat as compared to fiscal we anticipate average inventory turnover to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal as demand exceeded our expectations in fiscal resulting in lower than average inventory levels 
therefore  we expect to increase our average inventory levels in fiscal to meet anticipated higher demand for our products 
we also anticipate average accounts payable to increase slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal driven by our supply chain initiatives 
capital expenditures and other long term assets fiscal capital expenditures of million were percent higher compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to production equipment and tooling expenditures for new products  as well as investments in additional manufacturing capacity that increased production for our water conserving products 
capital expenditures for fiscal are anticipated to be approximately million as we expect to continue to invest in new product tooling  replacement production equipment  expansion of our vertical integration capabilities  as well as a new micro irrigation manufacturing facility in eastern europe 
long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   a slight increase of percent 
this increase was due primarily to the addition of intangible assets from an acquisition 
capital structure the following table details the components of our total capitalization and key ratios 
dollars in millions october short term debt long term debt  including current portion stockholders equity debt to capitalization ratio our debt to capitalization ratio was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in stockholders equity as we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production  replacement parts inventory  payroll and other administrative costs  capital expenditures  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing receivables from customers 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  bank credit lines  and cash on hand  will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating requirements 
one of the purposes of establishing red iron  our previously discussed joint venture with tcfif is to free up our working capital for strategic purposes  which may include  among other things  research and development of innovative new products  improvements in the quality and performance of existing products  strategic acquisitions and investments  and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
we believe that the funds available through existing financing arrangements and forecasted cash flows will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  debt repayments  quarterly cash dividend payments  and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
cash dividends each quarter in fiscal  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share  which was a percent increase over our cash dividend of per share paid each quarter in fiscal our board of directors recently increased our first quarter of fiscal quarterly cash dividend by percent to per share from the quarterly cash dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal cash flow cash flows provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities during the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table 
dollars in millions cash provided by used in fiscal years ended october operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net cash used provided cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end cash flows provided by operating activities 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or percent  from fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to cash received in fiscal from the initial sale of floor plan receivables to red iron and an increase in inventory levels  somewhat offset by higher net earnings and an increase in trade payables  all in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  net earnings accounted for nearly percent of our cash flows from operations  whereas in fiscal  percent of our cash flows from operations was attributable to net earnings 
cash flows used in investing activities 
capital expenditures and acquisitions are our primary uses of capital resources 
these investments are intended to enable sales growth in new markets and expand existing markets  help us to meet product demand  and increase our manufacturing efficiencies and capacity 
cash used in investing activities was up percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to an increase in purchases of property  plant  and equipment and higher amounts of cash used for acquisitions 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of funds used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal compared to fiscal credit lines and other capital resources our businesses are seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april  as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
the seasonality of production and shipments causes our working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year 
as of october   seasonal cash requirements were financed from operations and with short term financing arrangements  including our unsecured senior five year revolving credit facility that expires in january interest expense on this credit facility is determined based on a libor rate plus a basis point spread defined in the credit agreement 
we had no outstanding short term debt under this revolving credit facility as of october  and we intend to amend or replace this credit facility prior to its expiration in january in addition  our non us operations maintain unsecured short term lines of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
as of october   we had million outstanding short term debt under these lines of credit 
we also have a letter of credit subfacility as part of our credit agreement 
as of october   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit 
as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under our credit agreements 
significant financial covenants in our credit agreement during fiscal included interest coverage and debt to capitalization ratios 
on november   we amended the terms of our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility to better match our financing needs to our ongoing capital requirements 
the amendment included the following changes i replace the debt to capitalization covenant with a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda covenant that shall not exceed to for any four quarter period  ii remove language that prohibits us from repurchasing our own debt  and iii reduce the total amount of the credit line from million to million 
this amendment provides us with more flexibility in the deployment of our capital  while reducing ongoing costs to maintain the amount of credit required for ongoing operations 
we were in compliance with all prior and current covenants related to our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility as of october   and we expect to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility requires compliance with all of the covenants defined in the agreement 
if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by this credit agreement following the applicable cure period  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term senior notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our short term debt under our credit agreement 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade and or our average debt to ebitda ratio rises above to  the interest rate we currently pay on our outstanding short term debt under the credit agreement would increase 
however  the credit commitment could not be cancelled by the banks based solely on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt was unchanged during fiscal by standard and poor s ratings group at bbb and by moody s investors service at baa share repurchase plan during fiscal  we continued repurchasing shares of our common stock thereby reducing our shares outstanding 
in addition  our repurchase programs provided shares for use in connection with our equity compensation programs 
as of october    shares remained available for repurchase under our board authorization 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
this repurchase authorization has no expiration date but may be terminated by our board of directors at any time 
the following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except per share data fiscal years ended october shares of common stock purchased   cost to repurchase common stock average price paid per share we expect to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock in fiscal depending upon market conditions and our cash position 
customer financing arrangements wholesale financing 
in fiscal  we established our red iron joint venture with tcfif 
the purpose of red iron is to provide inventory financing  including floor plan and open account receivable financing  to distributors and dealers of our products in the us and to select distributors of our products in canada to enable our distributors and dealers to carry representative inventories of our products 
under a separate arrangement  during the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a program with tcfcfc to provide inventory financing to dealers of our products in canada 
under these financing arrangements  down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor and or the dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
red iron retains a security interest in the distributors and dealers financed inventories  and those inventories are monitored regularly 
floor plan terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment  which secures the indebtedness  is sold to customers  or when payment terms become due  whichever occurs first 
rates are generally indexed to libor plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
red iron purchased million of receivables from us during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  some independent international dealers continue to finance their products with third party sources 
these third party financing companies purchased million of receivables from us during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies and red iron for receivables financed by third party financing companies and red iron 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to a maximum amount of million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies over the past three fiscal years 
however  a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we continue to provide inventory financing to home centers and mass retailers  general line irrigation dealers  international distributors and dealers other than the canadian distributors and dealers to whom red iron provides financing arrangements  and government customers 
end user financing 
we have agreements with third party financing companies to provide lease financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers in the us and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
during fiscal  we entered into an amended agreement with a third party financing company that eliminated our contingent liability for any residual value risk on the underlying equipment financed under this program 
in addition  under the terms of the amended agreement  we are only contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection risk for leases entered into prior to the effective date of the amended agreement 
from time to time  we enter into agreements where we provide recourse to the third party finance company in the event of default by the customer for lease payments to the third party finance company 
our maximum exposure for credit collection as of october  was million 
termination or any material change to the terms of our end user financing arrangements  availability of credit for our customers  including any delay in securing replacement credit sources  or significant financed product repurchase requirements could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results 
distributor financing 
from time to time  we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or facilitation of ownership changes 
as of october  and  we had outstanding notes receivable in the aggregate of million and million  respectively  from two distribution companies 
the amounts are included in other current and long term assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligation less than year years years more than years total long term debt short term debt interest payments deferred compensation arrangements purchase obligations operating leases total principal payments under our lines of credit 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements  covering certain current and retired management employees  consists primarily of salary and bonus deferrals under our deferred compensation plans 
our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant elections 
deferred compensation balances are invested according to the election of the participant in an array of funds that is substantially similar to the array of funds offered under the toro company investment  savings and employee stock ownership plan  and are payable at the election of the participant 
operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance 
as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we may be obligated for additional cash outflows of million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the payment and timing of any such payments is affected by the ultimate resolution of the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
market risk due to the nature and scope of our operations  we are subject to exposures that arise from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
additional information is presented in part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation  deflation  and changing prices 
during fiscal  we experienced higher average commodity costs compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal  particularly in the second half of fiscal  which hampered our gross margin growth rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal we will continue to closely follow the commodities that affect our product lines  and we anticipate average prices paid for commodities to be higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect to mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures by engaging in proactive vendor negotiations  reviewing alternative sourcing options  substituting materials  engaging in internal cost reduction efforts  and increasing prices on some of our products  all as appropriate 
acquisitions and divestiture on april   we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from uspraxis  inc  a manufacturer of stump grinders  wood chippers  and log splitters for rental centers and landscape professionals 
the addition of these products broadens and strengthens our equipment solutions for the rental and landscape markets 
on october   we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of one of our independent us western based distributorships 
during the first quarter of fiscal  our wholly owned domestic distribution company also completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of one of our independent us midwestern based distribution companies 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we also completed the sale of a portion of the operations of our company owned distributorship 
in fiscal  we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of ty crop manufacturing ltd  a leading manufacturer of topdressing and material handling equipment for golf course and sports fields applications 
the acquisition of ty crop s topdressing and material handling equipment enhanced our product offering of application and cultivation equipment to help customers achieve improved agronomic conditions of turf 
in fiscal  we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of southern green  inc  a leading manufacturer of deep tine aeration equipment 
the acquisition of southern green s versatile line of soil reliever aerators increased our offering of highly productive turf cultivation equipment and provided entry into a new product category for our golf course and sports field markets 
in fiscal  we also completed the purchase of turf guard wireless monitoring technology from jlh labs  llc  a leader in wireless soil monitoring technology 
the turf guard system is designed to measure soil moisture  salinity  and temperature through buried wireless sensors that communicate data to an internet server for processing and presentation to a user through the web 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following warranty reserve 
warranty coverage on our products is for specified periods of time and on select products hours of usage  and generally covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs 
warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty reserve by product line for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims 
we also establish reserves for major rework campaigns 
the amount of our warranty reserves is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty  historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims  the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation due to such factors as performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims  our actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
an unexpected increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accrual and a decrease in our net earnings 
sales promotions and incentives 
at the time of sale to a customer  we record an estimate for sales promotion and incentive costs which are classified as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of sg a expense 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include rebate programs on certain professional products sold to distributors  volume discounts  retail financing support  floor planning  cooperative advertising  commissions  and other sales discounts and promotional programs 
the estimates for sales promotion and incentive costs are based on the terms of the arrangements with customers  historical payment experience  field inventory levels  volume purchases  and expectations for changes in relevant trends in the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates if competitive factors dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive accruals or if customer usage and field inventory levels vary from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentive accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of the cost of inventory or net realizable value  with cost determined by either the lifo method for most us inventories or the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
we establish reserves for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life  and forecasted sales demand 
valuation of inventory can also be affected by significant redesign of existing products or replacement of an existing product by an entirely new generation product 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  competitive factors  and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our manufacturing production accordingly 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded based on historical loss trends  ongoing cycle count and periodic testing adjustments  and inventory levels 
though management considers reserve balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have an effect on the reserve balances required 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we value accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
each fiscal quarter  we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable 
we believe that an analysis of historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to sg a expense in the period that we made such a determination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
see further discussions on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency exchange rate market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the primary use of forward currency contracts 
we use derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes and not for trading purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  foreign plant operations  and purchases from suppliers 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states and mexico  a stronger us dollar and mexican peso generally has a negative impact on our results from operations  while a weaker dollar and peso generally has a positive effect 
our primary currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the mexican peso  and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in market values of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
further information regarding gains and losses on our derivative instruments is presented in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal and all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet the cash flow hedging criteria  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other income expense  net as of and for the fiscal year ended october  were as follows dollars in thousands except average contracted rate average contracted rate notional amount value in aocl income loss fair value impact loss gain buy us sell canadian dollar buy us sell australian dollar buy us sell euro buy us sell british pound buy mexican peso sell us buy romanian new lei sell euro our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  and would not impact net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to libor based short term debt from commercial banks  as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
we generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant  including the average balance of short term debt outstanding during fiscal  interest expense would have increased thousand in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying amount of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts and terms of debt could currently be borrowed 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into three treasury lock agreements based on a year us treasury security with a principal balance of million for two of the agreements and million for the third agreement 
these treasury lock agreements provided for a single payment at maturity  which was april   based on the change in value of the reference treasury security 
these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and resulted in a net settlement of million 
this loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and will be amortized to interest expense over the year term of the senior notes 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  aluminum  fuel  petroleum based resin  and linerboard 
in addition  we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  copper  lead  rubber  and others which are integrated into our end products 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
further information regarding rising prices for commodities is presented in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report in the section entitled inflation 
we enter into fixed price contracts for future purchases of natural gas in the normal course of operations as a means to manage natural gas price risks 
our manufacturing facilities enter into these fixed price contracts for approximately to percent of their monthly anticipated usage 
equity price risk 
the trading price volatility of toro common stock impacts compensation expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
further information is presented in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements regarding our stock based compensation plans
