item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenue in was million  a decline  compared with in response to the decline in revenue  we reduced our research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  collectively  by  primarily through reductions in headcount  marketing expenses and number of facilities and renegotiation of vendor contracts 
as a result  we ended the year with an increase of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments over the global economic slowdown adversely affected our business in as consumers reduced their spending on discretionary items  such as our digital entertainment products and services  and businesses reduced their investment in technology and online advertising 
the economic downturn caused declines in consumer access to credit  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  declines in the value of assets and increased liquidity risks  all of which adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
weakness in online advertising purchases by companies affected advertising revenue in all of our consumer businesses 
our tps business was slightly less affected by the global recession than our consumer businesses due to the multiyear contractual duration of the saas services we provide to mobile carriers 
however  reported revenue declined principally due to foreign exchange rate changes 
during the year  we signed a number of new business contracts  both with new mobile carrier customers and with existing partners to provide additional saas services 
we believe that our competitiveness in the mobile carrier saas business was enhanced by our strong balance sheet compared with some of our competitors  as well as by the breadth of offerings we are able to bring to the carriers as a single provider 
during  sales of media player licenses to handset manufacturers and licenses of our helix server software declined as a result of lower mobile handset sales to consumers and the reduction in technology investment by companies  government and educational institutions 
in our mss segment  subscription revenue in our superpass business continued to decline 
we also renegotiated an agreement with a major partner thereby maintaining our revenue from the distribution of third party products  which is a significant and profitable revenue stream for us 
we also introduced a new version of our realplayer media player software that increased the number of opportunities to offer partner downloads 
in addition  we incurred significantly higher product development and litigation costs within our mss segment in compared with in our games segment  some of our competitors increased their focus on games that are inexpensive to produce  which put pressure on prices for downloadable and online games 
we sold more games in than in previous years  but we lowered prices of our downloadable games in response to competitive pressure  resulting in lower revenue from sales of games licenses 
our new games subscription offering  called funpass  drew an increased number of subscribers  but subscription revenue increases were not large enough to make up for the declines in license sales and advertising revenue 
our games segment also made progress in 
table of contents integrating the acquisitions of the past five years and in consolidating the realarcade and gamehouse platforms to reduce costs and simplify the business in the us in our music segment  revenue for the year was flat despite the fact that competition increased in the form of new and increased awareness and popularity of advertising supported free music offerings and lower priced subscription offerings 
meanwhile  royalty rates we paid to the music labels did not decline to reflect the lower price environment  significantly limiting our ability to lower our prices 
in addition  the slowdown in purchases of mobile handsets by consumers reduced the number of new sign ups for our subscription music services through our partner verizon wireless 
in response  our music segment reduced people and marketing related costs significantly in the year 
in addition  we introduced rhapsody music applications for the iphone and android based devices to increase distribution and marketing opportunities in the future

in addition  we intend to focus in on implementing strategic initiatives that include the separation of our music and games businesses  which is described in item of this report under overview 
following the completion of the restructuring of rhapsody america  which is expected to occur at the end of the first quarter of  we expect we will no longer consolidate rhapsody america s financial results with our consolidated financial statements  which will result in lower overall reported revenue 
in conjunction with the separation of our music and games businesses  we expect to reduce our overall operating costs and potentially to record cash and non cash charges associated with restructuring 
whether and to what extent we realize any benefits from the separation of our music and games businesses or from rationalizing our operating cost structure following the separation of these businesses are subject to risks that are described in 
table of contents item a of this report under risks related to our media software and services  games and music businesses and risks related to our business in general 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  estimating music publishing rights and music royalties  estimating recoverability of deferred costs  estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating losses on excess office facilities  determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary and estimating fair market value of investments in privately held companies  valuation of long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  stock based compensation  noncontrolling interest  accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
physical products are considered delivered to the customer once they have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for online sales  the products or services are considered delivered at the time the product or services are made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis 
in most arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectability risk 
in such arrangements  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectability risk 
in such instances  we recognize revenue on a net basis 
in our direct to consumer business segments  which include music  games and mss  we derive revenue through subscriptions  sales of content downloads  software and licenses and the sale of advertising and the distribution of third party products on our websites and in our games 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual duration 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription time period 
revenue from sales of content downloads  software and licenses is recognized at the time the product is made available  digitally  to the end user 
revenue generated from advertising on our websites and from advertising and the distribution of third party products included in our products is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery 
our business to business tps segment generates revenue by providing services that enable wireless carriers to deliver audio and video content to their customers and through sales of software licenses and products and related support and other services 

table of contents revenue generated from services provided to wireless carriers that enable the delivery of audio and video content to their customers is recognized as the services are provided 
setup fees to build these services are recognized ratably upon launch of the service over the remaining expected term of the service 
a portion of the revenue related to the sale of software licenses and products and related support and other services is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including  in some cases  post delivery support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis 
the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method 
unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the related products life cycles 
estimating music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services 
material differences may impact the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimating recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 
we recognize such costs as a component of cost of goods sold in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make estimates of the uncollectible portion of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates or actual future experience was different from the judgments and estimates 
estimating losses on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we made different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
our original estimate has been revised in previous periods in response to changes in 
table of contents market conditions for commercial real estate in the area where the excess office facilities are located  or to reflect negotiated changes in sublease rates charged to occupying tenants 
impairment of investments 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in the fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
significant judgments and estimates are made to assess whether an other than temporary decline in fair value of investments has occurred and to estimate the fair value of investments in privately held companies 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of any impairment charge if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates or actual future experience was different from the judgments and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortizable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
long lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  and their resulting impact on the estimates and assumptions relating to the value of our long lived assets could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future interim periods which could result in a significant impairment 
while we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  due to their complexity and subjectivity  these estimates and assumptions could vary period to period 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
we consider a synthesis of the following important factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  market and interest rate risk  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
in addition  we perform a reconciliation of our market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium to the aggregated implied fair value of all of our reporting units 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
judgment is required in determining our reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units 
the impairment analysis of goodwill is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and 
table of contents assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
noncontrolling interests 
we record noncontrolling interest expense benefit which reflects the portion of the earnings losses of majority owned entities which are applicable to the noncontrolling interest partners in the consolidated statement of operations 
redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either fair value or are based on a formula that is intended to approximate fair value follow our historical disclosure only policy for the redemption feature 
redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either a fixed price or are based on a formula that is not akin to fair value are reflected as an adjustment to income attributable to common shareholders based on the difference between accretion as calculated using the terms of the redemption feature and the accretion entry for a hypothetical fair value redemption feature with the remaining amount of accretion to redemption value recorded directly to equity 
noncontrolling interest expense benefit is included within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
as of december   and  our noncontrolling interests solely related to redeemable noncontrolling interest in rhapsody america 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest treatment 
accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment to arb no 
sfas which was primarily codified into fasb asc consolidation asc 
current guidance requires the difference between the carrying amount of the parent s investment in a subsidiary and the underlying net book value of the subsidiary after the issuance of stock by the subsidiary to be recorded as equity transactions 
we elected to recognize any such gain in our consolidated statement of operations prior to january  as was allowable under generally accepted accounting principles in place at that time if certain recognition criteria were met 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance 
table of contents result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to  past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes or withholding taxes on certain non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside of the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the availability of foreign tax credits and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
we file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal  state  local  and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to united states federal  state  local  or foreign income tax examinations for years before we are currently subject to united states federal and various state audits for certain tax years subsequent to

impairment of deferred costs and prepaid royalties we assess the recovery of all deferred project costs and any royalty advances paid to content providers on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we determined that the total estimated costs associated with certain projects exceeded the total estimated revenues expected to be recognized on those projects 
as a result  we impaired approximately million in deferred project costs 
in addition  we assessed the recovery of recoupable royalty advances paid to certain content providers 
as of december   we determined that approximately million in royalty advances was not recoverable and therefore charged to expense 
the total impairment of deferred costs and prepaid royalties was mentioned throughout the section above entitled cost of revenue by segment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information 
no such charges existed in or assessing the recoverability of deferred project costs and prepaid royalty advances is based on significant assumptions and estimates  including future revenue and cost of sales 
significant or sustained decreases in revenue or increases in cost of sales in future periods could result in additional impairments of deferred project costs and prepaid royalty advances 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such impairments 
should the value of deferred project costs or prepaid royalty advances become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  expense associated with stock based compensation  and consulting fees associated with product development

impairment of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and if an event or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during our fiscal fourth quarter 
a two step process is used to test for goodwill impairment 
the first step is to determine if there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including existing goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
upon an indication of impairment from the first step  a second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment 
this involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing it to the carrying amount of goodwill 
we have four reporting units  music  technology products and solutions  games  and media software and services 
we determined that a triggering event had occurred during the quarter ended june   warranting an interim impairment analysis of goodwill 
during the impairment analysis  we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero for each of our reporting units 
as a result  the music  tps  games  and mss reporting units recorded impairments of million  million  million and million  respectively  during the quarter ended june  no other impairments of goodwill and long lived assets were recorded in as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended december   we determined that the carrying value for our games and tps reporting units exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that goodwill within each reporting unit was potentially impaired 
no impairments were indicated under the first step for our music and mss reporting units 
as required  we initiated the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our games and tps reporting units 
we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill for our tps and games reporting units was less than the carrying value by approximately million and million  respectively  which was recorded as an impairment of goodwill during the quarter ended december  no impairments were recognized in the year ended december  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including operating and cash flow projections 
we determined that the net book value related to certain intangible assets exceeded the fair value attributable to such intangible assets as of december  as a result  we recorded charges of million as impairments of long lived assets within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in no such impairments were recognized in either or the impairment analysis for goodwill and long lived assets is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
significant or sustained declines in 
table of contents future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under sfas no 
and asc and  respectively in future periods 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or long lived assets 
should the value of our goodwill or long lived assets become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring and other charges during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges were a result of workforce reductions 
severance charges accounted for a majority of the amount recorded

loss on excess office facilities the accrued loss of million for estimated future losses on excess office facilities located near our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington at december   is shown net of expected future sublease income of million  which was committed under sublease contracts at the time of the estimate

income taxes during the years ended december    and  we recognized income tax expense of million  million  and million  respectively  related to us and foreign income taxes 
the decrease of million in tax expense from the year ended december   to was primarily due to the smaller increase in valuation allowance in compared to the decrease of million in tax expense from the year ended december   to was primarily due to the impairments of long lived assets  deferred costs and prepaid royalties incurred in as well as the change in income generated from the microsoft settlement offset by an increase in tax expense due to the change in the valuation allowance 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
in making this assessment  many factors are considered including the current economic climate  our expectations of future taxable income  our ability to project such income  and the appreciation of our investments and other assets 
as of december   we have a valuation allowance of million

our principal commitments include office leases and contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio 
we conduct our operations primarily in five functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound and the euro 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except in korea  japan  germany  france  the united kingdom and australia  where we invoice our customers primarily in won  yen  euros  pounds  and australian dollars  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
all statements that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of high quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity and the substantial majority of our short term investments mature within one year of purchase  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents at december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million

as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale  carried at current market value and are classified as long term as they are strategic in nature 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
for investments in private companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during the years ended december   and  we determined that no additional other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred and therefore no impairment charges were recorded 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the remeasurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
a portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency swaps 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
some of our unhedged exposures are reconciled through our statement of operations on a mark to market basis each quarter  so to the extent we continue to experience adverse economic conditions  we may record losses related to such unhedged exposures in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
in aggregate  our foreign currency denominated assets are greater than our foreign currency denominated liabilities 
primarily as a result of the us dollar strengthening against the korean won and euros in  we recorded a reduction to our reported net assets of approximately million as reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  during the year ended december   we recorded an increase to our reported net assets of approximately million as a result of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  we have cash balances denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash is held in korean won and euros 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the korean won and euro relative to the us dollar from december  would result in an unrealized gain or loss of approximately million 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for the years ended december    and
