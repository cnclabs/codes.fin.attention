table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a limited number of clients and provide services to few industries 
in  approximately of our total revenues came from two clients 
we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in  our two largest clients  centrica and travelers  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we generated of our total revenues in from centrica and of our total revenues in from travelers 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that expires in april centrica has the option to extend the contract for two annual extension periods 
this contract can be terminated by centrica without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee 
we provide services to travelers under a services agreement and work assignments and orders generated thereunder 
although the services agreement does not have a fixed term  the work assignments and work orders expire in december and renew every year thereafter unless either party elects not to renew within a specified period before the next renewal date 
travelers may terminate the services agreement  or any work assignment or work order  without cause upon days prior notice 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients in the near future 
the loss or financial difficulties of either of our large clients would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the impact of the ongoing global economic downturn could negatively affect our business in multiple ways 
the ongoing global economic downturn has adversely impacted companies in the industries to which we provide services including the banking  financial services and insurance industries 
a substantial portion of our clients are concentrated in the insurance and utilities industry 
in  of our total revenues were derived from clients in those industries  including of our total revenues that were derived from clients in the insurance industry 
our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients and potential clients in these industries 
adverse developments in these industries could further unfavorably affect our business 
other developments  such as consolidations  restructurings or reorganizations  particularly involving our clients  could also cause the demand for our services in these industries to decline 
we currently derive  and are likely to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from clients located in the united states 
since the end of  the united states economy has been in a recession and undergoing a period of substantial economic uncertainty  resulting in credit market dislocations  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment 
a continuing deterioration in economic activity in the united states could adversely affect demand for our services  thus reducing our revenues 
in addition  the decrease in the general level of economic activity  such as decreases in business and consumer spending  could result in a decrease in demand for our services  particularly our transformation services  thus reducing our revenue 
the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our clients 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to access financing or increase our cost of financing to meet liquidity needs  and affect the ability of our customers to use credit to purchase our services or to make timely payments to us  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
if macroeconomic conditions worsen  we may not be able to predict the impact such worsening conditions will have on our targeted industries in general  and our results of operations specifically 
our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the united states and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
we have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future developments in the market for outsourcing services 
for example  we believe that there will continue to be 
table of contents changes in product and service requirements  and investments in the products offered by our clients will continue to increase 
however  the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
offshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the united states and elsewhere  and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the united states and elsewhere 
in addition  there has been limited publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing  particularly in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate out of facilities located in the united states and elsewhere 
a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that  if enacted  could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the united states 
for example  legislation has been proposed that would require offshore providers to identify where they are located and that would require notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to non us companies 
because most of our clients are located in the united states  any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could adversely impact our ability to do business with us clients and have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  it is possible that legislation could be adopted that would restrict us private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts or financing from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers 
such restrictions could affect our ability to attract or retain clients that have such contracts in the future 
in other countries  such as the united kingdom  which comprised of our total revenues in  there has also been some negative publicity and concern expressed regarding the possible effect of job losses caused by outsourcing 
legislation introduced in the united kingdom consolidating past case law in provides that if a company transfers or outsources its business or a part of its business to a transferee or a service provider  the employees who were employed in such business are entitled to become employed by the transferee or service provider on the same terms and conditions as they had been employed before the transfer 
the dismissal of such employees as a result of such transfer of business is deemed unfair dismissal and entitles the employees to compensation 
as a result  we may become liable for redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the united kingdom who outsource business to us 
we are generally indemnified in our existing contracts with clients in the united kingdom to the extent we incur losses or additional costs due to the application of this legislation to us  and we intend to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients 
however  if we are unable to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients  we may be liable under any agreements we enter into in the future with united kingdom clients 
similar legislations has also been enacted in certain other european jurisdictions 
our client contracts contain certain termination and other provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
most of our client contracts may be terminated by our clients without cause and do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
any failure to meet a client s expectations could result in a cancellation or non renewal of a contract or a decrease in business provided to us 
we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us  which would reduce our revenues 
for example  we provide services to centrica under an agreement that can be terminated by centrica without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee and we provide services to travelers under a services agreement that travelers may terminate without cause upon days prior notice 
we generated of our total revenues in from centrica and of our total revenues in from travelers 
the termination of either of these contracts with or without cause could have a material adverse impact on the predictability of our expected revenue stream 
a limited number of our contracts allow a client  in certain limited circumstances  to request a benchmark study comparing our pricing and performance with that of an agreed list of other service providers for 
table of contents comparable services 
based on the results of the study and depending on the reasons for any unfavorable variance  we may be required to make improvements in the services we provide or reduce the pricing for services on a prospective basis to be performed under the remaining term of the contract or our client could elect to terminate the contract  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our contracts contain provisions that would require us to pay penalties to our clients and or provide our clients with the right to terminate the contract if we do not meet pre agreed service level requirements or if we do not provide certain productivity benefits 
failure to meet these requirements or accurately estimate the productivity benefits could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our contracts with clients specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the contract  the client has the right to terminate the contract 
these provisions may result in our contracts being terminated if there is such a change in control  resulting in a potential loss of revenues 
in addition  these provisions may act as a deterrent to any attempt by a third party to acquire our company 
we may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates 
the bpo industry is very labor intensive and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees  including our ability to attract employees with needed skills in the geographic areas in which we operate 
the industry  including us  experiences high employee turnover 
in  our turnover rate for billable employees was approximately 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
increased competition for these professionals  in the bpo industry or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on us 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to provide bpo services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins  and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 
high turnover rates generally do not impact our revenues as we factor the attrition rate into our pricing models by maintaining additional employees for each process 
however  high turnover rates do increase our cost of revenues and therefore impact our profit margins due to higher recruitment  training and retention costs as a result of maintaining larger hiring  training and human resources departments and higher operating costs due to having to reallocate certain business processes among our operations centers where we have access to the skilled workforce needed for the business 
in  we incurred approximately million on recruitment and approximately million on training costs due to employee turnover  thereby increasing our costs and reducing our profit margins for that period by million 
in addition  our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract  train and retain personnel with skills that keep pace with the demand for outsourcing  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
a lack of sufficiently qualified personnel could also inhibit our ability to establish operations in new markets and our efforts to expand geographically 
our failure to attract  train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services  which requires significant investment of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them 
therefore  our selling cycle  which generally ranges from six to eighteen months  is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients decision to 
table of contents choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or in house offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete 
implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby delaying further the implementation process 
our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services  and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
once we are engaged by a client  it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues 
when we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our bpo services  it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the client s systems with ours  and up to three months thereafter to build up our services to the client s requirements 
depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented  these time periods may be significantly longer 
implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle 
therefore  we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase 
we enter into long term contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to estimate the resources and time required for our contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the initial terms of our bpo client contracts typically range from three to five years 
in many of our bpo contracts we commit to long term pricing with our clients and therefore bear the risk of cost overruns  completion delays  wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a contract  future wage inflation rates or currency exchange rates or fail to accurately hedge our currency exchange rate exposure or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe  our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 
consistency in our revenues from period to period depends in part on our ability to reflect the changing demands and needs of our existing and potential bpo clients 
if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our bpo clients and potential bpo clients  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
most of our bpo contracts use a pricing model that provides for hourly or annual billing rates 
industry pricing models are evolving  however  and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction based pricing 
this pricing model will place additional pressure on the efficiency of our service delivery so that we can maintain reasonable operating margins 
if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols  our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors 
in addition  the bpo services we provide to our clients and the revenues and income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
furthermore  our clients  some of which have experienced significant and adverse changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability  have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions  automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in house or to other providers  any of which could reduce our profitability 
any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients  or any requirement to lower our prices  would harm our business 

table of contents our transformation services are cyclical and based on specific projects involving short term contracts 
our transformation services  such as our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services  are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
changes in the deadlines or the scope of work required for compliance with the requirements of legislation applicable to our clients could have a significant impact on certain service offerings of our risk and financial management services business 
in addition  a majority of our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
our operating results may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult for us to make accurate financial forecasts 
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
although our existing agreements with original terms of three or more years provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
the timing of revenue recognition under new client agreements also varies depending on when we complete the implementation phase 
the completion of implementation varies significantly based upon the complexity of the processes being implemented 
our period to period results have in the past and may also in the future fluctuate due to other factors  including client losses  delays or failure by our clients to provide anticipated business  variations in employee utilization rates resulting from changes in our clients operations  delays or difficulties in expanding our operations centers and infrastructure including hiring new employees or constructing new operations centers  changes to our pricing structure or that of our competitors  currency fluctuation  seasonal changes in the operations of our clients and other events identified in this annual report on form k 
our revenues are also affected by changes in pricing under our contracts at the time of renewal or by pricing under new contracts 
for example  because the majority of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling or uk dollars while most of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees and the philippine peso  our revenues can decrease or increase significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
in addition  some of our contracts do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
these factors may make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays in implementing our services or client losses 
if our actual results do not meet any estimated results that we announce  or if we underperform market expectations as a result of such factors  trading prices for our common stock could be adversely affected 
our senior management team is critical to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management team and other key employees possessing technical and business capabilities  including industry expertise  that are difficult to replace 
specifically  the loss of the services of our executive chairman  vikram talwar  or of our president and chief executive officer  rohit kapoor  could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business 
there is intense competition for experienced senior management and personnel with technical and industry expertise in the industry in which we operate  and we may not be able to retain these officers or key employees 
although we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with all of our executive officers  certain terms of those agreements may not be enforceable and in any event these agreements do not ensure the continued service of these executive officers 
messrs 
talwar and kapoor and certain of their affiliates have certain registration rights with respect to their shares of common stock 

table of contents in addition  we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team 
the loss of any of our key employees  particularly to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our inability to effectively manage our rapid infrastructure and personnel growth could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations and financial condition 
since we were founded in april  we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations 
we have ten operations centers in india  one in the philippines and one in the czech republic 
our headcount has increased from approximately  on december  to approximately  including personnel managed under structured client service agreements on december  we expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated growth of our business 
we are in the process of establishing new operation centers in romania and india and are also continuing to look for operation centers at additional locations outside of india and the philippines 
we believe expanding our geographic base of operations will provide higher value to our clients by decreasing the risks of operating from a single country including potential shortages of skilled employees  increases in wage costs during strong economic times and currency fluctuations  while also giving our clients access to a wider talent pool and establishing a base in countries that may be competitive in the future 
however  we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and employee expansion  open additional operations centers or hire additional skilled employees as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our clients  and we may not be able to develop and improve our internal systems 
our inability to execute our growth strategy  to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to selectively consider acquisitions or investments  some of which may be material 
through the acquisitions we pursue  we may seek opportunities to expand the scope of our existing services we provide  add new clients or to enter new geographic markets 
we have made acquisitions in the past  including our acquisition in of the back office operations of schneider sro in the czech republic and our acquisition in of the american express global travel services center located in gurgaon  india 
there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates in the future for strategic transactions at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to accomplish our strategy or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions 
acquisitions  including completed acquisitions  also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations 
we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems  including problems related to execution or integration 
following the completion of an acquisition  we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support  including financial reporting and internal controls  to the acquired business for a period of time 
there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 
if more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects employee interests  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
though we are exempt from some of these labor laws at present under exceptions in some states for providers of it enabled services  there can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable to us in the future 
if these labor laws become applicable to our employees  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies and attract and employ the numbers of sufficiently qualified candidates that we need or discharge employees  and our compensation expenses may increase significantly 

table of contents in addition  our employees may in the future form unions 
if employees at any of our operations centers become eligible for union membership  we may be required to raise wage levels or grant other benefits that could result in an increase in our compensation expenses  in which case our profitability may be adversely affected 
employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees 
for example  wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of our competitive advantages 
however  because of rapid economic growth in india  increased demand for bpo services from india and increased competition for skilled employees in india  wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states and europe  which may reduce this competitive advantage 
we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires 
wages are generally higher for employees performing decision analytics services and risk and financial management services than for employees performing bpo services 
as the scale of our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services increases  wages as a percentage of revenues will likely increase 
to the extent that we are not able to control or share wage increases with our clients  wage increases may reduce our margins 
we will attempt to control such costs by our efforts to add capacity in locations where we consider wage levels of skilled personnel to be satisfactory  but we may not be successful in doing so 
additionally  because a majority of our employees are based in india and paid in indian rupees  while our revenues are primarily in us dollars and us pounds sterling  our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
we face significant competition from us based and us based outsourcing and information technology companies and from our clients  who may perform outsourcing services themselves  either in house  in the united states or through offshore groups or other arrangements 
the market for outsourcing services is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify and increase from a number of sources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth and depth of process expertise  service quality  the ability to attract  train and retain qualified people  compliance rigor  global delivery capabilities  price  knowledge of industries served and marketing and sales capabilities 
we also face competition from non us based outsourcing and it companies including those in the united kingdom and india and us based outsourcing and it companies 
in addition  the trend toward offshore outsourcing  international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes will result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
these competitors may include entrants from the communications  software and data networking industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate 
some of these existing and future competitors have greater financial  personnel and other resources  a broader range of service offerings  greater technological expertise  more recognizable brand names and more established relationships in industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future 
in addition  some of our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger  more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs  or enter into similar arrangements with potential clients 
the trend in multi vendor relationships has been growing  which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other vendors 
increased competition  our inability to compete successfully against competitors  pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as more companies enter our markets 
increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes  higher costs for resources  especially people  and lower profitability 
we may not be able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors 
any inability to compete effectively would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may disrupt our clients operations as a result of inadequate service or other factors  including telecommunications or technology downtime or interruptions 
the services we provide are often critical to our clients businesses  and any failure to provide those services could result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure 
most of our agreements with clients contain service level and performance requirements  including requirements relating to the quality of our services 
failure to consistently meet service requirements of a client or errors made by our employees in the course of delivering services to our clients could disrupt the client s business and result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for damages against us 
additionally  we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal control failures or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 
under a majority of our agreements with our clients  our liability for breach of certain of our obligations is generally limited to actual damages suffered by the client and is typically capped at the greater of an agreed amount or the fees paid or payable to us for a period of time under the relevant agreement 
these limitations and caps on liability may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients or liability for breaches of confidentiality  are generally not limited under those agreements 
our agreements are governed by laws of multiple jurisdictions  therefore the interpretation of such provisions  and the availability of defenses to us  may vary  which may contribute to the uncertainty as to the scope of our potential liability 
our dependence on our offshore operations centers requires us to maintain active voice and data communications among our operations centers in india and the philippines  our international technology hubs in the united states and our clients offices 
although we maintain redundant facilities and communications links  disruptions could result from  among other things  technical breakdowns  computer glitches and viruses and weather conditions 
we also depend on certain significant vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at those technology hubs 
any failure by these vendors to perform those services  any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems  or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients  have a negative impact on our reputation  cause us to lose clients  reduce our revenues and harm our business 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we do not protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others 
our success depends in part on certain methodologies  practices  tools and technical expertise we utilize in designing  developing  implementing and maintaining applications and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
in order to protect our rights in these various intellectual properties  we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret  copyright and trademark laws 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  clients and potential clients and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we also have submitted united states federal and foreign trademark applications for the names of additional service offerings 
we may not be successful in maintaining or obtaining trademarks for these trade names 
india is a member of the berne convention  an international intellectual property treaty  and has agreed to recognize protections on intellectual property rights conferred under the laws of other foreign countries  including the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the laws  rules  regulations and treaties in effect in the united states  india and the other jurisdictions in which we operate and the contractual and other protective measures we take  are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property  or that such laws will not change 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights  and any such steps may not be successful 
infringement by others of our intellectual property  including the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we believe that we are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  claims may nonetheless be successfully asserted against us in the future 
the costs of defending any such claims could be 
table of contents significant  and any successful claim may require us to modify  discontinue or rename any of our services 
any such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients 
we are typically required to collect and store sensitive data in connection with our services  including names  addresses  social security numbers  credit card account numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
in addition  many of our agreements with our clients do not include any limitation on our liability to them with respect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential 
we take precautions to protect confidential client and customer data 
however  if any person  including any of our employees  penetrates our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data  we could be subject to significant liability and lawsuits from our clients or their own customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws 
penetration of the network security of our data centers could have a negative impact on our reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may not be fully insured for all losses we may incur 
although we attempt to limit and mitigate our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors or omissions through contractual provisions  limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients  are generally not limited under those agreements 
although we have general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  property damage or loss and breaches of privacy and network security  that coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or to be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
oak hill capital partners and its affiliates  vikram talwar and rohit kapoor exercise significant influence over us  and their interests in our business may be different than yours 
a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock are currently beneficially owned by oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates  our executive chairman  vikram talwar  and our president and chief executive officer  rohit kapoor 
as of december   oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  mr 
talwar and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  and mr 
kapoor and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  each of these parties can exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs and all matters requiring a stockholders vote  including the composition of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with your interests 
we may not succeed in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or integrating an acquired business into our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
one of our strategies is to broaden our geographic presence  gain new clients  enter new streams of services and expand capacity both organically and through strategic acquisitions 
we may not  however  succeed in 
table of contents identifying suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions or be able to consummate any acquisition 
our management may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or maintain our standards  controls and policies  and any acquisition we do complete may not result in long term benefits to us 
acquisitions involve a number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms  failure to retain key personnel  legal liabilities and the need to amortize acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we may choose to expand operations to additional countries and may not be successful in maintaining our current profit margins in our new locations due to factors beyond our control 
we are currently continuing to evaluate additional locations other than india  the philippines  the czech republic and romania in which to invest in an operations center 
we cannot predict the extent of government support  availability of qualified workers  or monetary and economic conditions in other countries 
although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country  there are inherent risks beyond our control  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political uncertainties  foreign exchange restrictions and foreign regulatory restrictions 
one or more of these factors or other factors relating to expanded international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations  which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results 
we may increase the range of services that we provide to our clients and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we are exploring opportunities to provide outsourced services that we have not provided to date 
should we decide to expand our service offerings  our results of operations may be negatively affected during any transition or growth period before such offerings achieve profitability 
for example  we may need to expand our training of our existing employees or recruit new  specially trained employees to provide these services  which could increase our costs of revenues disproportionately to the revenues generated by such services 
other challenges we may face include attracting and retaining clients for such services  integrating any new services into our current suite of services and managing any resulting growth in our operations 
failure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations 
our clients are often subject to regulations that may require that we comply with certain rules and regulations in performing services for them that would not otherwise apply to us 
debt collection services  for example  may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act  which regulates debt collection practices 
in addition  many us states require a debt collector to apply for  be granted and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities in a state 
we are currently licensed or exempt from licensing requirements to provide debt collection services in the united states from india in all but two us states and from the philippines in us states that have non exempt requirements and have separate conditional exemptions with respect to our ongoing collection obligations 
other us federal laws and regulations that apply to certain portions of our business include the fair credit reporting act  the gramm leach bliley act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act and the fdic rules and regulations 
if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services  we may not be able to provide services to existing customers or be able to attract new clients and could lose revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our agreements with some of our clients require us to remain knowledgeable about and comply with a number of relevant consumer protection laws 
failure to perform our services in a manner that complies with any such requirement could result in breaches of contracts with our clients 
our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil fines and criminal penalties 

table of contents risks related to the international nature of our business our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry  or if the same are not available for other reasons 
under the income tax act  of india  we have benefited from a holiday from indian corporate income taxes 
as a result  our service operations have to date been subject to relatively lower tax liabilities 
we incurred minimal income tax expense in as a result of the tax holiday  compared to approximately million that we would have additionally incurred if the tax holiday had not been available for that period without accounting for double taxation treaty set offs 
our current tax holiday in respect of some of our operations centers expires in march consequently  our tax expense will materially increase and our after tax profitability will be materially reduced 
in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   with effect from april   that imposed a minimum alternative tax  or mat  on indian companies that have book profits but no tax profit which could be for various reasons  including tax holidays  tax deductions or significant depreciation 
any mat paid by us can be carried forward for a maximum period of ten years and can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiration of the tax holiday  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we currently benefit from a four year income tax holiday in the philippines that is extendable for an additional two years 
our current income tax holidays in the philippines are expected to expire in the middle of  unless extended 
while we intend to apply for extensions of these holidays  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or these holidays could be removed entirely due to changes in the government of the philippines 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 
we may be required to pay additional taxes in connection with audits by the indian taxing authorities 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among the company s subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements 
accordingly  the company determines the pricing among its associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
the tax authorities have jurisdiction to review this arrangement and in the event that they determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  the company may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties 
the company is currently involved in disputes with the indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies for past years aggregating to approximately million 
the company has already deposited million against the amounts demanded 
entity tax year issue amount demanded amount deposited exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc in the tax year was not appropriate and also disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india

table of contents based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we continue to believe that the probability of loss is remote and have not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements 
any amount paid by us as deposits will be refunded to us with interest if we succeed in our appeals with the appropriate tax authorities 
we cannot assure you that our appeals will be successful or that these appeals will be finally resolved in the near future 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for details 
introduction of tax legislation and disputes with tax authorities may have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall tax rate 
governments in countries in which we operate or provide services could enact new tax legislation which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our operations centers in a tax efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws  possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties 
changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate  or that other income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction  we may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties  which would cause our tax expense to increase  possibly materially  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows 
currency fluctuations among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although a substantial portion of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling in or us dollars in  most of our expenses in are incurred and paid in indian rupees 
we report our financial results in us dollars 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
the average indian rupee us dollar exchange rate in was approximately based on the bloomberg composite rate bcr  representing depreciation of the indian rupee of compared to the average exchange rate in the average indian rupee uk pound sterling exchange rate in was approximately based on the bcr  representing appreciation of the indian rupee of compared to the average exchange rate in the average us us pound sterling exchange rate in was approximately based on bcr representing appreciation of the us dollar of compared to the average exchange rate in the average philippine peso us dollar exchange rate in was approximately based on the bcr  representing depreciation of the philippine peso of compared to the average exchange rate in although we take steps to hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar foreign currency exposures  our results of operations may be adversely affected if the indian rupee fluctuates significantly against the uk pound sterling or the uk dollar  the uk pound sterling further depreciates against the uk dollar  our hedging strategy is unsuccessful or if the hedging markets have insufficient liquidity or depth to allow us to implement our hedging strategy in a cost effective manner 
any failure by our hedging counterparties to meet their contractual obligations there under could materially and adversely effect our profitability 
we are subject to legal restrictions on hedging activities as well as the convertibility of currencies in india 
this could limit our ability to use cash generated in one country in another country and could limit our ability to hedge our exposures 
finally  our hedging policies only provide near term protection from exchange rate fluctuations 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries could adversely affect the financial markets  result in a loss of client confidence and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  including those involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries  may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to 
table of contents economic recession  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles 
these events also pose significant risks to our people and to our operations centers 
south asia has  from time to time  experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including india  pakistan and china 
in recent years there have been several instances of military confrontations along the indo pakistan border 
there continues to be potential for hostilities between india and pakistan due to recent terrorist activities and the geopolitical climate along the border 
although this has not been the case to date  such political tensions could create a perception that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by india based companies  which could have a material adverse effect on the market for our services 
furthermore  if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons  we might not be able to continue to operate 
our insurance policies may not insure us against losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war 
we may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience 
we intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to maintain an appropriate cost structure and meet our clients delivery needs 
this may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate 
it may involve expanding into less developed countries  which may have less political  social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems 
as we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory  personnel  technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to start up our operations or become profitable in such countries 
this may affect our relationships with our clients and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india  and we are subject to regulatory  economic and political uncertainties in india 
our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in india  and a majority of our assets and our professionals are located in india 
we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india 
in the early s  india experienced significant inflation  low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign currency reserves 
the indian government  however  has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy 
india s government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy  including the bpo industry 
certain of those programs  which have benefited us  include tax holidays  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
we cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue 
various factors  such as changes in the current federal government  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
in addition  the government of india is considering introducing a reservation policy to the private sector in india  pursuant to which all private sector companies operating in india  including our subsidiaries  would be required to reserve a certain percentage of jobs for the economically underprivileged population in the states where such companies are incorporated 
if this policy is adopted  our ability to hire employees of our choice may be affected due to restrictions on our pool of potential employees and competition for these professionals 
the choice of india as an outsourcing destination and our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india  including changes in exchange rates and controls  interest rates and taxation policies  as well as social stability and political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
in particular  india has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years  but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years 
table of contents ahead 
these challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education 
our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  develop and operate our operations centers  and attract and retain clients could be adversely affected if india does not successfully meet these challenges 
the philippines periodically experiences political or economic instability  which could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and harm our business 
the philippines continues to experience low growth in its gross domestic product  significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of rental and other cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the united states 
these conditions could create political or economic instability that could harm businesses operating in the philippines 
in addition  the philippines has and may continue to experience political instability  including strikes  demonstrations  protests  marches  coups d tat  guerilla activity or other types of civil disorder 
these instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the philippines could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the philippines 
restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states  which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues 
the vast majority of our employees are indian nationals 
the ability of some of our executives and employees to work with and meet our us and european clients and our clients from other countries depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits 
in response to terrorist attacks  the global economic downturn and public sentiments about the high unemployment rates in their respective economies  us and european immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas 
immigration laws in those countries may also require us to meet certain levels of compensation and comply with other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas 
these restrictions have significantly lengthened the time requirements to obtain visas for our personnel  which has in the past resulted  and may continue to result  in delays in the ability of our personnel to meet with our clients 
in addition  immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces  economic conditions or other events  including terrorist attacks 
we cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for personnel who need to get to our clients sites  or if the duration of such visas is shortened or if such visas are delayed  we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide these services on a timely and cost effective basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
an outbreak of an infectious disease or any other serious public health concerns in asia or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the outbreak of an infectious disease in asia or elsewhere or any other serious public health concerns could have a negative impact on the economies  financial markets and business activities in the countries in which our end markets are located  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome  avian influenza  or bird flu  or hn across asia and europe have adversely affected a number of countries and companies 
although we have not been adversely impacted by these recent outbreaks  we can give no assurance that a future outbreak of an infectious disease among humans or animals or any other serious public health concerns will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we are vulnerable to natural disasters that could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our business  results of operation and financial condition 
india is susceptible to natural disasters  including typhoons  tsunamis  floods and earthquakes 
the philippines is additionally susceptible to volcanic eruptions 
substantially all of our operations centers and employees are located in india and the philippines 
if our operations centers are damaged by a typhoon  tsunami  flood  earthquake  volcanic eruption or other natural disaster  our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients could be interrupted or delayed significantly 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
in addition  although all of our operations centers have access to other power sources  disaster management facilities in india may not be adequate to protect against potential losses 
in addition  clients may terminate their contracts with us if we cannot resume providing services quickly enough 
as a result  a natural disaster in india or the philippines could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
if more stringent labor laws or other industry standards in india become applicable to us  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects the interests of workers  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
in addition  we are subject to certain industry standards regarding our employees  particularly with regard to overtime and transportation of employees 
our employees may also in the future form unions 
if these labor laws or industry standards become more stringent or are more strictly enforced  or if our employees unionize  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies  discharge employees or downsize  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the government of india has recently focused on the occupational health and safety concerns experienced by workers in the outsourcing industry 
the introduction of legislation imposing restrictions on working hours or conditions of professionals in the outsourcing industry could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the united states against our subsidiaries in india or our executive officers 
our primary operating subsidiaries are organized outside the united states and a number of our executive officers reside outside of the united states 
most of our assets are located in india 
as a result  you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in india outside their jurisdiction of residence 
in addition  you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in courts of the united states  including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the united states 
sections a and section of the indian civil procedure code   or the civil code  govern recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments 
section a of the civil code provides for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment without having to file an original suit in india  provided such judgments have been rendered by courts in a country or territory outside india which the government of india has declared to be a reciprocating territory 
we have been advised by our indian counsel that the united states and india do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments other than certain arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not it is predicated upon the federal securities laws of the united states  would not be enforceable in india as such 
however  if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in india based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the united states  section of the civil code provides that the foreign judgment will be conclusive as to certain matters 
the suit must be brought in india within three years of the date of the foreign judgment 
it is unlikely  however  that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a court in the united states if an action is brought in india 
it is also unlikely that an indian court would enforce judgments obtained in the united states if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice

see forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading provider of outsourcing and transformation services focused on providing a competitive edge to our clients by outsourcing and transforming their business processes 
our outsourcing services provide integrated front  middle and back office process outsourcing services for our principally us based and us based clients 
outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client  such as claims processing  finance and accounting and customer service  after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis 
we also offer a number of transformation services that include decision analytics  risk and financial management and operations and process excellence services 
these transformation services help our clients improve their operating environments through cost reduction  enhanced efficiency and productivity initiatives  and improve the risk and control environments within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
a significant portion of our business relates to processes that we believe are integral to our clients operations  and the close nature of our relationships with our clients assists us in developing strong strategic long term relationships with them 
we serve primarily the needs of global companies in the insurance  utilities  banking and financial services and transportation and logistics sectors 
we market our services directly through our sales and marketing and strategic account management teams  which operate out of the united states and the united kingdom  and our business development team  which operates out of noida  india 
we currently operate ten operations centers in india  one operations center in the philippines and one operations center in the czech republic 
we are also in the process of establishing new operations centers in cluj  romania and noida and jaipur  india 
on july   we acquired a stake in schneider sro which is located in the czech republic and which provides complex transaction processing services to its clients in europe and the us the acquisition provided us with multi lingual delivery capabilities and a cost effective delivery location in eastern europe 
on november   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with american express pursuant to which we acquired the operations of the american express global travel service center  a business unit of american express located in gurgaon  india  that provides the travel related business process outsourcing services of american express 
american express is an existing client of the company 
the purchase price of the transaction is approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the transaction closed on march  on august   the company completed the sale of all of its shares of noida customer operations private limited ncop to aviva global services singapore pte ltd 
for all the periods presented  ncop is reported as a discontinued operation and any discussion throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
revenues we generate revenues principally from contracts to provide outsourcing and transformation services 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million compared to total revenues of million in  an increase of million or 
revenues from outsourcing services were higher by million in when compared to  primarily due to volume increases within existing clients of approximately million  receipt of a contract termination fee of million  revenues of million from new clients  including the acquisition of schneider sro  which increases were partially offset by a million 
table of contents reduction due to the appreciation of the us dollar against the us pound sterling 
revenues from transformation services were lower by million in when compared to  primarily due to lower client discretionary spending arising out of the continuing broad based weakness in the economy and the effect of appreciation of the us dollar against the uk pound sterling 
we anticipate that our revenues will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base  both organically and through acquisitions 
we provide our clients with a range of outsourcing services  including insurance services  banking and financial services  utilities support services  finance and accounting services  and collection services 
our clients transfer the management and execution of their processes or business functions to us 
as part of this transfer  we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant outsourcing services  implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers 
each client contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement 
the outsourcing services we provide to any of our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income that we derive from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
for outsourcing services  we enter into long term agreements with our clients with initial terms ranging from three to five years 
although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our outsourcing services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase 
our transformation services include various services such as decision analytics services  which are intended to facilitate more effective data based strategic and operating decisions by our clients  risk and financial management services and operations and process excellence services 
our transformation services can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
in addition  our transformation services consist primarily of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to further material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
we serve clients mainly in the united states and the united kingdom  with these two regions generating approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  in both the united states and the united kingdom  there has been recent negative publicity and proposed legislation with regard to outsourcing

risk factors risks related to our business our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the united states and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
if these trends continue and result in the enactment of additional legislation for which we are unable to contractually protect ourselves  our revenues could be materially affected 
with the recent global economic downturn and resulting increases in unemployment in both of these countries  we expect these publicity and legislative trends to continue and possibly intensify 
our management actively monitors legislative activities in the united states and united kingdom  both directly and through industry organizations 
however  if legislation were enacted in the united states or the united kingdom that has the effect of severely curtailing our activities in such countries  it is unlikely that we would be able to quickly replace such lost revenues 

table of contents we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in the years ended december  and  our total revenues from our two largest clients were million and million  respectively  accounting for and of our total revenues  respectively  during these periods 
we provide services to centrica  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under an agreement that is scheduled to expire in april centrica may terminate the agreement without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee 
we provide services to travelers  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under a services agreement 
travelers may terminate the services agreement  or any work assignment or work order thereunder  each of which expires in december  without cause upon days prior notice 
we derived revenues from nineteen and twenty three new clients for our services  including our transformation services  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base  we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients 
revenues also include amounts representing reimbursable expenses that are billed to and reimbursed by our clients and typically include telecommunication and travel related costs 
the amount of reimbursable expenses that we incur  and any resulting revenues  can vary significantly from period to period depending on each client s situation and on the type of services provided 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our revenues represent reimbursement of such expenses 
to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary  we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts 
we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar and rupee us pound rupee us dollar foreign currency exposure 
our management has observed in recent periods a shift in industry pricing models toward transaction based pricing and other pricing models 
we believe this trend will continue and we have begun to use transaction based pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transaction based pricing model 
transaction based pricing places the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain our operating margins 
in addition  we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs 
we believe that the trend toward multi vendor relationships will continue 
a multi vendor relationship allows a client to seek more client friendly pricing and other contract terms from each vendor  which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor 
to the extent our large clients expand their use of multi vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors  our operating margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients to the extent we are required to modify the terms of our relationship with such clients 
expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of employee costs  which include salary  retention and other compensation expenses  recruitment and training costs  non cash amortization of stock compensation expense  and traveling and lodging costs  and 
table of contents costs relating to our facilities and communications network  which include telecommunication and it costs  facilities and customer management support  operational expenses for our outsourcing centers  and rent expenses 
the most significant components of our cost of revenues is employee compensation  recruitment  training and retention 
salary levels in india  employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues 
salary increases are generally awarded each year effective april accordingly  employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year 
we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements 
although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated  a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees in india  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute outsourcing services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes a non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients 
we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in india  the philippines and the united states to service additional business and as wages continue to increase in india 
in particular  we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
as our existing competitors continue to grow  and as new competitors enter the market  we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase  with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals 
we also expect our cost of revenues to increase due to employee turnover resulting in higher recruitment and training costs 
see item a risk factors employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our outsourcing services  which require significant commitments of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
in addition  once a client engages us in a new contract  our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract  generally three to four months  is completed 
we also expect cost of revenues to increase when we add new operations centers due to increases in telecommunication  rent expenses and other facilities operating costs 
as we increase the amount of physical infrastructure available to perform our operations  we expect that utilization will decrease and this will have a negative impact on our operating margin 
sg a expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel  legal and other professional fees  telecommunications  utilities and other miscellaneous administrative costs 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries of sales and marketing and strategic account management personnel  client relationship management  travel and brand building 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our front end sales and strategic account management functions to better serve our clients 
we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our back end support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development  
table of contents performance management and training programs 
sg a expenses also include non cash amortization of stock compensation expense related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management  members of our board of directors and advisory board  other support personnel and consultants 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation and amortization of our tangible assets  including network equipment  cabling  computers  office furniture and equipment  motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired is part of depreciation and amortization 
as we add facilities  including our three new operations center in cluj romania  noida  india and jaipur  india  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers  servers and other infrastructure 
foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars and a substantial portion of our total revenues is earned in uk pounds sterling 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected if the uk pound sterling depreciates against the uk dollar 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars or uk pounds sterling and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december   most of our expenses were incurred and paid in indian rupees and the philippine peso and  respectively  in the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively  in the year ended december  
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate in the future 
the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee appreciates or depreciates against the us dollar or the us pound sterling 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india  an exporter of outsourcing services that is registered with a software technology park or an export processing zone in india  such as our indian subsidiaries in india  is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of months from the date of exports 
similarly  in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers  it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of months 
if those subsidiaries in india did not meet these conditions  they would be required to obtain permission to export foreign currency from the reserve bank of india 
income taxes the fiscal year under the indian income tax act ends on march certain facilities leased by the company s indian subsidiaries qualify for an exemption from corporate tax under section a or b of the indian income tax act 
this exemption is available for a period of ten consecutive years beginning with the financial year in which the facility begins to manufacture or produce eligible goods and services 
during the year ended december   the indian government effected further amendments to the indian income tax act and extended the tax holiday for eligible units to march  after the expiration of the tax holiday period for some of the facilities leased by the company s indian subsidiaries on april   any profits generated from the services provided from such facilities will be fully taxable 
as a result of the expiration of the tax holiday period during  our tax expense will materially increase in and after we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 

table of contents in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   that imposed mat on indian companies that benefit from a tax holiday with effect from april  any mat paid by us can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiry of the tax holiday for up to ten years  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in accordance with asc no

the income tax holiday is subject to validation by the philippines economic zone authority based on certain minimum investments 
if exl philippines does not attain the required investments it will not qualify for the income tax holiday and will be subject to a gross income tax 
the company is currently in the process of establishing new operations centers in noida and jaipur  india 
these new operations centers are located within special economic zones and will benefit from tax holidays for services provided from such locations 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among the company s subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements 
accordingly  the company determines the pricing among its associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
the tax authorities have jurisdiction to review this arrangement and in the event that they determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  the company may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties 
the company is currently involved in disputes with the indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies for past years aggregating to approximately million

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating tax liabilities  stock based compensation  goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  derivative instruments and pension plan liabilities 
these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below 
future events may not develop exactly as forecast  and estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from outsourcing and transformation services 
revenues from outsourcing services are recognized primarily on a time and material  cost plus or unit priced basis  revenues from transformation services are recognized primarily on a time and material  fixed price or contingent fee basis 
the services provided within our contracts generally contain one unit of accounting 
revenue is recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized on time and material contracts primarily on the basis of full time equivalent employees  including direct and indirect costs  incurred on a client contract 
revenue is recognized on cost plus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit mark up 
revenue is recognized on unit price based contracts based on the number of specified units of work such as the number of e mail responses delivered to a client 
such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract 
when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy  we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred 
revenue is recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client 
we have experienced minimal service credits and penalties to date 
revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to date to the estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined 
if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project  such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified 
revenue on contingent fee based contracts is recognized when the related contingency has been met to the client s satisfaction 
the company accrues for revenue and receivables for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date 
accordingly  our accounts receivable include amounts for services that we have performed and for which an invoice has not yet been issued to the client 
these are included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and the amounts are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc no 
 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
the guidance specifies criteria as 
table of contents to intangible assets acquired in a business combination that must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc no 
 all assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses including goodwill are assigned to reporting units 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
when determining the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  risk free rates  market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc no 
 cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting periods 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment  including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their share based options  we have used data on the historical exercise pattern of employees 
we use the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatility of stocks of our comparative companies in order to estimate future share price trends 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if the actual forfeiture rate differs significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business  we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our primary exchange rate exposure is to uk pound sterling and the indian rupee 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and not for speculative trading purposes 

table of contents we hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated effective and that qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc no 

changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective  are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax aoci until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we also use derivatives consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments under asc no 
to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
derivative assets and liabilities included in level primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts 
the quotes are taken primarily from highly rated financial institutions 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis 
if during this time  a contract is deemed ineffective  the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of income and is included in foreign exchange gain loss 
for hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period  any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax estimates include decisions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation of our tax position  we believe we have adequately accrued for probable exposures as of december  to the extent we are able to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
at december   we performed an analysis of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for certain units of our indian subsidiaries  currently under the tax holiday period  and concluded that a valuation allowance offsetting those deferred tax assets be recorded  on the basis that it is more likely than not that there will not be future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
we perform this assessment at the end of each reporting period 
please see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
retirement benefits we provide our employees in india and the philippines with benefits under a defined benefit plan  which we refer to as the gratuity plan 
the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee s salary and years of employment with us 
we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the 
table of contents projected unit credit method 
under this method  we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement  death  resignation or other termination of services 
critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate  expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  our gratuity expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations year ended december  in million total revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization gross profit operating expenses general and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses depreciation and amortization expenses total operating expenses income from continuing operations other income expense foreign exchange gain loss interest and other income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income revenues include reimbursable expenses of million in  million in and million in revenues also include contract termination fees of million in and million in cost of revenues includes million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively  as non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients as described in note to our consolidated financial statements

cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  generally  factors that affect our earnings including pricing  volume of services  costs and productivity affect our cash flows provided by or used for operations in a similar manner 
however  while management of working capital  including timing of collections and payments  affects operating results only indirectly  the impact on working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  is predominantly due to changes in working capital by million  partially offset by the 
table of contents decrease in net income adjusted for non cash items by million 
trade accounts receivable increased slightly from million at december  to million at december  however  our days sales outstanding  including unbilled receivables decreased from approximately days as of december  to days as of december  increase in cash flow from working capital changes is primarily due to changes in deferred revenue  other assets  income tax payable and accounts payable resulting in net cash inflow aggregating to million  offset by the changes in restricted cash and accounts receivable resulting in net cash outflow of million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  cash flows used for investing activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to net investments in time deposits of million and net payout for business acquisitions of million during the year ended december  reflecting our purchase of schneider sro for approximately million as compared to the year ended december  during which period we completed acquisitions for approximately million  partially offset by lower capital expenditures of million and net proceeds of million from sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities were insignificant during the years ended december  and we expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business 
as we have focused on expanding our cash flow from operating activities  we continue to make capital investments  primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build out our facilities and purchase of telecommunications and networking equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations 
we incurred approximately million of capital expenditures in the year ended december  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million in the calendar year primarily to meet the growth requirements of our clients  including additions to our existing facilities and establishing new operations centers in cluj  romania  noida  india and jaipur  india as well as to improve our internal technology 
the timing and volume of such capital expenditures in the future will be affected by new contracts we may enter into or the expansion of our existing contracts 
through december   we had repurchased an aggregate of approximately million under our previously announced program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
in addition  in connection with the tax assessment orders issued against exl india and exl inc we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by us and for similar orders for subsequent years that may be received by us 
as required by the mutual agreement procedure map  we obtained bank guarantees of approximately million in april to stop the collection of the outstanding tax demands by the indian tax authorities and interest for the assessment orders received by exl inc for the  and tax years 
subsequent to december   the company has also obtained a bank guarantee of approximately million with respect to the assessment orders received by exl india for the tax year 
if additional assessment orders are received for subsequent years  we may invoke the map for such orders and would be required to obtain additional bank guarantees 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
based on economic conditions as of december   we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing capital expenditure  working capital and other cash needs in the near term 
if we have significant growth through acquisitions  we may need to obtain additional financing 
on july   we acquired a stake in schneider sro  which is located in olomouc  the czech republic  for cash consideration of approximately million net of cash acquired of million  which was funded through our internal cash accruals 
on november   we entered into an agreement with american express to acquire the operations of the american express global travel service center  a business unit of american express located in gurgaon  india  which acquisition was completed on march  for a purchase consideration of approximately million funded through our internal cash accruals 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period in millions less than year years years after years total capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other obligations a total contractual cash obligations a represents estimated payments under the company s gratuity plan 
certain units of our indian subsidiaries have been established as export oriented units under the export import policy the policy or software technology parks of india units stpi under the stpi guidelines issued by the government of india that has provided us with certain incentives on imported and indigenous capital goods 
under the policy  these units must achieve certain export ratios and realize revenues attributable to exports over a specified period 
in the event that these units are unable to meet the requirements over the specified period  we may be required to refund these incentives along with penalties and fines 
however  we believe that these units will achieve the export levels within the required timeframe as they have consistently generated the required levels of export revenues 
exl philippines is registered as an ecozone it enterprise with the philippines economic zone authority 
exl philippines has an export obligation of million during the three year period ending march the registration has also provided us with certain incentives on the import of capital goods 
we believe that exl philippines will achieve these export levels within the required timeframe

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes first  it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and second  it eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition

it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss 
we manage market risk through our treasury operations 
our senior management and our board of directors 
table of contents approve our treasury operation s objectives and policies 
the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures  borrowing strategies  if any  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies 
components of market risk foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars in the year ended december  or uk pounds sterling in the year ended december   substantial portion of our expenses were incurred and paid in indian rupees and philippine pesos 
and  respectively in the year ended december  
we also incur expenses in us dollars  the czech koruna and the currencies of the other countries in which we have operations 
the exchange rates primarily among the indian rupee  uk pound sterling and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues  expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable and payable 
based upon our level of operations during the year ended december  and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period  a appreciation depreciation in the uk pound sterling against the uk dollar would have increased decreased revenues in the year ended december  by approximately million 
similarly  a appreciation depreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increased decreased our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees in the year ended december  by approximately million 
we have sought to reduce the effect of indian rupee  uk pound sterling and certain other local currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts to cover a substantial portion of our expected cash flows 
forward exchange contracts with a notional amount of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  and of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  the forward foreign exchange contracts typically mature within one to thirty six months  must be settled on the day of maturity or may be cancelled subject to the payment of any gains or losses in the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation 
we use these instruments as cash flow hedges and not for speculative purposes 
we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and uk pound sterling foreign exchange currency risks 
in addition  any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism 
we may  in the future  adopt more active hedging policies  and have done so in the past 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as foreign exchange gain loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  these amounts were invested principally in a short term investment portfolio primarily comprised of highly rated mutual funds  money market accounts and time deposits 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a decrease in short term rates would reduce our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million 

table of contents credit risk 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable from our largest client account for of our total outstanding receivable as of december  we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations
