item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading us steel service center with over years of experience 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we act as an intermediary between steel producers and manufacturers that require processed steel for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and steel service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
we operate as a single business segment with strategically located processing and distribution facilities in connecticut  georgia  illinois  iowa  michigan  minnesota  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina and washington 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
we sell a broad range of steel products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the availability of steel  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by our michigan and georgia operations 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
all international sales and payments are made in us dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to  general and global business  economic  financial  banking and political conditions  competition  steel pricing  demand and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of steel  inventory held in the supply chain  customer demand for steel  customers ability to manage their credit line availability  and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the steel industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers  competitors and end use customers 
like many other steel service centers  we maintain substantial inventories of steel to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase steel in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts  historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase steel are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
we have no long term  fixed price steel purchase contracts 
when steel prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when steel prices decline  as they did in the fourth quarter of and through the first half of  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower margins as we use existing steel inventory 
as selling prices declined in  our average selling prices fell below our average cost of inventory requiring us to recognize inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
we were required under generally accepted accounting principles to write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value  less reasonable costs to 
table of contents complete the inventory into finished form  resulting in a million pre tax charge at the end of the first quarter of selling prices continued to decline during the second quarter of  resulting in an additional million inventory lower of cost or market pre tax charge effective as of june  due to the ongoing global economic crisis and the unprecedented drop in sales  we took significant steps to reduce our operating expenses 
we have reduced our annual operating expenses for by million  or  compared to our total annual operating expenses 
the cost reductions were achieved through various initiatives  including headcount reductions of from peak levels  elimination of temporary labor and overtime  reduced work hours to match depressed customer production schedules  company wide base pay reductions ranging from to  including cash compensation reductions taken by our executive management team equal to of each executives base salary  a cash compensation reduction of our board of directors fees  the consolidation of our philadelphia facility into our other facilities  benefits reductions  and heightened control over all discretionary spending 
at december   we employed approximate people  however due to the ongoing global economic crisis  some of those employees were temporarily laid off and many of our hourly employees worked less than hours per week during approximately of our hourly plant personnel at our minneapolis and detroit facilities are represented by three separate collective bargaining units 
in september  a collective bargaining agreement covering our detroit workers was extended through august  in march  a collective bargaining agreement covering our minneapolis plate facility workers was extended to march  a collective bargaining agreement covering our minneapolis coil facility workers expires on september  we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of an historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
revenue recognition for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred  which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended december   and dollars shown in thousands of net of net of net sales sales sales net sales gross profit a operating expenses b operating income loss a gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold and includes million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments in b operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold 
compared to tons sold decreased to thousand in from million in tons sold in included thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in tons sold in were significantly lower to all markets we sell  compared to  due to recessionary pressures and unprecedented crises in global financial markets 
many of our large original equipment manufacturers had numerous plant closings and significant reductions in their production schedules during we expect our tons sold in to gradually increase over levels as the economy slowly recovers 
net sales decreased to million in from billion in the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and a decline in average selling prices due to recessionary pressures  the ongoing global economic crisis  the liquidation of inventory at steel service centers and less value added sales 

table of contents average selling prices declined in to per ton  compared with  per ton in during the late fourth quarter of  steel producers began increasing the price of steel and have implemented additional price increases for the first quarter of  which we believe will result in our first quarter average selling prices being higher than levels experienced during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net sales  gross profit  including the inventory lower of cost or market adjustment  decreased to in from in the the price of steel purchased from steel producers began to rapidly decrease in late third quarter of at the same time  customer demand began to decrease significantly due to the ongoing global economic crisis  which resulted in lower overall selling prices 
this condition continued during the fourth quarter of and first half of our average cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  increased during these periods as we sold steel we acquired on earlier dates at higher prices 
the higher cost of goods sold  combined with lower selling prices  resulted in decreased gross margins 
as selling prices further declined in the first half of  our average selling prices fell below our average cost of inventory  resulting in inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
we were required to write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value average selling price less reasonable costs to complete the inventory into finished form  resulting in a million pre tax charge at the end of the first quarter of selling prices continued to decline during the second quarter of  resulting in an additional million inventory lower of cost or market pre tax adjustment at june  inventory lower of cost or market adjustments reduced the carrying value of the inventory on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding expense was recorded through the cost of materials sold on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
steel producers began to increase the price of steel in the late fourth quarter of and have implemented additional price increases for the first quarter of we believe that our first quarter gross profit will be higher than levels experienced during the fourth quarter of as we sell steel inventories that were acquired prior to the steel producers price increases 
due to the ongoing global economic crisis and the unprecedented drop in sales  we took significant steps to reduce our operating expenses 
operating expenses in decreased million or from lower operating expenses in were primarily attributable to decreased levels of variable incentive compensation associated with lower levels of profitability the majority of which was recorded in general and administrative operating expense captions  with a portion also recorded in the warehouse and processing and selling expense captions  decreased distribution expense resulting from reduced shipping levels recorded in the distribution expense caption and decreased warehouse and processing expense associated with lower shipping levels 
additional cost reductions were achieved through various initiatives  including headcount reductions of from peak levels  elimination of temporary labor and overtime  reduced work hours to match depressed customer production schedules  company wide base pay reductions ranging from to  including cash compensation reductions taken by our executive management team equal to of each executive s base salary  a cash compensation reduction of our board of directors fees  the consolidation of our philadelphia operations into our other facilities  benefits reductions and heightened control over all discretionary spending 
we expect the economy to slowly improve in and we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase commensurately with increased sales volumes 
due to the capitalization of our new operating system and the completion of several facility expansions  we estimate that our depreciation expense will be approximately million higher than experienced during interest and other expense on debt totaled million in compared to million in our effective borrowing rate  exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees  was in compared to in the increase in interest and other expense on debt was primarily attributable to higher overall borrowing levels during the first nine months of the year  higher amortization of financing fees related the amendments of our credit facility and lower amounts of interest capitalized into long term projects 
during  we incurred a total of million of interest and other expense on debt  of which million was recorded as expense on the consolidated statement of operations and million which was capitalized into long term projects 
in april and july  as a result of deteriorating market conditions and our inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  we obtained amendments to modify certain financial covenants contained in our credit facility 
interest and other expense on debt includes fees associated with the amendments of our credit facility  which are being 
table of contents amortized through june as part of the amendments  our average cost of borrowings has increased to approximately to 
we entered debt free and we expect our first quarter borrowing levels to be low 
for  loss before income taxes totaled million compared to net income before taxes of million in an income tax benefit of was recorded for  compared to a tax provision of for the majority of the losses can be carried back to prior years  resulting in approximately million of future income tax refunds to be received in income taxes refunded  net of income taxes paid  during totaled million  compared to million of income taxes paid during net loss for totaled million or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for compared to tons sold in decreased to million tons from million tons in tons sold in included million tons from direct sales and thousand tons from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in recessionary pressures and unprecedented crises in global financial markets during the second half of led to a decrease in tons sold 
net sales in increased to billion from billion 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices 
average selling prices for increased from average selling prices began to decrease during the fourth quarter of due to reduced customer demand and the sharp reduction in the price of steel offered by steel producers 
in  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to from in higher selling prices were primarily the result of higher steel prices from steel producers that were passed through to our customers 
during the first three quarters of  carbon steel prices approximately doubled  resulting in higher cost of materials sold 
for most of  the increase in average selling prices exceeded the increase in average cost of materials sold  resulting in higher gross profit  as we sold inventory which was acquired earlier in the year at lower prices 
the price of steel purchased from steel producers began to decrease in the late third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  our average selling prices decreased while our average cost of materials sold increased  as we sold inventory which was acquired during the third quarter of at higher prices 
as a result  our average gross profit began to fall during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for decreased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in higher operating expenses in were primarily attributable to increased levels of variable incentive compensation associated with higher levels of profitability the majority of which was recorded in the general and administrative operating expense caption  with a portion also recorded in the warehouse and processing caption  increased sales commissions and bad debt expense recorded in the selling expense caption  increased distribution expense resulting from higher fuel costs recorded in the distribution expense caption and increased warehouse and processing expense associated with higher levels of value added services provided to our customers 
most of the higher operating expenses recorded in are variable and are tied to higher levels of profitability 
as profitability declined in the fourth quarter of  many of these expenses have decreased accordingly 
additionally  starting in the second half of  we eliminated our temporary labor  restricted overtime and introduced reduced work weeks  resulting in the reduction of approximately full time equivalent employees or of our workforce 
interest and other expense on debt decreased to million from million in the decrease in interest expense in was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and borrowing rates  and the capitalization of interest into certain long term capital projects 
during  we incurred a total of million of interest and other expense on debt  of which million was recorded as expense on the consolidated statement of operations and million which was capitalized into long term projects 
our effective borrowing rate  exclusive of deferred financing fees  was in  compared to in 
table of contents in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing  upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities and other businesses  making acquisitions and paying dividends 
we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements 
we believe that funds available under our credit facility  lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities  together with funds generated from operations and expected tax refunds  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  our dividend payments and any business acquisitions over at least the next months 
in the future  we may as part of our business strategy  acquire and dispose of other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures 
accordingly  the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
compared to working capital at december  totaled million  a million decrease from december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in accounts receivable resulting from lower sales volumes and sales prices and a million reduction in inventories inclusive of million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  partially offset by a million increase in income taxes receivable and deferred  a million reduction in accounts payable associated with lower steel prices and reduced steel purchases and a million reduction in accrued expenses primarily associated with lower incentives and compensation 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was used to fund losses and million was generated from working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
the expenditures were primarily attributable to the completion of projects that were started during the second half of  including the expansion of our chambersburg  pennsylvania facility  the completion of a new office building in winder  georgia  site work related to a suspended project in south carolina and continued investments in our new business system 
in  depending on economic conditions  we expect to spend approximately to million for capital expenditures 
we continue to successfully implement our new business systems  including system enhancements to assist with our growing fabrication work 
during  we expensed million and capitalized million associated with the implementation of the new information system 
since the project began in  we have expensed million and capitalized million associated with the new information system 
in march  we began depreciating the portion of the new information system that was placed in service at that time 
in  we used million for financing activities  which primarily consisted of million of repayments under our revolving credit facility and a million decrease in outstanding checks 
in february  our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of per share  which is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  our board previously approved regular quarterly dividends of   and per share  which were paid on march   june   september  and december   respectively 
regular dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash  the million annual limitation on cash dividends under our revolving credit facility  and continuing determination by our board of directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders 

table of contents our secured bank financing agreement is a revolving credit facility collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories and substantially all of our property and equipment 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base  comprised of eligible receivables and inventories  or million in the aggregate 
the credit facility matures on december  the credit facility  which was last amended in july  requires us to comply with various covenants  the most significant of which include i a million reserve on availability  replaced with a minimum availability requirement of million  tested monthly  commencing with the month ending june   ii a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of  tested monthly  commencing with the month ended june   iii a maximum leverage ratio of  tested quarterly  iv commencing with the month ending april   consolidated ebitda of no less than  for the three month period ending with each subsequent month thereafter until and including may   commencing with the month ending april  through and including the month ending may   a cumulative consolidated ebitda for such period of no less than  v limitations on dividends  capital expenditures and investments  and vi restrictions on additional indebtedness 
all ebitda covenants exclude up to million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
as of december   we were in compliance with our covenants  had no outstanding borrowings and had approximately million of availability under the credit facility 
we expect to borrow money during the first quarter of to fund increased working capital needs associated with higher inventory prices and stronger sales 
compared to working capital at december  increased million from the end of the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in inventories and an million decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the fluctuation in inventories was primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory held at year end due to weaker than expected fourth quarter sales at higher  overall prices 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was derived from cash earnings and million was used for working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
in september  we began the process of expanding our chambersburg  pennsylvania facility by  square feet at a total cost of approximately million

other than operating leases  as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk during the past several years  the base price of carbon flat rolled steel has fluctuated significantly and rapidly 
we witnessed unprecedented steel producer price increases during the first nine months of followed by rapid and steep steel price declines during the fourth quarter of and first half of rapidly declining prices  as we experienced during the first six months of  reduced our gross profit margin percentages to levels that were lower than our historical levels  and resulted in inventory lower of cost or market adjustments 
higher inventory levels held by us  other steel service centers or end use customers could cause competitive pressures that could also reduce gross profit 
lower raw material costs for steel producers could result in customer demands for lower cost product result in lower selling prices 
higher raw material costs for steel producers could cause the price of steel to increase 
rising prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our customers 
some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of steel 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future 
declining steel prices  as we have experienced in the fourth quarter of and first half of  have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income  while increasing steel prices  as experienced during the third quarter of  have favorably affected our net sales and net income 
approximately of our net sales in were directly to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts 
the automotive industry experiences significant fluctuations in demand based on numerous factors such as general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
the automotive industry is also subject  from time to time  to labor work stoppages 
the domestic automotive industry  which has experienced a number of bankruptcies  is currently involved in significant restructuring  which has resulted in lower production volumes 
certain customers in this industry represent an increasing credit risk 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
we have not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from borrowings under our credit facility at variable rates 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under our credit facility
