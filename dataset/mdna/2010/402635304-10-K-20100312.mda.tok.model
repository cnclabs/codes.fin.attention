item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations  estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with our principal producing properties located along the louisiana gulf coast in the west cote blanche bay  or wcbb  and hackberry fields  and in west texas in the permian basin 
we also hold a significant acreage position in the alberta oil sands in canada through our interest in grizzly oil sands ulc  and have interests in entities that operate in southeast asia  including the phu horm gas field in thailand 
we seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs 
developments oil and natural gas revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for net income increased to million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december  production decreased to  boe for the year ended december  from  boe for during  we drilled wells and recompleted wells 
of our new wells drilled  were completed as producing wells  one was non productive and four are waiting on completion 
we sold approximately  net acres in the bakken for million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates including those related to oil and natural gas properties  revenue recognition  income taxes and commitments and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements oil and natural gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  all costs  including non productive costs and certain general and administrative costs directly associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  are capitalized 
net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net revenues  after income taxes  discounted at per year  from proven oil and natural gas reserves and the cost of the properties not subject to amortization 
such capitalized costs  including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs

index to financial statements if any  are depleted by an equivalent units of production method  converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposal of oil and natural gas properties  unless such dispositions significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proven oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas properties not subject to amortization consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds and totaled million at december  and million at december  these costs are reviewed periodically by management for impairment  with the impairment provision included in the cost of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization 
factors considered by management in its impairment assessment include our drilling results and those of other operators  the terms of oil and natural gas leases not held by production and available funds for exploration and development 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period january december  and prior to  unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value  including related deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion expense would be reduced 
a decline in oil and gas prices may result in an impairment of oil and gas properties 
for instance  as a result of the drop in commodity prices on december  and subsequent reduction in our proved reserves  we recognized a ceiling test impairment of  for the year ended december  if prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to decrease  we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and gas properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
no ceiling test impairment was required for the year ended december  asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
we account for abandonment and restoration liabilities under fasb asc which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability is recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed into service 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon settlement of the liability or the sale of the well  the liability is reversed 
these liability amounts may change because of changes in asset lives  estimated costs of abandonment or legal or statutory remediation requirements 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement  annual inflations of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted cost to settle such obligations discounted using our credit adjustment risk free interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates

index to financial statements oil and gas reserve quantities 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
netherland  sewell associates  inc  pinnacle energy services  llc and to a lesser extent our personnel have prepared reserve reports of our reserve estimates on a well by well basis for our properties 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income during the period the rate change is enacted 
deferred tax assets are recognized in the year in which realization becomes determinable 
periodically  management performs a forecast of its taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed  looking at both positive and negative factors 
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established  if in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized 
at december   a valuation allowance of million had been provided for deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty of future taxable income 
revenue recognition 
we derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced from our oil and gas properties 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment on substantially all of these sales from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers that month and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment received for all prior months are recorded at the end of the quarter after payment is received 
historically  our actual payments have not significantly deviated from our accruals 
commitments and contingencies 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we are involved in certain litigation for which the outcome is uncertain 
changes in the certainty and the ability to reasonably estimate a loss amount  if any  may result in the recognition and subsequent payment of legal liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in oil prices by utilizing energy swaps and collars  or fixed price contracts 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  as amended 
it requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of all derivative instruments 
table of contents 
index to financial statements using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  correlation between index prices and our realized prices  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
designation is established at the inception of a derivative  but re designation is permitted 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of fasb asc  changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we recognize any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness immediately in earnings 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  during  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production at a weighted average price of per barrel before transportation costs 
we delivered approximately of our production under these agreements 
initially  for the period january through december  we had entered into agreements to sell  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel before transportation costs 
in december  we terminated these forward sales contracts in exchange for million in cash 
subsequently  we entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs  for the period april to august we also entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs  for the period september to december in  we terminated forward sales contracts for the months of march and may for an aggregate of approximately million 
for the period january through february we entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs 
for the period march through december  we have entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs 
under these contracts  we have committed to deliver approximately of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
in addition  these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil 
these forward sales contacts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  and related pronouncements

depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased to  for  and consisted of  in depletion on oil and natural gas properties and  in depreciation of other property and equipment 
this compares to total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of  for this decrease was due primarily to the reduction in the book value of our oil and gas properties used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this reduction resulted from the drop in commodity prices reflected as of december  and the resulting reduction in our proved reserves which caused us to recognize a ceiling test impairment to our full cost pool of  for the year ended december  impairment of oil and gas properties

liquidity and capital resources overview 
historically  our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from our producing oil and natural gas properties  the issuance of equity securities and borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities

capital expenditures 
our recent capital commitments have been primarily for the development of our proved reserves  to increase our net acreage position in grizzly and fund grizzly s delineation drilling program and for acquisitions  primarily our acquisitions in the permian basin 
our strategy  subject to economic and industry conditions  is to continue to increase cash flow generated from our operations by undertaking new drilling  workover  sidetrack and recompletion projects to exploit our existing properties  subject to economic and industry conditions  and explore acquisition and disposition opportunities 
we have upgraded our infrastructure and our existing facilities in southern louisiana with the goal of increasing operating efficiencies and volume capacities and lowering lease operating expenses 
these upgrades were also intended to better enable our facilities to withstand future hurricanes with less damage 
additionally  we completed the reprocessing of d seismic data in one of our principal properties  wcbb 
the reprocessed data enables our geophysicists to continue to generate new prospects and enhance existing prospects in the intermediate zones in the field  thus creating a portfolio of new drilling opportunities 
in addition  with our acquisition of strategic assets in the permian basin in west texas  we are required to pay of all drilling costs for drilling activity on such properties 
to combat significant declines in the commodity prices during the second half of  management undertook a series of actions aimed at reducing capital spending and operating costs 
as a result  we reduced our drilling and other capital activities to a minimum in the fourth quarter of  releasing all rigs in southern louisiana and the permian and only selectively participating in wells in the bakken 
during  we were not bound by lease obligations and long term capital commitments relating to the exploration or development of our oil and gas properties 
as a result of the then current economic conditions  we initially reduced our estimated capital activities and aggressively sought price concessions from our service providers until such time costs were reduced to more appropriate levels 
currently  our afe costs have been reduced by to since as a result of the improvements in commodity prices and reductions in costs  we currently intend to expand our drilling activities 
in our december  reserve reports  of our net reserves were categorized as proved undeveloped 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved developed reserves  or both 
to realize reserves and increase production  we must continue our exploratory drilling  undertake other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish those activities 
our inventory of prospects includes approximately proved undeveloped drilling locations at wcbb 
the drilling schedule used in our december  reserve report anticipates that all of those wells will be drilled by from january  through march   we recompleted eight existing wells at our wcbb field 
we currently intend to spend a total of approximately to million to drill wells and recomplete wells in our wcbb field during in our east hackberry field  we intend to drill three land wells during total capital expenditures for our east hackberry field during are estimated at to million 
from january  through march   two gross wells were drilled in our permian acreage 
we currently anticipate that our capital requirements for our properties in the permian basin in west texas will be approximately to million during we have identified gross proved undeveloped net future development drilling locations 
we currently expect that approximately to net wells will be drilled on this acreage in

index to financial statements during the third quarter of  we purchased a interest in grizzly 
as of december   our net investment in grizzly was approximately million  including a note receivable of million 
capital requirements in for this project are estimated to be approximately million  primarily for the expenses associated with initial preparations of the algar lake facility 
capital expenditures in relating to our interest in thailand are expected to be approximately  which we believe will be mostly offset from our share of production from the phu horm field 
due to our sale transactions in  we expect no capital expenditures in relating to our interest in the bakken shale in the williston basin 
our total capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be to million 
this is an increase from the million spent in as we intend to expand our activities as a result of the improved commodity pricing and reduced cost environment 
in addition  through our cost reduction initiative  afe costs have been reduced by to from the costs quoted in we intend to monitor pricing and cost developments during and make adjustments to our capital expenditure program as warranted 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under our credit facility  if any  will be sufficient to meet our normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  and our wcbb  hackberry  permian basin and grizzly capital requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event we elect to further expand or accelerate our drilling programs  pursue acquisitions or accelerate our canadian oil sands project  we may be required to obtain additional funds which we may do so through traditional borrowings  offerings of debt or equity securities or other means  including the sale of assets 
needed capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may be required to delay or curtail implementation of our business plan or not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us 
commodity price risk the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per bbl in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in september to a high of per mmbtu in december on december   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  during  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production at a weighted average price of per barrel before transportation costs 
we delivered approximately of our production under these agreements 
initially  for the period january through december  we had entered into agreements to sell  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel before transportation costs 
in december  we terminated these forward sales contracts in exchange for million in cash 
subsequently  we entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs  for the period april to august we also entered into forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs  for the period september to december in  we terminated forward sales contracts for the months of march and may

commitments in connection with the acquisition in of the remaining interest in the wcbb properties  we assumed the seller s chevron obligation to contribute approximately  per month through march  to a plugging and abandonment trust and the obligation to plug a minimum of wells per year for years commencing march  chevron retained a security interest in production from these properties until abandonment obligations to chevron have been fulfilled 
beginning in march  we became entitled to access the trust for use in plugging and abandonment charges associated with the property

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of declining current production  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  technical advances affecting energy consumption  risks associated with operating drilling rigs  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per bbl in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in september to a high of per mmbtu in december on december   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations
