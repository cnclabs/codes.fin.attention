item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview operational overview 
we are a leading global distributor of professional grade handheld test and measurement instruments and accredited provider of calibration  repair and weighing system services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our product segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement instruments 
additionally  because we specialize in handheld test and measurement instruments  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to aid them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
sales in our product segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as customers increase or decrease capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables  but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
our strength in our service segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our service segment offers an opportunity for long term growth and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers with regular calibration cycles 
we evaluate revenue growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  and not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
in evaluating our results for fiscal year  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year operating results include those of united scale  a wisconsin based supplier and servicer of industrial scales and weighing systems  from the date of acquisition on january  
table of contents fiscal year operating results include a full year of operations from westcon  whereas  fiscal year operating results include those of westcon from the date of acquisition on august  fiscal year net income includes a million reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we reversed the allowance after an evaluation of the status of our foreign tax credits and the likelihood that these credits would be utilized prior to their expiration 
net revenue for fiscal year was million  a increase compared with net revenue of million for fiscal year product segment sales increased to million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year of our product segment sales in fiscal year  were sold directly to end user customers while were to resellers compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year domestic sales comprised of the total product segment sales in fiscal year  while were to canada and were to other international markets 
service segment revenue increased to million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year of our service segment revenue in fiscal year  was generated by our calibration centers of excellence while was generated through subcontracted third party vendors  compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year gross margin for fiscal year was  a basis point decline compared with gross margin of in fiscal year product segment gross margin was in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year  while service segment gross margin improved to in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year operating expenses were million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year compared with million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year operating income was million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our major catalogs and intangible assets  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to revenues over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of revenues and or the historical rate of returns 

table of contents inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 
property and equipment  depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in the procurement and development of computer software used for internal purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no impairment existed as of march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were million as of march  and march  deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
if necessary  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized based on an assessment of both positive and negative evidence 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards by recognizing  on a straight line basis  the unamortized grant date fair value over the remaining service period of each award 
excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock awards are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not capitalize any stock based compensation costs as part of an asset 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience 
options generally vest over a period of up to four years  using either a graded schedule or on a straight line basis  and expire ten years from the date of grant 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  options granted to executive officers vest using a graded schedule of in the first year  in each of the second and third years  and in the fourth year 
prior options granted to executive officers vested equally over three years 
the expense relating to these executive officer options is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal years and  we granted performance based restricted stock awards in place of options as a primary component of executive compensation 
the performance based restricted stock awards vest after three years subject to certain cumulative diluted earnings per share growth targets over the eligible three year period 
during the second quarter of fiscal year and in conjunction with the acquisition of westcon  we modified these awards by increasing the cumulative diluted earnings per share growth performance condition 
the modification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost ultimately recognized for these performance based restricted awards will equal the grant date fair market value of the award that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance conditions 
on an interim basis  we record compensation cost based on an assessment of the probability of achieving the performance conditions 
at march   we estimated the probability of achievement for these performance based awards granted in fiscal year and to be and of the target level  respectively 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
product sales are recorded when a product s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or other activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
we generally invoice our customers for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded based upon historical data 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
reclassification of amounts 
certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal years have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal year 
in addition  certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal quarters have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal quarters

our fiscal years and product sales in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales growth decline product net sales per day declined in both the first and second quarter of fiscal year when compared against the same quarter in the prior fiscal year  a direct result of the economy 
as the economy began to improve in the second half of fiscal year  we experienced growth in daily sales volume for both the third 
table of contents and fourth quarters of fiscal year when compared against the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year our product sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day the increase in product net sales was primarily due to increased sales in the wind energy industry 
during fiscal year  product sales to the wind energy industry were million  or of net product sales 
the sales growth achieved in the wind energy industry was partially offset by a decline in sales to non wind energy customers within our direct channel as a result of the economic climate experienced during fiscal year as economic conditions improved in the latter part of fiscal year  the second half year over year sales growth did not fully offset the sales decline from the first half 
during the first half of fiscal  non wind sales to our direct channel declined  when compared to the first half of fiscal year during the second half of fiscal year  non wind sales to our direct channel increased  when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
sales to our reseller channel were relatively consistent from fiscal year to fiscal year the following table presents the percent of net sales for our significant product distribution channels for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and fy fy q q q q q q q q percent of net sales direct reseller freight billed to customer customer product orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory  customized products  and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock 
pending product shipments are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our laboratories prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete  and orders required to be shipped at a future date 
our total pending product shipments at the end of fiscal year increased by approximately million  or from the balance at the end of fiscal year the increase in pending product shipments was primarily attributable to increased backorders  as well as million in incremental pending product shipments associated with united scale  which was acquired during our fiscal fourth quarter 
as the economy improved and customer demand in the marketplace quickly increased  manufacturers were slower to respond  thus resulting in longer lead times for many of the products we sell 
the following table reflects the percentage of total pending product shipments that were backorders at the end of each fiscal quarter in and and our historical trend of total pending product shipments fy fy q q q q q q q q total pending product shipments of pending product shipments that are backorders calibration services revenue  which accounted for of our total net revenue in fiscal year and of our total net revenue in fiscal year  increased from fiscal year to fiscal year the growth in revenue is primarily a result of the expansion of our traditional service customer base through 
table of contents new customer acquisition as well as increased in house and outsourced services provided to the wind energy industry 
service revenue with the wind energy industry in fiscal year was million  or of total service revenue 
also  within any year  while we add new customers  we also have customers from the prior year whose calibrations may not repeat for any number of factors 
among those factors are the variations in the timing of customer periodic calibrations on instruments and other services  customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions 
because of the timing of calibration orders and segment expenses can vary on a quarter to quarter basis  we believe a trailing twelve month trend provides a better indication of the progress of this segment 
our fiscal years and calibration service revenue in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons  were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q service revenue growth decline within the calibration industry  there is a broad array of measurement disciplines making it costly and inefficient for any one provider to invest the needed capital for facilities  equipment and uniquely trained personnel necessary to address all measurement disciplines with in house calibration capabilities 
our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical  temperature  pressure and dimensional disciplines 
accordingly  we have historically outsourced to of service segment revenue to third party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities 
during fiscal year  we outsourced of our total service revenue 
the slight increase in the percentage of outsourced revenue is attributable to specific services provided to the wind energy industry  which fall outside our current scope of business 
we will continue to evaluate the need for capital investments that could provide more in house capabilities for our staff of technicians and reduce the need for third party vendors in certain instances 
the following table presents the percent of service segment revenue for the significant sources for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and fy fy q q q q q q q q percent of service revenue depot onsite outsourced freight billed to customers gross profit for the years ended march  march  gross profit product service total total gross profit dollars in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue  total gross profit declined basis points over the same time period 
we evaluate product gross profit from two perspectives 
channel gross profit includes net sales less the direct cost of inventory sold 
our total product gross profit includes channel gross profit as well as the impact of vendor rebates  cooperative advertising income  freight billed to customers  freight expenses and direct shipping costs 
in general  our total product gross profit can vary based upon price discounting  the mix of 
table of contents sales to our reseller channel  which have lower margins than our direct customer base  and the timing of periodic vendor rebates and cooperative advertising income received from suppliers 
total product gross profit in fiscal year was of total product sales and declined basis points when compared with of total product sales in fiscal year product gross profit declined million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year despite increased product sale volume  an increase in price discounting drove the decrease 
the gross profit percentage in our direct and reseller channels declined basis points and basis points  respectively  from fiscal year to fiscal year pricing in the marketplace remained competitive during both the downturn and recovery phases of the economy  and as a result  we increased discounting accordingly 
in addition  total product gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately million less in combined vendor rebate and cooperative advertising income in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year the key driver of this decline in fiscal year was lower point of sale rebates achieved from fluke 
the following table reflects the quarterly historical trend of our product gross profit as a percent of total product sales fy fy q q q q q q q q channel gross profit direct channel gross profit reseller channel gross profit combined other items total product gross profit channel gross profit calculated as net sales less purchase costs divided by net sales

calibration services gross profit increased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percent of service revenue  calibration services gross profit increased basis points from fiscal year to fiscal year despite this increase  margin expansion was somewhat limited during fiscal year due to the volume of revenue growth attributed to third party vendor repairs and calibrations  primarily to wind energy customers  and incremental performance based management bonus and profit sharing expense in fiscal year the following table reflects our calibration services gross profit growth in relation to prior fiscal year quarters fy fy q q q q q q q q service gross profit dollar growth decline operating expenses for the years ended march  march  operating expenses selling  marketing and warehouse administrative total

exclusive of this increase  the remaining year over year increase in operating expense was  an indication of our continued commitment to control costs 
other expense for the years ended march  march  other expense interest expense other expense  net total total other expense decreased by less than million from fiscal year to fiscal year lower interest expense was a result of reduced debt balances and lower interest rates  while other expense decreases were due to reductions in foreign currency losses 
we have a program in place to hedge the majority of our risk from fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar 
taxes for the years ended march  march  provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively

we believe that the overall economic environment  specifically the conditions experienced in the second half of our fiscal year  negatively impacted our overall sales performance for the year 
this belief stems  in part  from the number of notices we have received from our suppliers and customers regarding plant shut downs  closures and workforce reductions 
in the first half of fiscal year  we experienced growth in product net sales compared with the first half of fiscal year  while in the second half of fiscal year  we grew only compared with the second half of fiscal year  including incremental sales from 
table of contents westcon 
our fiscal years and product sales in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales decline growth the fourth quarter of fiscal year was a week period compared to a week period in the fourth quarter of fiscal year product net sales per day increased in each quarter of fiscal year as compared with the same period of fiscal year  except for our fourth quarter of fiscal year we believe this was primarily due to a decline in the general economy 
our product sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day overall product sales from fiscal year to fiscal year reflect growth in our direct distribution channel 
the direct distribution channel experienced a growth in the first half of fiscal year  due primarily to a combination of increased prices  new product introductions by strategic suppliers  increased customer response to our sales and marketing efforts  and growing sales through our website 
direct distribution channel s sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year declined and  respectively  compared to those in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year we attribute this decline to the general weakness in the economy as demand from customers decreased despite aggressive pricing 
for fiscal year  our direct distribution channel gross profit percentage decreased basis points  primarily as a result of more competitive pricing in both our us and canadian markets 
while our direct distribution channel grew modestly in fiscal year  our reseller distribution channel increased  when compared to fiscal year we believe resellers continue to utilize us for our extensive availability to a broad range of new and existing products from within our inventory 
while sales increased significantly  our continued use of a volume based pricing structure allowed us to improve our reseller gross profit percentage by basis points in fiscal year when compared to the fiscal year the following table presents the percent of net sales for our significant product distribution channels for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and fy fy q q q q q q q q percent of net sales direct reseller freight billed to customer customer product orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory  customized products  and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock

these same factors led to a decline in product profit margin from in fiscal year to in fiscal year our product gross profit may be influenced by a number of factors that can impact quarterly comparisons

the following table illustrates our days sales outstanding from fiscal year to fiscal year march  march  net sales  for the last two fiscal months accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding accrued compensation and other liabilities lower payments for employee profit sharing and performance based management bonuses during fiscal year  while accruing for future payments at march   contributed to the million of cash provided during fiscal year compared with million of cash used in fiscal year investing activities in fiscal year  we used million of cash in investing activities 
the primary uses of the cash were million for the acquisition of united scale  million in contingent consideration relating to our acquisition of westcon and million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for additional lab capabilities and information technology 
in fiscal year  we used million of cash in investing activities  of which approximately million was associated with the purchase of westcon 
in addition  during fiscal year  we used million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment primarily for the expansion of capabilities in our calibration laboratories which included improvements to our facilities and infrastructure 
financing activities during fiscal year  we used million in cash for financing activities  including million to reduce our debt 
in addition  we used million of cash for the repurchase of  shares of common stock from beneficiaries of a former board member s estate at a price of per share 
this use of cash was offset by million of cash generated primarily from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants 
financing activities provided million in cash during fiscal year net borrowings from our revolving line of credit provided million during fiscal year  primarily due to borrowings used to acquire westcon 
in addition  million of cash was generated in fiscal year primarily from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants

table of contents outlook with an expanded service capability and product portfolio  we are strategically positioned to further capitalize on our customers requirements for high quality calibration and repair services and a convenient  cost competitive source for a broad inventory of handheld test and measurement equipment 
looking ahead to fiscal year  we anticipate that our quarterly performance should result in strong first half year over year comparisons that will moderate in the second half to be more in line with our previously communicated organic growth rates of low to mid single digit growth in our product segment and low double digit growth in our service segment 
more significantly  we expect that as our top line expands  we will continue to realize the significant leverage available in our service segment and our bottom line should expand at an appreciably greater rate 
capital spending  excluding any acquisitions  is expected to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by less than million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility  subject to the maximum borrowing restriction based on a multiple of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters  of which million was outstanding 
under our credit facility described in note of our consolidated financial statements  interest is adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio 
we mitigate our interest rate risk by electing the lower of the base rate available under the credit facility and the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of march   the base rate and the libor rate were and  respectively 
our interest rate for fiscal year ranged from to 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
foreign currency over of our net revenues for fiscal years and were denominated in united states dollars  with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar would impact our net revenues by less than 
we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of the contracts  which totaled less than million in each of fiscal years and was recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying receivables denominated in canadian dollars being hedged 
on march   we had a foreign exchange contract set to mature in april  outstanding in the notional amount of million 
on march   we had foreign exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million 
we do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes
