item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if we lose our key management personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  it could adversely affect our results of operations or delay or hurt our research and product development efforts 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our ability to hire and retain management  sales  technical  research and other personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment opportunities 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we may experience difficulties managing our growth  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
it is expected that we will grow in certain areas of our operations as we develop and  assuming receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals  market our products 
we will therefore need to recruit personnel  particularly sales and marketing personnel  and expand our capabilities  which may strain our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to compete effectively and manage our growth  we must train  manage  motivate and retain a growing employee base  
table of contents accurately forecast demand for  and revenue from  our product candidates  and expand existing operational  financial and management information systems to support our development and planned commercialization activities and the multiple locations of our offices 
our failure to manage these challenges effectively could materially harm our business 
since we operate in markets outside of the united states and europe  we are subject to additional risks 
we anticipate that sales outside of the united states and europe will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
such revenue is subject to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the following economic and political instability  import or export licensing requirements  trade restrictions  longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights 
these risks may impair our ability to generate revenue from our sales efforts 
in addition  many countries outside of the united states and europe have their own regulatory approval requirements for the sale of products 
as a result  the introduction of new products into  and our continued sale of existing products in  these markets could be prevented  and or costly and or time consuming  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act  and any determination that we violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent that we operate outside the united states  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment 
in particular  we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though such partners are foreign companies that are not subject to the fcpa 
any determination that we violated the fcpa could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be a party to legal actions that are not covered by insurance 
we may be a party to a variety of legal actions  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  stockholder suits  including securities fraud  governmental investigations and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations 
although we have maintained insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  we cannot assure you that such insurance coverage will continue to be available or  if available  that it can be obtained in sufficient amounts or at reasonable cost or that it will be sufficient to cover any claims that may arise 
other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage  or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance and or insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

table of contents we are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for critical components 
if these suppliers delay or discontinue the manufacture of these components  we may experience delays in shipments  increased costs and cancellation of orders for our products 
we rely on key suppliers for various critical components and procure certain components from outside sources which are sole suppliers 
the availability and prices of these components may be subject to change due to interruptions in production  changing market conditions and other events 
any delays in delivery of or shortages in these components could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders for our products 
in addition  these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these components at any time 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all 
any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers 
if we are unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner  or if we encounter delays or other difficulties in the supply of such products and other materials from third parties  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
in past years  semiconductors have been subject to significant price fluctuations 
while we have  in the past  attempted to mitigate the effects of such potential fluctuations  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so or that we will be able to successfully mitigate the effect of future price increases on our results of operations and financial condition

our profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon our proprietary technology 
our profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon our intellectual property rights or misappropriate our technologies and trademarks for their own businesses 
to protect our rights to our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of patent and trademark law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with our employees  strategic partners and others 
we cannot assure you that any of our patents  any of the patents of which we are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to us or which we may license in the future  will provide us with a competitive advantage or afford us protection against infringement by others  or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties  including our competitors 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
effective patent  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we will offer  or intend to offer  our products 
any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could devalue our proprietary content and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or to defend against any claims of infringement of patents owned by third parties that are asserted against us 
in addition  we may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  the european patent office or other foreign patent governing authorities  to determine the priority of inventions  which could result in substantial costs 
if we become involved in litigation or interference proceedings  we may incur substantial expense  and the proceedings may divert the attention of our technical and management personnel  even if we ultimately prevail 
an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities  allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us  prohibit us from marketing our products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain such licenses  we may be restricted or prevented from commercializing our products 
the enforcement  defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  including the united states patent and trademark office s  the european patent office s and other foreign patent offices interference proceedings  and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere  involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to assert against others or defend us against claims of infringement  enforce patents owned by  or licensed to us from  another party  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others 
changes in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
the healthcare industry has undergone  and is in the process of undergoing  significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs 
these changes include legislative healthcare reform  the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance plans  trends toward managed care  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  consolidation of healthcare manufacturers  collective purchasing 
table of contents arrangements and consolidation among office based healthcare practitioners  and changes in reimbursements to customers 
some of these potential changes may cause a decrease in demand for and or reduce the prices of our products 
these changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
in addition  similar legislative efforts in the future could adversely impact our business 
product liability claims exposure could be significant 
we may face exposure to product liability claims and recalls for unforeseen reasons from consumers  distributors or others 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future  and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving those products 
end users of our products may look to us for contribution when faced with product recalls or product liability claims 
although we have maintained insurance coverage related to product liability claims  we cannot assure you that product liability insurance coverage will continue to be available or  if available  that it can be obtained in sufficient amounts or at reasonable cost or that it will be sufficient to cover any claims that may arise 
we may not maintain any insurance relating to potential recalls of our products 
a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could reduce our profits and or impair our financial condition  and damage our reputation 
product warranty claims exposure could be significant 
we generally warrant each of our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer 
the future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material 
a successful warranty claim brought against us could reduce our profits and or impair our financial condition  and damage our reputation 
adverse publicity regarding the safety of our technology or products could negatively impact us 
despite any favorable safety tests that may be completed with respect to our products  adverse publicity regarding application of x ray products or other products being developed or marketed by others could negatively affect us 
if other researchers studies raise or substantiate concerns over the safety of our technology approach or product development efforts generally  our reputation could be harmed  which would adversely impact our business 
inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third party payers for procedures using our products may cause our revenue to decline 
third party payers  including government health administration authorities  private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
while we cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third party payers will have on future sales of our products  there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause our revenue to decline 
we have developed and must continue to maintain internal controls 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its certain limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
as a result  even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in implementing new or revised controls  our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of our common stock may cause the market price for our common stock to decline even if our business is doing well 
future sales by us or by our existing stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

as a result  luxco has the voting power to significantly influence our policies  business and affairs  and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
this concentration in ownership may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common stock

as a result  luxco may vote the shares it owns or otherwise cause us to take actions that may conflict with your best interests as a stockholder  which could adversely affect our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also deter  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
these provisions include limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the authority of the board of directors to adopt amendments to our bylaws without shareholder approval  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals  and the authority of our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and to issue additional shares of our common stock

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in market conditions  quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of strategic developments  significant contracts  acquisitions and other material events by us  our competitors  or our distribution partners  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  changes in the economy and the financial markets  departures of key personnel  changes in governmental regulations  and geopolitical conditions  such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts

overview sirona dental systems inc sirona  the company  we  us  and our refer to sirona dental systems  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries and their predecessors is the leading manufacturer of high quality  technologically advanced dental equipment  and is focused on developing  manufacturing and marketing innovative systems and solutions for dentists around the world 
the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from several trends in the global dental industry  such as technological innovation  increased use of cad cam systems in restorative dentistry  the shift to digital imaging  favorable demographic trends and growing patient focus on dental health and cosmetic appearance 
the company has its headquarters in long island city  new york and its largest facility in bensheim  germany 
sirona has a long tradition of innovation in the dental industry 
the company introduced the first dental electric drill approximately years ago  the first dental x ray unit approximately years ago  the first dental computer aided design computer aided manufacturing cad cam system years ago  and numerous other significant innovations in dentistry 
sirona continues to make significant investments in research and development  and its track record of innovative and profitable new products continues today with numerous  recent product launches including the galileos and cerec combination launched in september  the cerec ac unit launched in january  the galileos compact d imaging system launched in july  the teneo treatment center launched in july and the cad cam milling unit mc xl launched in fiscal year 
sirona manages its business on both a product and geographic basis and has four segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers  and instruments 
sirona has the broadest product portfolio in the industry  and is capable of fully outfitting and integrating a dental practice 
products from each category are marketed in all geographical sales regions 
the company s business has grown substantially over the past five years  driven by numerous high tech product introductions  a continued expansion of its global sales and service infrastructure  strong relationships with key distribution partners  namely patterson and henry schein  and an international dealer network 
due to the international nature of the company s business  movements in global foreign exchange rates have a significant effect on financial results 
the us market is the largest individual market for sirona  followed by germany 
between fiscal years and  the company increased us revenues from million to million  driven by innovative products  particularly in the cad cam and imaging segments and the schick acquisition 
patterson made a payment of million to sirona in july in exchange for the exclusive distribution rights for cad cam products in the us and canada until the patterson exclusivity payment 
the amount received was recorded as deferred income and is being recognized on a straight line basis commencing at the beginning of the extension of the exclusivity period in fiscal year in addition to strong us market growth  sirona has pursued expansion in non us and non german markets 
between fiscal years and  the company increased revenues in non us and non german markets from million to million 
to support this growth  sirona expanded its local presence and distribution channels by establishing sales and service locations eg in japan  australia  china  korea  italy  france  and the uk 
the expansion helped to increase market share but also contributed to higher sg a expenses 
the weak global economy in resulted in a challenging environment for selling dental technology  which impacted sirona s revenue and financial performance 
in fiscal year  total company revenues increased on a constant currency basis  with successful new product launches  including the cerec ac  partially offsetting the weak economic trends 
to deal with the weakened economy  the company undertook certain targeted actions in to reduce operating costs and to increase efficiency on a longer term basis 
while the global economy improved in  it did not fully recover and we continued to experience economic headwinds in fiscal year despite these headwinds  sirona increased revenues by constant currency in fiscal year  with strong growth in our imaging segment driven by our galileos d imaging system 
in fiscal year  our net 
table of contents income benefited from this revenue growth  but also from margin expansion  expense management initiatives  and debt reduction 
our targeted cost saving actions were on plan  and we started reinvesting some of these cost savings in the second half of fiscal year cash flow from operations was strong  mainly driven by higher cash flow from operations and lower interest payments 
significant factors that affect sirona s results of operations the mdp transaction and the exchange on june   sirona holdings luxco sca luxco  a luxembourg based holding entity owned by funds managed by madison dearborn partners  beecken petty o keefe  management and employees of sirona  obtained control over the sirona business 
the transaction was effected by using new legal entities  sirona holding gmbh formerly blitz gmbh and its wholly owned subsidiary sirona dental services gmbh  to acquire of the interest in sirona dental systems beteiligungs und verwaltungs gmbh  the former parent of the sirona business through a leveraged buy out transaction the mdp transaction 
the assets and liabilities acquired in the mdp transaction and the exchange were partially stepped up to fair value  and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d  which were expensed at the date of closing of the mdp transaction and the exchange  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sirona s cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expense and operating result have been and will continue to be materially affected by depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the step up to fair value of sirona s assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rate although the us dollar is sirona s reporting currency  its functional currencies vary depending on the country of operation 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of sirona s revenue and approximately of its expenses were in euro 
during the periods under review  the us dollar euro exchange rate has fluctuated significantly  thereby impacting sirona s financial results 
between october  and september   the us dollar euro exchange rate used to calculate items included in sirona s financial statements varied from a low of to a high of 
although sirona does not apply hedge accounting  sirona has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure 
as of september   these contracts had notional amounts totaling million 
as these agreements are relatively short term generally six months  continued fluctuation in the us dollar euro exchange rate could materially affect sirona s results of operations 
certain revenue information above and under results of operations below is presented on a constant currency basis 
this information is a non gaap financial measure 
sirona supplementally presents revenue on a constant currency basis because it believes this information facilitates a comparison of sirona s operating results from period to period without regard to changes resulting solely from fluctuations in currency rates 
sirona calculates constant currency revenue growth by comparing current period revenues to prior period revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar euro average foreign exchange rate for each month of the current period 
the average exchange rate for the fiscal year ended september   was and varied from to 
for the fiscal year ended september   the weighted average quarterly exchange rate used in converting euro denominated revenues into us dollars in the company s financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap was based on the average of the exchange rates for the individual quarters included within the year 
loans made to sirona under the senior facilities agreement entered into on november  are denominated in the functional currency of the respective borrowers 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our senior facilities agreement 
however  intra group loans are denominated in the functional currency of only one of the parties to the loan agreements 
where intra group loans are of a long term investment nature  the potential non cash fluctuations in exchange rates are reflected within other comprehensive income 
these fluctuations may be significant in any period due to changes in the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar 

table of contents fluctuations in quarterly operating results sirona s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  many of which are substantially outside its control  including the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  timing of industry tradeshows  particularly the international dental show  changes in relationships with distributors  developments in government reimbursement policies  changes in product mix  our ability to supply products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in manufacturing costs  tax incentives  currency fluctuations  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries 
due to the variations which sirona has experienced in its quarterly operating results  it does not believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations of sirona are necessarily meaningful or reliable as indicators of future performance 
effective tax rate sirona s effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
as a global enterprise  the company s effective tax rate is affected by many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the actual distribution of profits across the different jurisdictions  tax planning initiatives  varying local tax rates  tax characteristics of income  as well as the timing and deductibility of expenses for tax purposes 
the distribution of lower taxed foreign earnings to the us would generally increase the company s effective tax rate

table of contents other financial data year ended september  year ended september  year ended september  s net income attributable to sirona dental systems  inc net interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation amortization ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is reconciled to net income  its most directly comparable us gaap measure  in the accompanying financial tables 
ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
sirona s management utilizes ebitda as an operating performance measure in conjunction with us gaap measures  such as net income and gross margin calculated in conformity with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to sirona s earnings to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because sirona has borrowed money in order to finance its operations  interest expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because sirona uses capital and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  and tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of sirona s operations  tax expense is a necessary element of costs and impacts sirona s ability to operate 
in addition  other companies may define ebitda differently 
ebitda  as well as the other information in this filing  should be read in conjunction with sirona s consolidated financial statements and footnotes

sirona s management believes that these items are either nonrecurring or non cash in nature  and should be considered by investors in assessing sirona s financial condition  operating performance and underlying strength 
sirona s management uses ebitda together with this supplemental information as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and as one of the primary measures to  among other things i monitor and evaluate the performance of sirona s business operations  ii facilitate management s internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of sirona s business operations  iii facilitate management s external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels  iv analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments  and

defined benefit pension costs are determined by using an actuarial method  which provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses in excess of a specified corridor that result from changes in assumptions or actual experience differing from that assumed 
costs relating to changes in the benefit plan as well as the transition obligation are amortized 
disclosure of the components of periodic pension cost is also required 
when purchase accounting is applied  pension liabilities are recognized for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 

table of contents the key assumption used in the actuarial calculations for the defined benefit pension plans is the selection of the appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate has been selected by reference to market interest rates 
the discount rate used reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income investment of appropriate duration at the measurement dates of each year 
fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the discount rate assumption changed from at september  to at september   thereby affecting the amount of pension obligation recorded at september  plan assets consist of insurance policies with a guaranteed minimum return by the insurance company and an excess profit participation feature for a portion of the benefits 
sirona pays the premiums on the insurance policies but does not manage the investment of the funds  the insurance company makes all decisions on investment of funds  including the allocation to asset groups 
the fair value of the plan assets such as equity securities  fixed income investments  and others is based on the cash surrender values reported by the insurance company 
contributions made to the defined contribution pension plans and the k savings plan for us employees are accrued based on the contributions required by the plan 
the company also has an early retirement plan  altersteilzeit atz  which allows certain german employees who have been accepted into the plan to retire at rather than at the legal retirement age of eligible employees are those who have attained the age of by calendar year and have been accepted to participate in the atz plan 
the atz plan can cover a period between the ages of to of the participating employees and is split into an active service period  where the employees work full time for the company  and an inactive service period  where the employees do not work for the company 
during the active service period  the employees receive of their salary and the remaining of their salary  plus a bonus payment equal to of their salary is paid during the inactive service period 
the company recognizes the salary component of the atz plan over the period from the beginning of the atz period to the end of the active service period 
the company recognizes the bonus component over the period from the point at which the employee signs the atz contract until the end of the active service period 
income taxes sirona recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
sirona regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance  as necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if sirona is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  it could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   sirona had recorded valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
further information on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
effective at the beginning of fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of asc  income taxes 
further information may be found in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of asc and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
impairment of long lived and finite lived assets sirona assesses all its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
sirona s management assesses whether there has been an impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of the asset 
the factors considered by 
table of contents sirona s management in this assessment include operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
if an impairment is deemed to exist  management records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of indefinite lived assets sirona tests goodwill for impairment annually on september by comparing the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying values 
we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers  and instruments 
goodwill has been allocated to reporting units for impairment testing 
goodwill may be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment 
in this second step  a fair value exercise similar to a business combination would be performed where the individual identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are valued at fair value with the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit being the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company uses a discounted future cash flow model to estimate reporting unit fair value 
significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow model include discount rate  revenue and profit margin growth and terminal growth rates 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
sirona evaluates trademarks  which are considered indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value might be impaired 
in performing this assessment  sirona s management considers operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
the carrying value of trademarks is considered impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
in such an event  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount of that excess 
key assumptions in determining fair value include using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved
