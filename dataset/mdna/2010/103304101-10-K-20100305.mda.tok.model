table of contents we may incur impairments to goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  or long lived assets 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other intangible assets asc topic  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs 
we perform the annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property plant and equipment  impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc topic  we test long lived assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs 
significant negative industry or economic trends  reduced estimates of future cash flows  disruptions to our business  slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business  have resulted in significant write downs and impairment charges during the years ended december  and  and  if one or more of such events continue  may indicate that additional impairment charges in future periods are required 
if we are required to record additional impairment charges  this could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial statements 
on august   due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at such time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
the credit markets have yet to show significant recovery  thereby rendering financing for this type of development unavailable 
based on our current outlook  we do not expect to resume construction for three to five years 
the change in circumstances implies that the carrying amounts of the assets related to echelon may not be recoverable  therefore  we performed an impairment test of these assets during the three months ended september  while the outcome of this evaluation resulted in no impairment of echelon s assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceed the current carrying value of the assets of approximately million at december   we can provide no assurances that future evaluations will reach the same conclusion 
as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability 
if we are subject to a non cash write down of these assets  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
due to the circumstances regarding the final development plan of echelon  we reviewed our former investment in the morgans joint venture for impairment 
considering the subsequent mutual termination of this joint venture  certain of our contributions  primarily related to the architectural and design plans  will ultimately not be realizable  as a result  we recorded an other than temporary non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  related to such costs 
in addition  during the year ended december   in conjunction with an amendment to the dania jai alai purchase agreement to settle the contingent payment prior to the satisfaction of the legal conditions  we recorded the remaining million of the million contingent liability as an additional cost of the acquisition goodwill 
we tested the goodwill for recoverability  which resulted in a noncash impairment charge of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in aggregate noncash impairment charges to write down certain portions of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets to their fair value at december  the impairment test for these assets was principally due to the decline in our stock price that caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization  which was an indication that these assets may not be recoverable 
the primary reason for these impairment charges relates to the ongoing economic downturn and increased discount rates in the credit and equity markets  which has caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  and has reduced overall industry valuations 

table of contents our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
consumer demand for entertainment and other amenities at casino hotel properties  such as ours  are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities 
for example  the year ended december  was one of the toughest periods in las vegas locals history 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions  effects of the current decline in consumer confidence in the economy  including the current housing crisis and credit crisis  the impact of high energy and food costs  the increased cost of travel  the potential for continued bank failures  perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth  or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 
the current housing crisis and economic slowdown in the united states has resulted in a significant decline in the amount of tourism and spending in las vegas 
if this decline continues  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 
our common stock price may fluctuate substantially  and a shareholder s investment could decline in value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or by our competitors  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  trading volume of our common stock  conditions and trends in the gaming and destination entertainment industries  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets  and general economic conditions  including  without limitation  changes in the cost of fuel and air travel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  shareholder derivative lawsuits and or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
intense competition exists in the gaming industry  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
the gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees  including those at the management level 
we compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation destinations  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses  and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
we have invested in expanding existing facilities  developing new facilities  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets 
in addition  our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
in addition  competition may intensify if our competitors commit additional resources to aggressive pricing and promotional activities in order to attract customers 

table of contents if our competitors operate more successfully than we do  if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion  if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees  if their properties are enhanced or expanded  if they operate in jurisdictions that gives them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes  or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business  we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees 
in particular  the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
expansion of native american gaming in areas located near our properties  or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  increased competition from federally recognized native american tribes near blue chip has had a negative impact on our results 
native american gaming facilities typically have a significant operating advantage over our properties due to lower gaming taxes  allowing those facilities to market more aggressively and to expand or update their facilities at an accelerated rate 
although we have expanded our facility at blue chip in an effort to be more competitive in this market  these competing native american properties could continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of blue chip 
our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
we regularly evaluate expansion  development  investment and renovation opportunities 
on january   we announced our planned las vegas strip development  echelon  which represents the largest and most expensive development project we have undertaken to date 
this project and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise  including unanticipated design  construction  regulatory  environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects 
our current and future projects could also experience delays and significant cost increases  shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  poor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental  permitting  construction or geological problems  and weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses 
the completion dates of any of our projects could differ significantly from expectations for construction related or other reasons 
for example  on august   we announced that  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  our echelon project would be delayed 
based on our current outlook  we do not anticipate that we will resume construction on our echelon development project for three to five years 

table of contents in addition  actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations 
our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors 
many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion 
for example  prior to delaying construction at echelon  we announced that the estimated cost of the wholly owned portion of echelon increased by approximately billion  principally as a result of additional scope  larger guest rooms and suites  and increased estimated construction costs  and that the estimated development costs associated with certain joint venture properties to be developed and constructed in connection with echelon increased by approximately million 
we have incurred significant incremental costs in connection with delaying construction of echelon and anticipate that additional cost increases could continue to occur if and when we recommence development of echelon 
additional costs upon restarting construction of echelon could include  without limitation  costs associated with remobilization  changes in design  increases in material  labor  or insurance costs  construction code changes during the delay period  corrosive damage risk  damage to uncompleted structures  etc 
the cost of any project may vary significantly from initial budget expectations and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available 
we can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets  or that any project will result in increased earnings to us 
significant delays  cost overruns  or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in april we entered into an energy services agreement with las vegas energy partners  llc lve to construct a central energy center in connection with our echelon project 
lve has currently suspended construction of the central energy center while the echelon project is delayed 
on april   lve notified us that  in its view  echelon would be in breach of the energy services agreement unless echelon recommenced and proceeded with construction by may  we believe that lve s position is without merit  however  in the event of litigation  we cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome nor estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any  associated with this matter 
certain permits  licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained 
the scope of the approvals required for expansion  development  investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals  state and local land use permits and building and zoning permits 
unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities 
we may not obtain the necessary permits  licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frames  or at all 
in addition  although we design our projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations  expansion and renovation projects require  from time to time  all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted 
for example  to make way for the development of echelon  we closed stardust in november and demolished the property in march any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities 
for example  in  we completed the barbary coast exchange transaction and completed the acquisition of dania jai alai 
in january  we completed the hotel construction project at blue chip 
we may also pursue expansion opportunities  including joint ventures  in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
the expansion of our operations  whether through acquisitions  development or internal growth  could divert management s attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs  including legal  professional and consulting fees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing 
table of contents operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved 
ballot measures or other voter approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming  or certain types of gaming such as slots  was not previously permitted could be challenged  and  if such challenges are successful  these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans  and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
on august   we announced that  due to the difficult environment in both the capital markets and the economy  our echelon project would be delayed 
based on our current outlook  we do not anticipate that echelon will resume construction for three to five years 
we can provide no assurances regarding the timing or effects of our delay of construction at echelon and when  or if  construction will recommence  or the effect that such delay will have on our business  operations or financial condition 
in addition  our agreements or arrangements with third parties could require additional fees or terms in connection with modifying their agreements that may be unfavorable to us  and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to reach agreement on any modified terms 
additionally  in february  management determined to indefinitely postpone redevelopment of our dania jai alai facility  and in connection with that determination we recorded an million noncash impairment charge to write off dania jai alai s intangible license rights and to write down its property and equipment to their estimated fair values 
our decision to postpone the development was based on numerous factors  including the introduction of expanded gaming at a nearby native american casino  the potential for additional casino gaming venues in florida  and the existing broward county pari mutuel casinos performing below our expectations for the market 
there can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake  which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  reducing the amount or suspending or discontinuing the distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying our bank credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
recently  there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund our currently active expansion projects using cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility to the extent that availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
in addition  we have previously submitted nonbinding indications of interest to station casinos  inc station  and have noted that  if a transaction to acquire any of station s assets were to occur  we would use availability under our bank credit facility to finance any transaction which would reduce the availability of funds for other uses 

table of contents if availability under our bank credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
if we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against treasure chest casino  we may potentially lose our ability to operate the treasure chest casino property and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on september   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court has yet to issues a ruling 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  as well as federal  state and local laws affecting business in general  which may harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
regulatory authorities at the federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is included in exhibit to this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
regulation of smoking if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate  such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that  if 
table of contents enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
legislation of this type may be enacted in the future 
for example  each of new jersey and illinois has adopted laws that significantly restrict  or otherwise ban  smoking at our properties in those jurisdictions 
the new jersey and illinois laws that restrict smoking at casinos  and similar legislation in other jurisdictions in which we operate  could materially impact the results of operations of our properties in those jurisdictions 
regulation of directors  officers  key employees and partners our directors  officers  key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities 
if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner unsuitable  we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of their interest in the joint venture 
state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors  officers  key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards 
for example  by letter of july  the letter  the division of gaming enforcement office of the attorney general of the state of new jersey division made a formal request to the new jersey casino control commission commission that the commission reopen the gaming license held by marina district development company  llc mddc 
mddc owns and operates the borgata hotel casino and spa in atlantic city  new jersey and is owned by us and mgm mirage mgm 
in june  the commission had renewed mddc s gaming license for a five year term 
the letter indicated that the division s reopening request was for the exclusive purpose of examining the qualifications of mgm  as a qualified holding company of mddc  in light of the issues raised by the special report of the division to the commission on its investigation of mgm s joint venture with pansy ho in macau  special administrative region  people s republic of china 
the letter noted that the division had found that we had no involvement with mgm s development activities in macau and also expressed the division s confidence that the commission could thoroughly examine the issues raised in the special report as to mgm s qualifications without negatively affecting the mddc casino license or us 
the commission informed us that  pursuant to section a of the new jersey casino control act  the mddc gaming license was reopened on july   the date of the letter 
this was a procedural step required by the new jersey casino control act that does not represent a finding as to the issues raised by the division 
mgm will have the opportunity to respond to the division s report in an open public proceeding  and mgm is currently involved in constructive settlement discussions with the division  which have centered on mgm placing its ownership interest in the borgata hotel casino spa and related leased land in atlantic city into a divestiture trust 
any settlement is subject to both division and commission approval 
related to securing such approval  on february  we entered into an agreement that  among other things  amended our operating agreement with mgm mirage corporation mgm to permit the transfer of mgm s ownership interest of the borgata into a divestiture trust in connection with mgm s potential settlement agreement with the division of gaming enforcement 
the agreement includes the following provisions  among others  that would become effective only upon the transfer of mgm s interest into the divestiture trust and the approval of the new jersey casino control commission  that i we would receive a priority distribution of approximately million equal to the excess prior capital contributions made by us upon successful refinancing of the borgata credit facility  and ii we would receive a payment from the trust equal to the greater of million or of the proceeds from the sale of mgm s interest in borgata 
certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 

table of contents regulations affecting businesses in general in addition to gaming regulations  we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  smoking  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
for example  on july   new jersey gaming properties  including borgata  were required to temporarily close their casinos for three days as a result of a new jersey statewide government shutdown that affected certain new jersey state employees required to be at casinos when they are open for business 
in addition  nevada recently enacted legislation that eliminated  in most instances  and  for certain pre existing development projects such as echelon  reduced  property tax breaks and retroactively eliminated certain sales tax exemptions offered as incentives to companies developing projects that meet certain environmental green standards 
as a result  we  along with other companies developing projects that meet such standards  may not realize the full tax benefits that were originally anticipated 
our partner in the limited liability company that owns and operates the borgata hotel casino and spa in atlantic city  new jersey will be divesting its interest and we may not have the ability to approve the new partner 
we own a interest in the limited liability company that operates the borgata 
mgm mirage mgm currently owns the other interest 
as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the division investigation of mgm s relationship with its joint venture partner in macau  mgm is currently involved in settlement discussions with the division under which mgm would agree to place its ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city into a divestiture trust 
we are the managing member of the llc  and have been  and will continue to be responsible for the day to day operations of borgata  including the operations and improvement of the facility and business 
additionally  we hold a right of first refusal on any sale of mgm s interest in borgata 
however  we believe we will expend managerial resources to effectuate the eventual sale of mgm s interest from the divesture trust to a new partner  regardless of whether we exercise our right of first refusal 
we will not have the ability to select that new partner 
while we believe we will retain direct control of the operations of the borgata  based on our current and amended operating agreement  a new partner may want to negotiate greater rights or different terms 
these negotiations may decrease our ability to directly control the facility and effectively manage our financial risk 
any new partner could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals 
the ongoing operation of the facility could change if we are required to negotiate agreements with a new partner that contain terms that differ from our existing operating agreement 
additionally  in the event that capital markets do not improve and borgata is unable to renegotiate its existing credit facility on favorable terms  additional credit support and or capital contributions may be necessary to fund the ongoing operations of the borgata 
this additional credit and or equity may need to be contributed by us or the new partner  or from both 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be unable to meet the operating cash flows of the borgata  and our investment would be at risk 
additionally  any new partner might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its share of the obligations  which could require us to fund more than our share 
we are subject to extensive taxation policies  which may harm our business 
the federal government has  from time to time  considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future 
in addition  gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees  in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
for example  in june  the illinois legislature passed certain amendments to the riverboat gambling act  which affected the tax rate at par a dice 
the legislation  which imposes an incremental tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues  was retroactive to july  as a result of this legislation  we were required to pay additional taxes  resulting in a million tax assessment in june also  in may  blue chip received a valuation notice indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  at that time  we estimated that the increase in assessed property value could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million for the eighteen month period ended june  we recorded an additional 
table of contents charge of million during the three months ended june  to increase our property tax liability to million at june  as we believed that was the most likely amount to be assessed within the range 
we subsequently received a property tax bill related to our tax assessment for million in december as we have appealed the assessment  indiana statutes allow for a minimum required payment of million  which was paid against the million assessment in january in february  we received a notice of revaluation  which reduced the property s assessed value by million and the tax assessment by approximately million per year 
we have subsequently paid the minimum required payment of million against and provisional bills  which were based on the valuation notice 
we have not received valuation notices for years through we believe the assessment for the forty eight month period ended december  could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million 
we have accrued approximately million of property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely assessment within our range  once all appeals have been exhausted  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount will approximate the actual amount 
the final assessment  post appeals  as well as the march   and assessment notices  which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
if there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
on april   the department filed a petition for rehearing the petition on the decision 
additionally  on the same date the nevada legislature filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the department s position 
the nevada supreme court denied the department s petition on july  we paid use tax  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties and estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in late  the department audited our refund claim and subsequently issued a million sales tax assessment  plus interest of million 
the department continues to deny our refund claim and issued the assessment based on the argument that the complimentary and employee meals at issue are now subject to sales tax 
we do not believe the department s arguments have any merit and intend to file a motion to dismiss the assessment on both a procedural and technical basis 
we are currently in the discovery and deposition stage of the legal proceeding and expect our hearing before the nevada administrative law judge judge to occur within the next six months 
due to uncertainty surrounding the judge s decision  we will not record any gain until the tax refund is realized 
for periods subsequent to may  although we have received an assessment from the department  we have not accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties  as it is not probable  based on both procedural issues and the technical merits of the department s arguments  that we will owe this tax 
the global financial crisis and decline in consumer spending may have an effect on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot accurately predict 
the continued credit crisis  economic downturn and related turmoil in the global financial system have had and may continue to have an effect on our business and financial condition 
we are not able to predict the duration or severity of the economic downturn 
in october  lehman commercial paper  inc lcpi  which is one of the lenders under our bank credit facility  filed for bankruptcy 
as of october   lcpi s commitment under our bank credit facility was million  and as of that date  lcpi had funded approximately million 
following lcpi s bankruptcy  its interest under our bank credit facility was purchased by one of our other lenders 
had lcpi s interest not been purchased  lcpi s proportionate share of unfunded commitments under our bank credit facility approximately million as of october  would have been unavailable to us 
additionally  on november   another of our existing lenders under our bank credit facility  cit group  inc cit  filed for bankruptcy 
cit currently has revolving credit commitments under our bank credit facility of million  approximately two thirds of which is funded 
it is unlikely that cit will continue to provide its proportionate funding  and it is not clear whether its interest in our bank credit facility will be purchased by another lender 
if a large percentage of our lenders were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to us  we may not have the liquidity under our bank credit facility to fund our current projects 
there is no certainty that our lenders will 
table of contents continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our bank credit facility 
if we were required to renegotiate or replace our bank credit facility  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure terms that are as favorable to us as the existing terms in our bank credit facility  if at all 
the significant distress recently experienced by financial institutions has had  and may continue to have  far reaching adverse consequences across many industries  including the gaming industry 
the ongoing credit and liquidity crisis has greatly restricted the availability of capital and has caused the cost of capital if available to be much higher than it has traditionally been 
accessing the capital markets in this environment could increase the costs of our projects  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and our ability or willingness to fund our development projects 
all of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas 
for example  our treasure chest casino  which is located near new orleans  louisiana  suffered minor damage and was closed on august  for eight days over labor day weekend  as the new orleans area was under mandatory evacuation orders during hurricane gustav 
hurricane ike resulted in a two day closure starting september  at treasure chest 
although hurricane katrina in caused only minor damage at treasure chest  it was closed for days as a result of that hurricane 
additionally  at our delta downs racetrack casino hotel  which is located in southwest louisiana  hurricane gustav forced us to close for six days  beginning on august   and hurricane ike led to a second closure from september  to september  the hurricane closures during the three months ended september  totaled days for treasure chest and days for delta downs  including two full weekends at both properties 
in  delta downs suffered significant property damage as a result of hurricane rita and closed for days 
while we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions  our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect  if at all  on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions 
if any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future  or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future 
although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties  which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire  natural disasters  acts of war  or terrorism  each policy has certain exclusions 
in addition  our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss 
our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  certain casualty events  such as labor strikes  nuclear events  acts of war  loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism  deterioration or corrosion  insect or animal damage and pollution  may not be covered at all under our policies 
therefore  certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 
we also have builder s risk insurance coverage for our development and expansion projects  including echelon 
builder s risk insurance provides coverage for projects during their construction for damage caused by a casualty loss 
in general  our builder s risk coverage is subject to the same exclusions  risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
our level of builder s risk insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 

table of contents in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss  we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed 
while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance  this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 
we renew our insurance policies other than our builder s risk insurance on an annual basis 
the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 
our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements 
our facilities  including our riverboats and dockside facilities  are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance 
generally  all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as the result of casualty  forces of nature  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
in addition  our gaming operations  including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions 
we currently conduct our treasure chest  par a dice  blue chip and sam s town shreveport gaming operations on riverboats 
each of our riverboats must comply with united states coast guard uscg requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
each riverboat must hold a certificate of inspection for stabilization and flotation  and may also be subject to local zoning codes 
the uscg requirements establish design standards  set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels 
loss of a vessel s certificate of inspection would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five year intervals 
under certain circumstances  alternative hull inspections may be approved 
the uscg may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry docking facility  and if so required  the cost of travel to and from such docking facility  as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats  could be significant 
to date  the uscg has allowed in place underwater inspections of our riverboats twice every five years on alternate and year schedules 
the uscg may not continue to allow these types of inspections in the future 
the loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
indiana and louisiana have adopted alternate inspection standards for riverboats in those states 
the standards require inspection by the american bureau of shipping consulting absc 
we intend to relinquish uscg inspection and elect absc inspection for our riverboats at blue chip  treasure chest and sam s town shreveport effective by mid the par a dice riverboat will remain inspected by the uscg for the foreseeable future 
absc imposes essentially the same design  personnel  safety  and hull inspection standards as the uscg 
therefore  the risks to our business associated with uscg inspection should not change by reason of inspection by absc 
failure of a vessel to meet the applicable uscg or absc standards would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs 
in  we implemented the american gaming association s alternative security program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities 
the american gaming association s alternative security program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities 
only portions of those regulations will apply to our riverboats inspected by absc 
changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we draw a significant percentage of our customers from limited geographic regions 
events adversely impacting the economy or these regions  including public health outbreaks and man made or natural disasters  may adversely impact our business 
california  fremont and main street station draw a substantial portion of their customers from the hawaiian market 
for the year ended december   patrons from hawaii comprised of the room nights sold at california  at fremont and at main street station 
decreases in discretionary consumer spending  as well as an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices  a decrease in airplane seat availability  or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents  particularly as they affect travel between the hawaiian market and our facilities  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our las vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas  including the southern california  arizona and las vegas local markets 
native american casinos in california and other parts of the united states have diverted some potential visitors away from nevada  which has had and could continue to have a negative effect on nevada gaming markets 
in addition  due to our significant concentration of properties in nevada  any man made or natural disasters in or around nevada  or the areas from which we draw customers to our las vegas properties  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of our properties located outside of nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk 
the outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located  or the perception that such threats exist  including pandemic health threats  such as the avian influenza virus  sars  or the hn flu  among others  could have a significant adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  likewise  adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies in which we operate  whether resulting from war  terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict  weather  general or localized economic downturns or related events or other factors  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the effects of the recession  outbreak of war  public health threats  terrorist or similar activity  increased security restrictions or the public s general reluctance to travel by air  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues 
our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
in addition  our hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel 
while no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date  substantial increases in energy and fuel prices  including jet fuel prices  in the united states have  and may continue to  negatively affect our results of operations 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  of which the impact could be material 
in addition  energy and gasoline price increases could result in a decline of disposable income of potential customers  an increase in the cost of travel and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs 
william s 
boyd  our executive chairman of the board of directors  together with his immediate family  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as such  the boyd family has the ability to significantly influence our affairs  including the election of members of our board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including a merger  consolidation  or sale of assets 

table of contents some of our hotels and casinos are located on leased property 
if we default on one or more leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel and or casino 
we lease certain parcels of land on which the orleans  suncoast  sam s town tunica  treasure chest and sam s town shreveport are located 
in addition  we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the california and the fremont are located 
if we were to default on any one or more of these leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land  including the hotels and casinos 
this would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities 

table of contents we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we had total consolidated long term debt  net of current maturities  of approximately billion at december  if we pursue  or continue to pursue  any expansion  development  investment or renovation projects  we expect that our long term debt will substantially increase in connection with related capital expenditures 
this indebtedness could have important consequences  including difficulty in satisfying our obligations under our current indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limiting  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments contain  and any future debt instruments likely will contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  including providing guarantees or credit support  incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations  dispose of assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in any new businesses  and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates 
in addition  our bank credit facility requires us to maintain certain ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio of to and a total leverage ratio that adjusts over the life of the bank credit facility 
our future debt agreements could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable under our existing instruments 
our current debt service requirements on our bank credit facility primarily consist of interest payments on outstanding indebtedness 
the bank credit facility is a billion revolving credit facility that matures in may subject to certain limitations  we may  at any time  without the consent of the lenders under our bank credit facility  request incremental commitments to increase the size of the bank credit facility  or request new commitments to add a term loan facility  by up to an aggregate amount of billion 
we believe that we are in compliance with the bank credit facility covenants as required including the total leverage ratio  which was to at december  
table of contents debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior subordinated notes consist of semi annual interest payments based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and repayment of our senior subordinated notes due on december   april   and february  for each of our  and senior subordinated notes  respectively 
in addition  borgata has significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to pay dividends back to our company 
borgata s amended bank credit agreement allows for certain limited distributions to be made to its partners 
our distributions from borgata were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
borgata has significant uses for its cash flows  including maintenance capital expenditures  interest payments  state income taxes and the repayment of debt 
borgata s cash flows are primarily used for its business needs and are not generally available  except to the extent distributions are paid to us  to service our indebtedness 
in addition  borgata s amended bank credit facility contains certain covenants  including  without limitation  various covenants i requiring the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  ii establishing a maximum permitted total leverage ratio  iii imposing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  iv imposing limitations on transfers  sales and other dispositions  and v imposing restrictions on investments  dividends and certain other payments 
in the event that borgata fails to comply with its covenants  it may be prevented from making any distributions to us during such period of noncompliance 
borgata s amend bank credit agreement matures in january we may not be able to refinance borgata s indebtedness under the bank credit agreement on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility  in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at each maturity  and cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our bank credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital

item legal proceedings copeland 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on september   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court has yet to issues a ruling 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are also parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business

the following is a listing of significant events affecting our business during the five year period ended december  we began construction on echelon  our multibillion dollar las vegas strip development project  in the second quarter of echelon is located on the former stardust site  which we closed in november and demolished in march on august   due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our echelon development project 
due to the continued deterioration in credit market conditions and the economic outlook  it is unlikely that we will resume construction for three to five years 
nonetheless  we remain committed to having a meaningful presence on the las vegas strip 
during the delay in construction  we intend to consider alternative development options for echelon  which may include developing the project in phases  alternative capital structures for the project  scope modifications to the project  or additional strategic partnerships  among others 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on the project  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project

the results of barbary coast are classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december  in october  we sold the south coast hotel and casino for total consideration of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million 
in january  we expanded our blue chip casino hotel spa through the construction of a single level boat that allowed us to expand our casino 
in connection with this expansion  we also added a new parking structure and enhanced the land based pavilion 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview boyd gaming corporation the company  boyd gaming  we  or us is a diversified operator of wholly owned gaming entertainment properties and a investment in one property 
headquartered in las vegas  we have gaming operations in nevada  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  indiana and new jersey  which we aggregate in order to present four reportable segments i las vegas locals  ii downtown las vegas  iii midwest and south  and iv our interest in the limited liability company operating borgata hotel casino spa in atlantic city  new jersey 
in addition  on march   we acquired dania jai alai  where we operate a pari mutuel jai alai facility  and approximately acres of related land located in dania beach  florida 
furthermore  we own acres of land on the las vegas strip  where our echelon development project is located 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties  which affects our operating results 
gross revenues are one of the main performance indicators of our properties 
our properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow  with the majority of our revenue being cash based 
our industry is capital intensive  we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow in order to repay debt financing and associated interest costs  pay income taxes  fund maintenance capital expenditures  and provide excess cash for future development  acquisitions  purchases of our debt or equity securities  and payment of dividends 
overall outlook we continually work to position our company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives 
for instance  in january  we opened our new story hotel at blue chip casino  hotel spa  which includes guest rooms  a spa and fitness center  additional meeting and event space  as well as new dining and nightlife venues 
in addition  borgata s second hotel  the water club  opened in june the water club is an room hotel  featuring five swimming pools  a state of the art spa  and additional meeting room space 
in addition  we launched our nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program in players are now able to use their club coast or b connected cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our wholly owned boyd gaming property in nevada  illinois  indiana  louisiana and mississippi 
due to a number of factors affecting consumers  including the declining global economy  constricting credit markets  reduced consumer spending  depressed home prices and new us political leadership  the outlook for the gaming industry remains highly unpredictable 
because of these uncertain conditions  we have increasingly focused on managing our operating margins 
our present objective is to manage our cost and expense structure in order to endure the current deterioration in business volumes and maintain compliance with our debt covenants 
nonetheless  we intend to maintain a flexible capital structure for potential strategic transactions that we may undertake in the future 
development activities on august   due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at such time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the economic recession and continued economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas locals region  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
the credit markets have yet to show significant recovery  thereby rendering financing for this type of development unavailable 
based on our current outlook  we do not expect to resume construction for three to five years 

table of contents nonetheless  we remain committed to having a significant presence on the las vegas strip 
during the suspension period  we intend to consider alternative development options for echelon  which may include developing the project in phases  alternative capital structures for the project  scope modifications to the project  or additional strategic partnerships  among others 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on the project  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project 
as we develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will monitor these assets for recoverability 
if we are subject to a non cash write down of these assets  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have incurred approximately million in capitalized costs related to the echelon project  including land 
as part of our delay of the project  we expect to incur approximately million of capitalized costs  principally related to the offsite fabrication of escalators  curtain wall and a skylight 
in addition  we expect recurring project costs  consisting primarily of security  property taxes  rent and insurance  of approximately million per annum that will be charged to preopening or other expense as incurred during the project s suspension period 
these capitalized costs and recurring project costs are in addition to other contingencies with respect to our various material commitments 
in addition to the expansion projects mentioned above  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through the development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  along with opportunities associated with acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities 
results of operations years ended december    and summary of operating results generally  we believe that our operating results for both of the years ended december  and have been adversely impacted by the weakened global economy 
disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our financial results 
we believe that recent economic conditions have led to a shift in spending from discretionary items to fundamental costs like housing 
we continue to be negatively impacted by a weak housing market and significant declines in housing prices and related home equity  higher airline fares and fees which impact travel costs  increases in unemployment  and ongoing volatility in the equity markets 
the following provides a summary of certain key operating results year ended december  net revenues operating income loss net income loss based on the impact of these current economic conditions  we believe that we will continue to experience reduced consumer spending  resulting in lower than historical gaming volumes  room occupancy and rates  and corresponding lower profitability

food and beverage food and beverage revenues declined million  or during the year ended december  as compared to  and or during the year ended december  compared to sales were adversely impacted by lower visitation  declining customer discretionary spending and decreased occupancy at our properties  trending from through margins slightly improved during these respective periods due to cost variability and lower consumption and inventory levels

in  write downs and other charges  net  primarily consist of the following an aggregate of million in non cash impairment charges to write down certain portions of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets to their fair value at december  the impairment tests for these assets were principally due to the decline in our stock price that caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization  which was an indication that these assets may not be recoverable 
the primary reason for these impairment charges related to the ongoing recession  which caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  reduced overall industry valuations  and caused an increase in discount rates in the credit and equity markets

income from discontinued operations barbary coast on february   we completed our exchange of the barbary coast and its related acres of land for a total of approximately acres located north of and contiguous to our echelon development project on the las vegas strip in a nonmonetary  tax free transaction with harrah s operating company  inc  a subsidiary of harrah s entertainment  inc harrah s

liquidity and capital resources working capital historically  we have operated with minimal or negative levels of working capital in order to minimize borrowings and related interest costs under our bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility generally provides any necessary funds for our day to day operations  interest and tax payments  as well as capital expenditures 
on a daily basis  we evaluate our cash position and adjust the bank credit facility balance as necessary  by either borrowing or paying it down with excess cash 
we also plan the timing and the amounts of our capital expenditures

table of contents maintenance capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
the source of funds for our development projects is derived primarily from cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
we could also seek to fund these projects in whole or in part through incremental bank financing and additional debt or equity offerings

borgata has significant uses for its cash flows  including maintenance capital expenditures  interest payments  state income taxes and the repayment of debt 
borgata s cash flows are primarily used for its business needs and are not generally available  except to the extent distributions are paid to us  to service our indebtedness 
in addition  borgata s amended bank credit facility contains certain covenants  including  without limitation  various covenants i requiring the maintenance of a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio  ii establishing a maximum permitted total leverage ratio  iii imposing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and iv imposing restrictions on investments  dividends and certain other payments 
in the event that borgata fails to comply with its covenants  it may be prevented from making any distributions to us during such period of noncompliance 
for  we generated operating cash flow of million  compared to million in the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows was due to a decline in operating results in our midwest and south segment  as well as the sale of the south coast on october   the closure of the stardust on november  and the exchange of the barbary coast on february  in addition  our distributions from borgata declined from million in to million in primarily due to a decline in borgata s operating results 
as of december  and  we had balances of cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
we had working capital deficits of million and million as of december  and  respectively

during the year ended december   we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
we are currently authorized to repurchase up to an additional million in shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program 
we did not repurchase any stock during the years ended december  or other items affecting liquidity recently  there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital  with such disruptions expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
despite these disruptions  we anticipate the ability to fund our capital requirements using cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 

table of contents we can provide no assurances that our expansion and development projects will be completed within our current estimates  will commence operations as expected  will include all of the anticipated amenities  features or facilities  or will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our development projects are subject to those additional risks inherent in the development and operation of a new or expanded business enterprise  including potential unanticipated operating problems 
if our expansion  development  investment or renovation projects do not become operational within the time frame and project costs currently contemplated or do not successfully compete in their markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
once our projects become operational  they will face many of the same risks that our current properties face  including  but not limited to  competition  weakened consumer spending and increases in taxes due to changes in legislation 
as of december   we have incurred approximately million in capitalized costs related to the echelon project  including land 
as part of our delay of the project  we expect to incur approximately million of capitalized costs  principally related to the offsite fabrication of escalators  curtain wall and a skylight 
in addition  we expect recurring project costs  consisting primarily of security  property taxes  rent and insurance  of approximately million per annum that will be charged to preopening or other expense as incurred during the project s suspension period 
these capitalized costs and recurring project costs are in addition to other contingencies with respect to our various material commitments 
see echelon below for additional discussion 
echelon in june  we commenced construction on echelon  our multibillion dollar las vegas strip development project 
on august   due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at such time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
the credit markets have yet to show significant recovery  thereby rendering financing for this type of development unavailable 
based on our current outlook  we do not expect to resume construction for three to five years 
nonetheless  we remain committed to having a significant presence on the las vegas strip 
during the suspension period  we intend to consider alternative development options for echelon  which may include developing the project in phases  alternative capital structures for the project  scope modifications to the project  or additional strategic partnerships  among others 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on the project  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project 
the change in circumstances implies that the carrying amounts of the assets related to echelon may not be recoverable  therefore  we performed an impairment test of these assets as of september  this impairment test was comprised of a future undiscounted cash flow analysis  and contemplated several viable alternative plans for the future development of echelon 
the cash inflows related to the revenue projections for the individual components associated with each planned construction scenario  offset by outflows for estimated costs to complete the development and ongoing and maintenance and operating costs 
because no specific strategic plan can be determined with certainty at this time  the analysis considered the net cash flows related to each alternative  weighted against its projected likelihood 
the outcome of this evaluation resulted in no impairment of echelon s assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceeded the carrying value of the assets of approximately million at september  as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability 
if we are subject to a non cash write down of these assets  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
morgans las vegas  llc 
we were a partner in a joint venture with morgans hotel group co 
in december  by mutual agreement with morgans  the joint venture agreement and hotel management agreements with morgans were terminated 
as a result  certain of our contributions related to the architectural and design plans will not be realizable 
accordingly  we recorded an other than temporary noncash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  related to such costs 
the remaining million of our former investment in morgans represents previously reimbursed allocations of shared development costs related to the 
table of contents echelon master plan 
these costs approximate their fair value at december  these costs reverted to our basis in echelon  reported as construction in progress  as the plans to construct the hotels were terminated contemporaneous with the termination of the joint venture 
as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives to echelon  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability  individually  and in conjunction with the overall echelon development 
echelon place retail promenade  llc 
in october  general growth properties ggp exercised its right to require us to purchase its membership interest in our joint venture to develop high street retail promenade at echelon 
we purchased ggp s membership interest in october for million  which represents the return of ggp s capital contributions to the venture of million  plus accrued interest 
we retain all architectural plans and designs for the project 
these assets are including in the carrying value of the echelon development project 
as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives to echelon  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability  individually  and in conjunction with the overall echelon development 
energy services agreement esa 
in april  we entered into an esa with a third party  las vegas energy partners  llc lve 
lve will design  construct  own other than the underlying real property which is leased from echelon  and operate a central energy center and energy distribution system to provide electricity  emergency electricity generation  and chilled and hot water to echelon and potentially other joint venture entities associated with the echelon development project or other third parties 
the term of the esa is years  beginning when echelon commences commercial operations 
assuming the central energy center is completed and functions as planned  we will pay a monthly service fee  which is comprised of a fixed capacity charge  an escalating operations and maintenance charge  and an energy charge 
the aggregate of our monthly fixed capacity charge portion of the service fee will be million per annum  payable for a year period commencing in november until echelon commences commercial operations  we may be liable for an interest during construction fee  commencing december  we are unable to provide the amount of the fee  if any  at this time  as it has yet to be determined 
lve has currently suspended construction of the central energy center while echelon delays its construction of the project 
on april   lve notified us that  in its view  echelon will be in breach of the esa unless it recommences and proceeds with construction by may  we believe that lve s position is without merit  however  in the event of litigation  we cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome nor estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any  associated with this matter 
line extension and service agreement lea in march  we entered into an lea with nevada power company currently known as nv energy related to the construction of a substation at echelon and the delivery of power to echelon 
we have assigned most of our obligations under the lea to lve see energy services agreement esa above 
we have retained an obligation to pay liquidated damages of million to nv energy  in the event that echelon does not physically accept permanent electric service by january  through the substation to be built by nv energy pursuant to the lea 
on august   nv energy issued a letter declaring a force majeure event that extends the time for performance of obligations under the lea  including its obligation to construct the substation from which echelon is to accept delivery of permanent electric service 
our contingent liability to pay liquidated damages to nv energy will be recorded and charged to expense on our consolidated statement of operations when  or if  it becomes probable that we will not be able to accept  in accordance with the terms of the lea  permanent electric service from a substation when built by nv energy 
construction agreements 
we have exercised our rights under our standard form construction contracts to terminate our agreements with our contractors 
with the exception of certain custom equipment orders  steel fabrication and crane and hoist rentals  all major construction agreements have been terminated and closed out with final payments made to the contractors in exchange for final releases 
design agreements 
we are continuing to evaluate design services that remain to be completed 
the majority of our design agreements allow us either to suspend performance of the services under these agreements or to terminate these agreements 
in each case  we would be required to pay only for those costs incurred through the date of suspension or termination as well as  in certain agreements  the payment for reasonable demobilization and other costs 
demobilization costs include the removal of rental equipment and the associated termination fees  among 
table of contents others 
the demobilization and other costs are subject to negotiation  therefore  we are unable to estimate future costs at this time 
we have estimated the cost of completion of construction drawings after december  to be million  however  we can provide no assurances that actual costs will approximate the estimated costs 
any demobilization  per diem  and related costs incurred related to the suspension or termination of our construction and design contracts will be charged to the project as preopening expense on our consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred 
sam s town tunica sam s town tunica reported a net operating loss of million for the year ended december   therefore  we tested its assets for recoverability 
the asset recoverability test required the estimation of its undiscounted future cash flows and the comparison of the aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
the test resulted in no impairment  however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica and  if necessary  continue to update our asset recoverability test 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
dania jai alai in march  we acquired dania jai alai and approximately acres of related land located in dania beach  florida 
dania jai alai is one of four pari mutuel facilities in broward county approved under florida law to operate  class iii slot machines 
in march  we paid approximately million to close this transaction  and agreed to pay  in march or earlier  a contingent payment of an additional million to the seller  plus interest accrued at the prime rate the contingent payment  if certain legal conditions were satisfied 
in january  we amended the purchase agreement to settle the contingent payment prior to the satisfaction of the legal conditions 
the principal terms of the amendment were as follows 
we paid million to the seller in january  plus million of interest accrued from the march  date of the acquisition 
we issued an promissory note to the seller in the amount of million  plus accrued interest 
the terms of the note require principal payments of million  plus accrued interest  in april and july  and a final principal payment of million  plus accrued interest  due in january the promissory note was secured by a letter of credit under our bank credit facility  and we have made all scheduled payments on the promissory note  including the final payment in january the carrying value of the promissory note is million as of december  the inputs utilized to value the promissory note are classified as level in the asc topic hierarchal disclosure framework see note  summary of significant accounting policies  as it is not traded and does not have an observable market input 
we have estimated that the fair value of the note approximates its carrying value  based on a discounted cash flow approach  after giving consideration to the short duration to maturity 
in conjunction with the amendment of the purchase agreement  we recorded the remaining million of the million contingent liability as an additional cost of the acquisition goodwill during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we tested the goodwill for recoverability  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million

borgata on june   borgata s second hotel  the water club  held its grand opening 
the water club is an room hotel  featuring five swimming pools  a state of the art spa  and additional meeting and retail space 
borgata financed the expansion from its cash flows from operations and from its bank credit facility 
on september   the water club  then under construction  sustained a fire that caused damage to property with a carrying value of approximately million 
borgata s insurance policies included coverage for replacement costs related to property damage  with the exception of minor amounts principally related to insurance deductibles and certain other limitations 
in addition  borgata had delay in completion insurance coverage for the water club for certain costs  subject to various limitations and deductibles 
on august   borgata reached a final settlement of million with its insurance carrier and recognized a gain of million  included in other items and write downs  net  on its condensed consolidated statement of operations  representing the amount of insurance advances in excess of the million carrying value of assets damaged and destroyed by the fire after its million deductible 
in february  we entered into an agreement that  among other things  amended our operating agreement with mgm mirage corporation mgm to permit the transfer of mgm s ownership interest of the borgata into a divestiture trust in connection with mgm s potential settlement agreement with the division of gaming enforcement 
the agreement includes the following provisions  among others  that would become effective only upon the transfer of mgm s interest into the divestiture trust and the approval of the new jersey casino control commission  that i we would receive a priority distribution of approximately million equal to the excess prior capital contributions made by us upon successful refinancing of the borgata credit facility  and ii we would receive a payment from the trust equal to the greater of million or of the proceeds from the sale of mgm s interest in borgata

pennsylvania land on september   we entered into an agreement to sell approximately acres of land that we own in limerick township  pennsylvania for million  before selling costs  contingent upon certain conditions 
in september  we withdrew our application for gaming approval  which led to our decision to sell the land and record a million non cash write down of the land to its fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
the carrying value of the land was million at december  and on november   the agreement to sell such land was terminated  therefore  the carrying value of the land was reclassified from assets held for sale to property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet at december   since it no longer meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale

nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
on april   the department filed a petition for rehearing the petition on the decision 
additionally  on the same date the nevada legislature filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the department s position 
the nevada supreme court denied the department s petition on july  we paid use tax  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties and estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in late  the department audited our refund claim and subsequently issued a million sales tax assessment  plus interest of million 
the department continues to deny our refund claim and issued the assessment based on the argument that the complimentary and employee meals at issue are now subject to sales tax 
we do not believe the department s arguments have any merit and intend to file a motion to dismiss the assessment on both a procedural and technical basis 
we are currently in the discovery and deposition stage of the legal proceeding and expect our hearing before the nevada administrative law judge judge to occur within the next six months 
due to uncertainty surrounding the judge s decision  we will not record any gain until the tax refund is realized 
for periods subsequent to may  although we have received an assessment from the department  we have not accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties  as it is not probable  based on both procedural issues and the technical merits of the department s arguments  that we will owe this tax

table of contents other opportunities we regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities in markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
for example  we recently announced that we delivered a nonbinding indication of interest to station casinos  inc we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  including the outcome of gaming license selection processes  the approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our bank credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
moreover  we can provide no assurances that any expansion opportunity will result in a completed transaction 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year ending december  total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases interest on fixed rate debt purchase obligations entertainment contracts construction projects other other long term contracts total contractual obligations includes interest rate obligations on our fixed rate debt that comprises billion of our total december  debt balance of billion

the future minimum payment due in to the city of kenner  based upon a portion of actual passenger counts from the prior year  is approximately million 
due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of future cash settlements related to our income tax audits  we cannot establish a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or period of future cash settlements related to the million of other long term tax liabilities as of december  as we are uncertain as to when  or if  such amounts may be settled  we have excluded the amount from the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements mainly consist of unconsolidated investments in borgata and our energy services agreement with lve to provide electricity  emergency electricity generation  and chilled and heated water to echelon 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate swaps  interest rate collars and interest rate caps 
our investment in borgata allows us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that lessens our initial investment 
we do not guarantee financing obtained by borgata and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the respective properties 
we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions  as well as indemnification agreements involving certain of our executive officers and directors 
these agreements provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances  which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and intangible assets we have significant amounts of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and we evaluate our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  now included in asc topic and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  now included in asc topic for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of these assets in the second quarter of each year  which resulted in no impairment charge for the years ended december   and  and between annual dates in certain circumstances 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value  less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the 
table of contents asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
if an asset is under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment charges are recorded as operating expenses 
in addition  we are required to test these assets for impairment between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
as of december   we performed interim impairment tests that resulted in a million and a million non cash write down of goodwill related to our acquisitions of coast casinos  inc and sam s town shreveport  respectively  and an million non cash write down of our indefinite life gaming license right at blue chip 
the impairment test for these assets was principally due to the decline in our stock price that caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization  which was an indication that these assets may not be recoverable 
the primary reason for these impairment charges relates to the ongoing recession  which has caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  has reduced overall industry valuations  and has caused an increase in discount rates in the credit and equity markets 
management must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing 
for instance  management must first determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold or abandoned  it is more likely that impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist  which means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
see summary financial results write downs and other charges  net  above for a discussion of write downs and impairment charges recorded during the years ended december   and long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with the guidance in the impairment or disposal of long lived assets subsection of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc topic 
for an asset that is to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value  less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for a long lived asset to be held and used  we review the asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
if an asset is under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment charges are recorded as operating expenses 
capital expenditures and depreciation we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether the expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent upon the assumptions we make about the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 

table of contents derivative instruments we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating to fixed or fixed to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we may designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the hedged financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
we have designated our current interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
we record them at fair value and measure their effectiveness using the long haul method 
the effective portion of any gain or loss on our interest rate swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
we use the hypothetical derivative method to measure the ineffective portion of our interest rate swaps 
the ineffective portion  if any  is recorded in earnings 
we measure the mark to market value of our interest rate swaps using a discounted cash flow analysis of the projected future receipts or payments based upon the forward yield curve on the date of measurement 
we adjust this amount to measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps by applying a credit valuation adjustment to the mark to market exposure profile 
in determining the credit valuation adjustment  we consider the credit default swap rates of the company and its counterparties in each settlement period  as observed on the date of measurement 
share based employee compensation we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
this cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
compensation costs related to stock option awards are calculated based on the fair value of each major option grant on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model that requires the formation of assumptions to be used in the model  such as expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  expected option lives  dividend yields  and estimated forfeitures 
we formed our assumptions using historical experience and observable conditions 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes relating to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates or when potential actions are settled differently than we expected  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the current period 

table of contents self insurance reserves we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for employee health coverage  workers compensation and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events  as well as upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
 the codification previously sfas became effective 
accordingly  the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification tm the asc became the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the implementation of the codification did not initially have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  as it did not modify any existing authoritative gaap 
subsequent to the adoption of the codification  any change to the source of authoritative gaap will be communicated through an accounting standards update asu 
asus will be published by the fasb for all authoritative gaap promulgated by the fasb  regardless of the form in which such guidance may have been issued prior to release of the codification 
prior to inclusion in an asu  the standard setting organizations and regulatory agencies continue to issue proposed changes to the accounting standards in previous form eg  fasb statements of financial accounting standards  emerging issues task force eitf abstracts  fasb staff positions  sec staff accounting bulletins  etc variable interest entities 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas 
sfas is a revision to fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities which is currently promulgated in a subsection of asc topic 
the amendments include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities  a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity  and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable interest entity 
sfas is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november  and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
transfer of financial assets 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which is presently included in asc topic  transfers and servicing 
sfas eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents noncontrolling interests 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for noncontrolling interests  sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
the guidance clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this guidance requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires expanded disclosures regarding the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption of sfas did not have an initial material impact on our consolidated financial statements a variety of additional proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed standards  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of such proposed standards would have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term libor rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon  at our option  libor or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum which ranges from to if we elect to use libor  and to if we elect to use the base rate determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based upon our predefined total leverage ratio 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   however  we believe that this risk is minimized because we monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties to the swaps 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have been required to pay million based on the fair values of the derivative instruments 
the following table provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by the expected contractual maturity dates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
the weighted average variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates 

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our long term debt and interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  for the years ending december are as follows 
year ending december  expected maturity date fair value thereafter total liabilities long term debt including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives derivative instruments pay fixed average receivable rate average payable rate as of december   our long term variable rate borrowings represented approximately of our total long term debt 
based on december  debt levels  a basis point change in libor or the base rate would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately million 
the following table provides other information about our long term debt at december  outstanding face amount carrying value estimated fair value fair value hierarchy in thousands bank credit facility    level senior subordinated notes due    level senior subordinated notes due    level senior subordinated notes due    level other    level total long term debt the estimated fair value of our bank credit facility is based on a relative value analysis performed on or about december  the estimated fair values of our senior subordinated notes are based on quoted market prices as of december  debt included in the other category is fixed rate debt that is due march and is not traded and does not have an observable market input  therefore  we have estimated its fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach  after giving consideration to the changes in market rates of interest  creditworthiness of both parties  and credit spreads
