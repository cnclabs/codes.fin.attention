item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of customers  so that the loss of any one of these customers could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits 
a majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of systems and solutions to a small number of customers that consist primarily of automotive manufacturers and suppliers in north america  western europe and asia 
the remainder of our revenues are derived from the sale of commercial products to a small number of large customers engaged in the global distribution of commercial tools and products 
with such a large percentage of our revenues coming from such a small and highly concentrated group of customers  we are susceptible to a substantial risk of losing revenues if these customers stop purchasing our products or reduce their purchases of our products 
in addition  we have no control over whether these customers will continue to purchase our products  systems and solutions in volumes or at prices sufficient to generate profits for us 
we may also need to liquidate any excess inventory at prices below our normal margins 
our future commercial success depends upon our ability to maintain a competitive technological position in our markets  which are characterized by continual technological change 
technology plays a key role in the systems and solutions that we produce 
our ability to sell our products to customers is directly influenced by the technology used in our systems and solutions 
with the rapid pace at which technology is changing  there is a possibility that our customers may require more technologically advanced systems and solutions than what we may be capable of producing 
technological developments could render actual and proposed products or technologies of ours uneconomical or obsolete 
there also is a possibility that we may not be able to keep pace with our competitors products 
in that case  our competitors may make technological improvements to their products that make them more desirable than our products 
our near term focus for growth has been and will be on the successful introduction of new commercial products  and the continued development of enhanced versions of our scanworks and autogauge product lines 
our growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products that include the latest technological advances and customer requirements 
we may not be able to introduce new products successfully or achieve market acceptance for such products 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
accordingly  we believe that our future commercial success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce new cost effective products and maintain a competitive technological position 
we are dependent on proprietary technology 
if our competitors develop competing products that do not violate our intellectual property rights or successfully challenge those rights  our revenues and profits may be adversely affected 
our products contain features that are protected by patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights 
despite these protections  there is still a chance that competitors may use these protected features in their products as a 
table of contents result of our inability to keep our trade secrets confidential  or in violation of our intellectual property rights or following a successful challenge to those rights 
the prosecution of infringement claims against third parties and the defense of legal actions challenging our intellectual property rights could be costly and require significant attention from management 
because of the small size of our management team  this could result in the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations 
there also is a chance that competitors may develop technology that performs the same functions as our products without infringing upon our exclusive rights 
it is possible that competitors may reverse engineer those features of our products that are not protected by patents  trademarks and trade secrets 
if a competitor is able to reverse engineer an unprotected feature successfully  the competitor may gain an understanding of how the feature works and introduce similar products to compete with our products 
because some of our new commercial products are manufactured in china  we are at risk of competitors misappropriating our intellectual property included in those products or reverse engineering those products 
as a result  we may have a more limited ability  and significantly greater costs  to enforce our intellectual property rights in those products 
constant technological improvement of those products will be particularly important to keep the products competitive in their markets 
we could become involved in costly litigation alleging patent infringement 
in the past  we had been informed that certain of our customers have received allegations of possible patent infringement involving processes and methods used in our products 
certain of these customers  including one customer who was a party to a patent infringement suit relating to this matter  settled such claims 
we believe that the processes used in our products were independently developed without utilizing any previous patented process or technology 
however  it is possible that in the future we or our customers could receive allegations of possible patent infringement or could be parties to patent infringement litigation relating to our products 
the defense of patent infringement litigation could be costly and require significant attention from management 
because of the small size of our management team  this could result in the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations 
there are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets  or developing products to compete with our products  which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices 
we are aware of a number of companies in our markets selling products using similar or alternative technologies and methods 
we believe that there may be other companies  some of whom may be substantially larger and have substantially greater resources than us  which may be engaged in the development of technology and products for some of our markets that could prove to be competitive with ours 
we believe that the principal competitive factor in our markets is the total capability that a product offers as a process control system 
in some markets  a competitive price for the level of functionality and reliability provided are the principal competitive factors 
while we believe that our products compete favorably  it is possible that these new competitors could capture some of our sales opportunities or force us to reduce prices in order to complete the sale 
we believe that certain existing and potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology 
this could cause a decline in sales of our products to those customers 
our business depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends in large part upon the continued service of our executives and key employees  including those in engineering  technical  sales and marketing positions  as well as our ability to attract such additional employees in the future 
at times and in certain geographic markets  competition for the type of highly skilled employees we require can be significant 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract new qualified key employees could adversely affect our ability to implement our long term growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to complete business opportunities and acquisitions and our profits could be negatively affected if we do not successfully operate those that we do complete 
we will evaluate from time to time business opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
there can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or will be able to enter into agreements with identified business opportunities on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents there is also no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate businesses that we may acquire due to the significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  technologies and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process may require significant attention from management and devotion of resources 
because of the small size of our management team  this could result in the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations and impair our relationships with current employees and customers 
we intend to finance any such business opportunities from available cash on hand  existing credit facilities  issuance of additional stock or additional sources of financing  as circumstances warrant 
the issuance of additional equity securities could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs  debt service requirements or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets 
if we are not successful in generating additional profits from these transactions  this dilution and these additional costs could cause our common stock price to drop 
we are expanding our foreign operations  increasing the possibility that our business could be adversely affected by risks of doing business in foreign countries 
we have significant operations outside of the united states and are currently implementing a strategy to expand our operations outside of the united states  especially in asia 
our foreign operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in such foreign operations 
for instance  we may encounter fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  differences in the level of protection available for our intellectual property  the impact of differences in language and local business and social customs on our ability to market and sell our products in these markets  the inability to recruit qualified personnel in a specific country or region and transportation delays from our chinese subcontractors 
in addition  we may be affected by us laws and policies that impact foreign trade and investment 
finally  we may be adversely affected by laws and policies imposed by foreign governments in the countries where we have business operations or sell our products 
these laws and policies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
because of our significant foreign operations  our revenues and profits can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
products that we sell in foreign markets are sometimes priced in currency of the country where the customer is located 
to the extent that the dollar fluctuates against these foreign currencies  the prices of our products in us dollars also will fluctuate 
as a result  our return on the sale of our products may vary based on these fluctuations 
we may use  from time to time  a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
these transactions involve the use of forward contracts  typically mature within one year and are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions 
we may use forward exchange contracts to hedge the net assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investment in these subsidiaries 
there is no guarantee that these hedging transactions will protect against the fluctuations in the value of the dollar 
accordingly  we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
because a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders  our revenues and profits may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders that are placed by a small number of customers 
if the timing of these orders is delayed from one quarter to the next or from one year to the next  we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results 
because our order terms vary from project to project  the application of the company s revenue recognition accounting policies to those orders can cause the timing for our recognition of revenue from an order to vary significantly between orders 
this may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the amount of revenues that we earn in any given quarter may vary based in part on the timing of new vehicle programs in the global automotive industry 
in contrast  many of our operating expenses are fixed and will not vary from quarter to quarter 
as a result  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we could experience losses in connection with sales of our investments 
during the fiscal year ended june   our long term investments in auction rate securities were exchanged for preferred stock of a financial services company and a reinsurance company 
these investments have not been registered under the securities act of and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an 
table of contents applicable exemption from the registration requirements 
the issuers of these securities are not obligated to register these securities 
there is no regular trading market for these securities 
as a result  we will have limited ability to liquidate these investments 
this lack of liquidity  as well as negative changes in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities and their credit ratings  has adversely impacted the value of these securities 
in the event that the financial condition of these issuers should continue to deteriorate and or the issuers are unable to continue to pay interest dividends in the future  we may have to record additional impairment charges relating to these securities  which would negatively impact our stockholders equity and net income 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the trading price of our stock has been volatile 
the following factors may affect the market price of our common stock  which can vary widely over time announcements of new products by us  announcements of new products by our competitors  variations in our operating results  market conditions in the electronic and sensing industry  market conditions and stock prices in general  and the volume of our common stock traded 
because of the limited trading in our common stock  it may be difficult for shareholders to dispose of a large number of shares of our common stock in a short period of time or at then current prices 
because of the limited number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the limited number of holders of our common stock  only a limited number of shares of our common stock trade on a daily basis 
this limited trading in our common stock makes it difficult to dispose of a large number of shares in a short period of time 
in addition  it is likely that the sale by a shareholder of a large number of shares of our common stock over an extended period would depress the price of our common stock 
we are restricted under our loan agreement from paying dividends 
dividends are not permitted under our bank credit agreement 
in the event the board of directors decided to declare a cash or a stock dividend in the future  we would have to seek a waiver from the covenant in our bank agreement 
our bank may not be willing to waive the restriction 
as permitted under michigan law  our directors are not liable to perceptron for monetary damages resulting from their actions or inactions 
under our articles of incorporation  as permitted under the michigan business corporation act  members of our board of directors are not liable for monetary damages for any negligent or grossly negligent action that the director takes  or for any negligent or grossly negligent failure of a director to take any action 
however  a director will remain liable for intentionally inflicting harm on perceptron or its shareholders  distributions that the director makes in violation of the michigan business corporation act  and intentional criminal acts that the director commits 
however  we or our shareholders may seek an injunction  or other appropriate equitable relief  against a director 
finally  liability may be imposed against members of the board of directors under the federal securities laws 
we are required to indemnify our officers and directors if they are involved in litigation as a result of their serving as officers or directors of perceptron  which could reduce our profits and cash available to operate our business 
our by laws require us to indemnify our officers and directors 
we may be required to pay judgments  fines  and expenses incurred by an officer or director  including reasonable attorneys fees  as a result of actions or proceedings in which such officers or directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of perceptron 
funds paid in satisfaction of judgments  fines and expenses would reduce our profits and may be funds we need for the operation of our business and the development of products 
this could cause our stock price to drop 

table of contents our profits will be reduced as a result of our compliance with new sec rules relating to our internal control over financial reporting 
beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending june   we were required by sec rules to include a report of management on perceptron s internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements was required to provide an attestation report on our internal control for fiscal in fiscal year and  the company was not an accelerated filer and therefore was not required to have an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls 
however  current sec rules will require such a report if the market value of the company s common stock held by non affiliates exceeds million as of the company s second fiscal quarter in any given fiscal year 
we expect to expend significant resources in future fiscal years in connection with ongoing compliance with these requirements  which could adversely affect our profitability 
if management is not able to provide a positive report on our internal control over financial reporting  and our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to provide an unqualified opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting  shareholders and others may lose confidence in our financial statements  which could cause our stock price to drop 
because of our relatively small size  we have a limited number of personnel in our finance department to handle their existing responsibilities  as well as compliance with the sec s rules relating to our internal control over financial reporting 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  management provided a positive report on our internal control over financial reporting and we received in fiscal an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
in fiscal and fiscal  our auditors were not required to give an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting  but under current sec rules  will be required to do so if the market value of the company s common stock held by non affiliates exceeds million as of the company s second fiscal quarter in any given fiscal year 
however  there can be no positive assurance that  in the future  management will provide a positive report on our internal control over financial reporting or that if required under sec rules in the future  we will receive an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control that we cannot remediate in a timely manner  investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
this could cause our stock price to drop 
if the subcontractors we rely on for component parts or products delay deliveries or fail to deliver parts or products meeting our requirements  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion and our revenues and profits could be reduced 
we rely on subcontractors for certain components of our products  including outside subcontracting assembly houses to produce the circuit boards that we use in our products 
our new commercial products are manufactured by several subcontractors located in china and the united states 
as a result  we have limited control over the quality and the delivery schedules of components or products purchased from third parties 
in addition  we purchase a number of component parts from single source suppliers 
if our supplies of component parts or products meeting our requirements are significantly delayed or interrupted  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion 
this could result in a reduction in revenues and profits for these periods 
the termination of or material change in the purchase terms of any single source supplier could have a similar impact on us 
it is also possible  if our delay in delivering products to our customer is too long  the customer could cancel its order  resulting in a permanent loss of revenue and profit from that sale 
from time to time  we have experienced significant delays in the receipt of certain components  including components for our scanworks systems 
finally  although we believe that alternative suppliers are available  difficulties or delays may arise if we shift manufacturing capacity to new suppliers 
the board of directors has the right to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without further action by shareholders 
the issuance of those shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly and could be used to prevent or frustrate shareholders attempts to replace or remove current management 
although no preferred stock currently is outstanding  we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
preferred stock may be issued in one or more series  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors  without further action by shareholders  and may include voting rights including the 
table of contents right to vote as a series on particular matters  the dividends payable thereon  liquidation payments  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion rights and redemption rights 
in the event that preferred stock is issued  the rights of the common stockholders may be adversely affected 
this could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock 
the preferred stock could be issued to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of perceptron 
this may be beneficial to our management or board of directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt 
our common stock rights plan could be used to discourage hostile tender offers 
we maintain a common stock rights plan 
under the plan  if any person acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  our shareholders  other than the acquirer  will have the right to purchase shares of our common stock at half their market price 
the common stock rights plan discourages potential acquirers from initiating tender offers for our common stock without the approval of the board of directors 
this may be beneficial to our management or board of directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement we make statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  including the company s expectation as to its fiscal year and future new order bookings  revenue  expenses  net income and backlog levels  trends affecting its future revenue levels  the rate of new orders  the timing of revenue and net income increases from new products which we have recently released or have not yet released  the timing of the introduction of new products and our ability to fund our fiscal year and future cash flow requirements 
we may also make forward looking statements in our press releases or other public or shareholder communications 
when we use words such as will  should  believes  expects  anticipates  estimates or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of for all of our forward looking statements 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
because these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change  actual results could be materially different 
factors that might cause such a difference include  without limitation  the risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  including those listed in item a risk factors in this report 
other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake  and expressly disclaim  any obligation to publicly update or alter our statements whether as a result of new information  events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or otherwise 
the company s expectations regarding future bookings and revenues are projections developed by the company based upon information from a number of sources  including  but not limited to  customer data and discussions 
these projections are subject to change based upon a wide variety of factors  a number of which are discussed above 
certain of these new orders have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future 
because the company s industrial business unit segment products are typically integrated into larger systems or lines  the timing of new orders is dependent on the timing of completion of the overall system or line 
in addition  because the company s industrial business unit segment products have shorter lead times than other components and are required later in the process  orders for the company s industrial business unit segment products tend to be given later in the integration process 
the company s commercial products business unit segment products are subject to the timing of firm orders from its customers  which may change on a monthly basis 
in addition  because the company s commercial products business unit segment products require short lead times from firm order to delivery  the company purchases long lead time components before firm orders are in hand 
a significant portion of the company s projected revenues and net income depends upon the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and expand into new geographic markets 
because a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies and are translated for financial reporting purposes into us dollars  the level of the company s reported net sales  operating profits and net income are affected by changes in currency exchange rates  principally between us dollars and euros 
currency exchange rates are subject to significant fluctuations  due to a number of factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions in the united states and other countries 
because the company s expectations regarding future revenues  order bookings  backlog and operating results are based upon assumptions as to the levels of such currency exchange rates  actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations 
overview perceptron  inc perceptron or the company develops  produces and sells non contact measurement and inspection solutions for industrial and commercial applications 
effective july   the company reorganized its business into two operating segments  the industrial business unit ibu and the commercial products business unit cbu 
the reorganization of the company s business segments was in response to the growth potential  increased development and focus that occurred in the company s commercial products since their initial sales in the third quarter of fiscal ibu products provide solutions for manufacturing process control as well as sensor and software technologies for non contact measurement  scanning and inspection applications 
these products are used by the company s customers to help them manage their complex manufacturing processes to improve quality  shorten product launch times  reduce overall manufacturing costs and for digitizing and reverse engineering 
products sold by ibu include the automated systems products consisting of autogauge  autogauge plus  autofit  autoscan  and autoguide that are primarily custom configured systems typically purchased for installation in connection with new automotive model retooling programs  value added services that are primarily related to automated systems products  and technology components consisting of scanworks  scanworks xyz  toolkit  wheelworks and multi line sensor products that target the digitizing  reverse engineering  inspection and original equipment manufacturers wheel alignment markets 
the products of the cbu segment are designed for sale to professional tradesmen in the commercial market and are sold to and distributed through strategic partners 
the company services multiple markets  with the largest being the automotive industry serviced by ibu 
the company s primary operations are in north america  europe and asia 

table of contents in the ibu segment  new vehicle tooling programs represent the most important selling opportunity for the company s automated systems products 
the number and timing of new vehicle tooling programs varies based on individual automotive manufacturers plans and is also influenced by the state of the economy 
sales related to services and technology components are on going and vary from period to period based on customers plans 
sales of scanworks are primarily to non automotive customers 
ibu had consecutive quarter over quarter sales growth in each of the four quarters of fiscal margins have improved as a result of the cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of fiscal despite a decline in sales 
asian sales increased from the level achieved in the and business in this region continues to show improvement 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company moved to a larger office in shanghai and is in the process of hiring additional engineers to support its growth in china 
during fiscal  the company s cbu segment announced that it had entered into supply agreements with three new partners  each in a separate strategic market segment 
cbu has a partner in place for each of its four initially targeted market segments  namely  plumbing  mechanical  electrical and construction 
also during fiscal  cbu announced that the company and ridge tool company ridge mutually decided not to renew the ridge supplier agreement 
the company s new partner for the plumbing market is rothenberger ag of kelkheim  germany 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed product design  development and manufacturing of the roscope for rothenberger 
the roscope is a rugged industrial device that has perceptron s patented up is up visualization technology  and backward compatibility with previous rothenberger imagers 
the unit displays live video images  offers digital zoom  digital panning and captures digital still images for transport to a computer via usb 
the first shipments of the roscope were delivered to europe 
cbu s partner in the mechanics market is snap on logistics company snap on 
during fiscal  the company released several new products for snap on  the bkw  a digital video recorder and a mm imager 
the bkw adds wireless capability to snap on s bk line and provides a larger viewing screen and greater flexibility for mechanics and technicians by allowing them to maneuver the imager independently from where the handheld unit is positioned 
this makes it easier for the technician and also allows a second person to view the screen when the technician is working in a crowded space 
the bkw received a positive reception at the snap on franchisee show in august where it was officially launched by snap on 
the digital video recorder has the capability to record and store images for users of the bk product 
the mm imager allows mechanics to see into diesel injector ports and glow plugs 
outlook the company continues to see signs that business conditions for ibu customers are improving 
requests for quotes are strong 
the company is encouraged by the trend over the past four quarters of quarter over quarter increased sales in the ibu segment 
the company continues to see increased interest from customers in the enhanced functionality that was recently incorporated into the autogauge plus product 
ibu sales are expected to show modest growth in fiscal over fiscal sales in china are expected to show strong growth while sales in the americas and europe are expected to be relatively flat 
in line with the company s strategic plans  the company decided in the second half of fiscal to accelerate its investment in new product development in its ibu segment by contracting with additional temporary engineering resources 
it is expected that the additional resources will be needed throughout the first six months of fiscal and then these additional expenses should begin to decline in the second half of fiscal cbu sales are expected to show double digit growth in fiscal compared to fiscal  particularly once sales begin to all four of the division s strategic partners 
sales of the roscope to rothenberger  which began at the very end of june  are expected to occur throughout fiscal sales of the bkw wireless visual inspection product also began in june and are expected to continue 
new products for both snap on and rothenberger are under development and sales are expected to begin in fiscal sales of the first product for cbu s strategic customers in the electrical and construction markets are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal overall  company sales in fiscal are expected to grow by double digits over fiscal and the company expects to be profitable 
the company begins fiscal with a backlog of million which was an increase of million over the backlog at the beginning of fiscal first quarter sales in fiscal however  are expected to be lower than the million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the current timing of ibu customer projects primarily in north america and asia 
cbu sales are expected to be lower in the first quarter of fiscal but increase in the following quarters as development is completed and new products go into production for our new and existing customers 
the company s financial base remains strong with no debt and approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june  available to support its growth plans 
near term  the company will continue to focus on the release of new products in both of its business segments  geographic growth  principally in asia and working with its strategic partners in the cbu 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal year ended june  overview the company reported a net loss of  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  specific line item results are described below 
sales net sales of million for fiscal decreased million  or  compared with the same period one year ago 
the following tables set forth comparison data for the company s net sales by segment and geographic location 
sales by segment in millions increase decrease industrial business unit commercial products business unit totals sales by location in millions increase decrease americas europe asia totals ibu sales increased million primarily due to increased sales of automated systems products that were mitigated by lower sales of technology components and value added services 
the global economic conditions in the automotive industry affected ibu s sales beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and continued into fiscal during fiscal  ibu sales increased each quarter over the preceding quarter

see note and note to the consolidated financial statements  long and short term investments  and subsequent events  respectively  for further information on the company s investments and their current valuation 
the market for the long term investments is currently illiquid 
the company expects to spend approximately million during fiscal year for capital equipment  although there is no binding commitment to do so 
based on the company s current business plan  including the introduction of new commercial products  the company believes that available cash on hand and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund anticipated fiscal year cash flow requirements  except to the extent that the company implements new business development opportunities  which would be financed as discussed below 
the company does not believe that inflation has significantly impacted historical operations and does not expect any significant near term inflationary impact 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of the company s significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties  which affect the application of these policies and require the company to make estimates based on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and underlying assumptions 
in the event estimates or underlying assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in the subsequent period to reflect more current information 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments or involve the greatest uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
revenue related to products is recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
revenue related to services is recognized upon completion of the service 
the company also has multiple element arrangements in its automated systems product line that may include purchase of equipment  labor support and or training 
each element has value on a stand alone basis 
for multiple element arrangements  the company defers from revenue recognition the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price of the contract that is not payable until the undelivered elements are completed 
delivered items are not contingent upon the delivery of any undelivered items nor do the delivered items include general rights of return 
the company does not have price protection agreements or requirements to buy back inventory 
the company s automated systems products are made to order systems that are designed and configured to meet each customer s specific requirements 
the company s technology components and commercial products are sold under agreements with fixed quantities with no rights of return 
as a result  the company has virtually no history of returns 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for non cash stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the estimated forfeiture rate may change from time to time based upon the company s actual experience 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would require the company to reverse a portion of its prior expense for non cash stock based compensation  which would positively impact the company s results of operations 
because the company currently experiences a low forfeiture rate  a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 

table of contents accounts receivable 
the company monitors its accounts receivable and charges to expense an amount equal to its estimate of potential credit losses 
the company considers a number of factors in determining its estimates  including  the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the use of different estimates for future credit losses would result in different charges to selling  general and administrative expense in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
in addition  if actual experience differs materially from the company s estimates  the company could be required to record large credit losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
provision is made to reduce inventories to net realizable value for excess and or obsolete inventory 
the company reviews its inventory levels quarterly in order to identify obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the company estimates excess or obsolete inventory based principally upon contemplated future customer demand for the company s products and the timing of product upgrades 
the use of different assumptions in determining slow moving and obsolete inventories would result in different charges to cost of sales in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
in addition  if actual experience differs materially from the company s estimates  the company could be required to record large losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies inventory 
long and short term investments 
the company accounts for its investments in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities 
investments with a maturity of greater than three months but less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term if the company reasonably expects the investment to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business 
investments available for sale are recorded at market value using the specific identification method 
investments expected to be held to maturity or until market conditions improve are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position if it is the company s intent and ability to hold those securities long term 
at each balance sheet date  the company evaluates its investments for possible other than temporary impairment which involves significant judgment 
in making this judgment  management reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis  the anticipated recovery period  the financial condition of the issuer  the credit rating of the instrument and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for recovery of the cost basis 
any unrealized gains and losses on securities are reported as other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized or until a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded in the income statement 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies long and short term investments 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the estimated future income tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities  assuming they will be realized and settled at the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
this assessment includes consideration for the scheduled reversal of temporary taxable differences  projected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning 
the company adjusts this valuation allowance periodically based upon changes in these considerations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
if actual long term future taxable income is lower than the company s estimate  or the company revises its initial estimates  the company may be required to record material adjustments to the deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to income in the period of determination and negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
litigation and other contingencies 
the company is subject to certain legal proceedings and other contingencies  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the company accrues for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses judgment and evaluates  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by the company  the company would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
product warranty 
the company provides a reserve for warranty based on its experience and knowledge 
factors affecting the company s warranty liability include the number of units sold or in service and historical and anticipated rates of claims and cost per claim 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its warranty liability based on 
table of contents changes in these factors 
if a special circumstance arises requiring a higher level of warranty reserve  the company would make a special warranty provision commensurate with the facts 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to warranty reserves is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it could materially affect net income  and it requires management to estimate the frequency and amounts of future claims  which are inherently uncertain 
management s policy is to continuously monitor its warranty liabilities to determine their adequacy 
as a result  the warranty reserve is maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover estimated warranty expense 
actual claims incurred in the future may differ from the original estimates  which may result in material revisions to the warranty reserve that could negatively or positively affect the company s results of operations for the period
