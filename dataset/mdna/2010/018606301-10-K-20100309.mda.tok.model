item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading national provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services  based upon annual revenue and number of diagnostic imaging systems deployed  and are a provider of radiation oncology services 
our principal sources of revenue are derived from magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography computed tomography pet ct 
we provide imaging and therapeutic services primarily to hospitals and other healthcare providers on a shared service and full time service basis 
we also provide services through a growing number of fixed site imaging centers  primarily to hospitals or health systems 
our services normally include the use of our imaging systems  technologists to operate the systems  equipment maintenance and upgrades and management of day to day shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging operations 
we also provide non scan based services  which includes only the use of our imaging systems under a short term contract 
we have also leveraged our leadership in mri and pet ct to expand into radiation oncology 
our radiation oncology business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance oncology  llc ao  and includes a wide range of services for cancer patients covering initial consultation  preparation for treatment  simulation of treatment  actual radiation oncology delivery  therapy management and follow up care 
our services include the use of our linear accelerators  therapists to operate such systems  administrative staff  equipment maintenance and upgrades  and management of day to day operations 
we also provide stereotactic radiation oncology services through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance radiosurgery  llc 
mri and pet ct services generated and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december   and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  and and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  our remaining revenue was comprised of radiation oncology revenue and other modality diagnostic imaging services revenue  primarily computed tomography ct and management contract revenue 
we had diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology systems  including mri systems and positron emission tomography pet or pet ct systems and served over  clients in states at december  we operated fixed site imaging centers three in unconsolidated joint ventures  which constitutes systems installed in hospitals or other medical buildings on or near hospital campuses  including modular buildings  systems installed inside medical groups offices  and free standing fixed site imaging centers  which includes systems installed in a medical office building  ambulatory surgical center  or other retail space at december  of the fixed site imaging centers  were mri fixed site imaging centers  were pet or pet ct fixed site imaging centers  six were other modality fixed site imaging centers and three were in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we also operated radiation oncology centers and stereotactic radiosurgery facilities including two radiation oncology centers in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which we refer to as wholesale revenues 
our wholesale revenues are typically generated from contracts that require our clients to pay us based on the number of scans we perform on patients on our clients behalf  although some pay us a flat fee for a period of time regardless of the number of scans we perform 
wholesale payments are due to us independent of our clients receipt of retail reimbursement from third party payors  although receipt of reimbursement from third party payors may affect demand for our services 
we typically deliver our services for a set number of days per week through exclusive  long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the initial terms of these contracts average approximately three years in length for mobile services and approximately five to years in length for fixed site arrangements 
these contracts often contain automatic renewal provisions and certain contracts have cancellation clauses if the hospital or other healthcare provider purchases their own system 
we price our contracts based on the type of system used  the scan volume  and the number of ancillary services provided 
pricing is also affected by competitive pressures 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services directly to patients from our sites located at or near hospitals or other healthcare provider facilities  which we refer to as retail revenue 
our revenue from these sites is generated from direct billings to patients or their third party payors  including medicare  which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at discounted prices 
we typically charge a higher price per scan under retail billing than we do under wholesale billing 
fixed site imaging centers and radiation oncology centers can be structured as either wholesale or retail arrangements 
our contracts for radiation oncology services average approximately to years in length 
revenues from these centers are included in either our wholesale or retail revenues 
for services for which we bill medicare directly  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
for example  for  the fee schedule rates were to be reduced by approximately 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of eliminated the reduction for and increased the annual payment rate update by 
this increase to the annual medicare physician fee schedule payment update was effective only for medicare claims with dates of service between january  and june  beginning july   under the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of mippa  the increase was continued for the rest of in addition  mippa established a increase to the medicare physician fee schedule payment update for for  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms are projecting a rate reduction of unless congress intervenes again to avoid the payment reduction 
on december   president obama signed into law the department of defense appropriations act  hr which includes a zero percent medicare physician update through february  this was further extended through march  by the temporary extension act of  signed into law by president obama on march  currently pending in the senate is the house of representatives medicare physician payment reform act of hr  which would prevent the rate reduction by restructuring the formula that forms the basis of the medicare physician fee schedule payments 
if congress fails to intervene to prevent the rate reduction  the resulting decrease in payment will adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
mippa also modified the methodology by which the budget neutrality formula was applied to the physician fee schedule payment rates  resulting in an overall reduction in payment rates for services performed by many specialties  including an estimated reduction for radiation oncology and reduction for nuclear medicine 
the impact of the payment rates on specific companies depends on their service mix 
we estimated decreases in rates for our radiation oncology business  but cannot predict the full impact the rate reductions will have on our future revenues or business 
also with respect to mippa  the legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic mri  pet ct  ct  and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by cms by january  on january   cms initially approved the following designated accreditation organizations to accredit suppliers furnishing the technical component of all advanced imaging modalities ct  nuclear medicine  pet and mri on or after january  the american college of radiology acr  the intersocietal accreditation commission iac and the joint commission 
all our facilities are accredited by the joint commission 
a number of other legislative changes impact our retail business 
for example  the deficit reduction act of dra imposed caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services furnished in physician s offices and other non hospital based settings 
the caps impact mri  pet ct and certain imaging services performed in conjunction with radiation therapy  including certain image guided radiation therapy igrt services and diagnostic imaging services used to plan intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt 
under the cap  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
this change applies to services furnished on or after january  the limitation is applicable to the technical components of the diagnostic imaging services only  which is the payment we receive for the services for which we bill directly under the medicare physician fee schedule 
cms issues on an annual basis the hospital outpatient prospective payment hopps rates  which are used to develop the caps 
if the technical component of the service established under the physician fee schedule without including geographic adjustments exceeds the hospital outpatient payment amount for the service also without including geographic adjustments  then the payment is to be reduced 
in other words  in those instances where the technical component for the particular service is greater for the non hospital site  the dra directs that the hospital outpatient payment rate be substituted for the otherwise applicable physician fee schedule payment rate 
the implementation of this reimbursement reduction contained in the dra had a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in  whereas the changes in and have been limited 
the dra also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts  which was previously announced by cms 
the dra mandated payment at of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and for the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for multiple images of contiguous body parts within a family of codes performed in the same session 
initially  cms announced that it would phase in this reimbursement reduction over a two year period  to include a reduction for each additional imaging procedure on contiguous body parts in and an additional reduction in to date  cms has not yet implemented the additional reduction scheduled for federal legislative proposals have been introduced that would change the percentage reduction from to 
it is unclear what impact this change would have on our business if the proposal is passed 
regulatory updates to payment rates for which we bill the medicare program directly are published annually by cms 
for payments under the physician fee schedule for calendar year  cms changed the way it calculates components of the medicare physician fee schedule 
first  cms reduced payment rates for certain diagnostic services using equipment costing more than million through revisions to usage assumptions from the current usage rate to a usage rate 
this change applied to mri and ct scans  but not for radiation therapy and other therapeutic equipment 
the oig has stated that for  it intends to focus on  among other things  the practice expense components  including the equipment utilization rate  for certain imaging services reimbursed under medicare physician fee schedule to determine whether medicare payment reflects the actual expenses incurred and whether the utilization rate reflects current industry practices 
moreover  federal legislative proposals have been introduced that would result in lower usage assumptions and  if finalized  would supersede cms s regulatory changes 
further with respect to its changes  cms also reduced payment for services primarily involving the technical component rather than the physician work component  including the services we provide  by adjusting downward malpractice payments for these services 
the reductions primarily impact radiology and other diagnostic tests 
all these changes to the medicare fee schedule will be transitioned over a four year period such that beginning in  cms will fully implement the revised payment rates 
cms projects that the combined impact of these changes  when fully implemented will result in an estimated reduction in radiation oncology  reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing diagnostic tests generally 
for the transitioned payment  cms estimates the impact of its changes will result in a reduction in radiation oncology  reduction in radiology  reduction in nuclear medicine and reduction for all suppliers providing the technical component of diagnostic tests generally 
these impacts are calculated prior to any application of the projected negative update factor of related to mippa which may be implemented in april unless congress intervenes and may impact our future revenues 
if the cms reimbursement rates had been in effect for full year  we estimate that our annualized retail revenue related to mri and radiation oncology would not have been materially impacted 
in addition to annual updates to the medicare physician fee schedule  as indicated above  cms also publishes regulatory changes to the hopps on an annual basis 
these payments are the amounts received by our hospital clients for hospital outpatient services 
for  the national medicare hopps payment rate for nonmyocardial pet and pet ct scans was  per scan and the national payment rate for myocardial pet scans was  per scan 
effective january   cms also bundled the pet and pet ct payment for radiopharmaceuticals with the payment for the pet and pet ct scan 
in addition  cms reduced the national medicare hopps rate for mri scans by approximately 
the national medicare hopps payment rates for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery services ranged from  to  depending on the level of service 
for  the payment rate for nonmyocardial pet and pet ct scans is  per scan 
for myocardial pet procedures  the payment rate is  per scan 
for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery services  the payment rates range from to  depending on the level of service 
on october   cms released its national medicare hopps payment rates  which went into effect january  for nonmyocardial pet and pet ct  the payment rate is  per scan 
for myocardial pet procedures  the payment rate is  per scan 
for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery services  the payment rates range from to  depending on the level of service 
combined  the dra and pet and pet ct medicare hopps rate reductions negatively impacted our revenue by a total of approximately million 
for and  however  the dra and the net medicare rate reductions in hopps did not have a material negative effect on revenue and earnings 
at this time  however  we cannot predict the impact the rate reductions will have on our future revenues or business 
furthermore  with respect to the final medicare physician fee schedule rule for calendar year  cms announced additional performance standards for suppliers of mobile diagnostic services 
the final rule requires suppliers of mobile diagnostic services under certain circumstances to enroll in medicare and bill directly for these services  regardless of where they are performed 
an exception was made for services provided to hospital patients under arrangement with that hospital 
in those circumstances  the mobile diagnostic facility would be required to enroll in medicare  but the hospital would bill for the services 
on december   cms issued additional guidance that companies that lease or contract with a medicare enrolled provider or supplier to provide only diagnostic testing equipment and or non physician personnel are not required to enroll in medicare 
the agency nonetheless indicated that it is continuing to evaluate such arrangements 
the new policies have not significantly impacted our business 
over the past few years  the growth rate of mri industry wide scan volumes has slowed in part due to weak hospital volumes as reported by several investor owned hospital companies  a growing number of medical groups adding imaging capacity within their practice setting and additional patient related cost sharing programs 
in addition  there is an increasing trend of third party payors intensifying their utilization management efforts  for example through benefit managers who require preauthorizations  to control the growth rate of imaging services generally 
we expect that these trends will continue throughout further  a number of payment initiatives are being proposed in the imaging area 
president obama s budget for fiscal year includes provisions that may require the use of radiology benefit managers to preauthorize certain imaging services for medicare enrollees 
moreover  healthcare reform under the current administration is a priority 
if laws are passed  certain changes could become effective as early as in addition to the house of representatives affordable health care for america act hr  the senate s patient protection and affordable care act hr would substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for certain imaging services 
also  on february   president obama released a third health care reform proposal  which is currently being considered by congress 
at this time  we cannot predict which of the proposals  if any  will be adopted or if adopted  what effect  if any  these or any other proposals would have on our future revenues or business 
we have experienced and continue to experience an increase in the competitive climate in the mri industry  resulting in an increase in activity by original equipment manufacturers  or oems  selling systems directly to certain of our clients 
typically  oems target our higher scan volume clients 
this increase in activity by oems has resulted in overcapacity of systems in the marketplace 
this has caused an increase in the number of our higher scan volume clients deciding not to renew their contracts 
we replace these higher volume clients typically with lower volume clients 
our non scan based mri business has been impacted by a decline in the number of hospital construction projects  driven by a decrease in new mri systems being added by hospitals in their facilities and a decrease in the number of equipment upgrades occurring in the hospital market 
our mri revenues decreased in compared to due to the factors described above  and we believe that mri revenues will continue to decline in future years 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
added concerns fueled by the united states government financial assistance to certain companies and other federal government s interventions in the united states financial system has led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence  increased unemployment  increased tax rates and governmental budget deficits and debt levels have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
we believe our mri and pet ct scan volumes have been impacted during and will continue to be impacted in by rising unemployment rates  the number of under insured or uninsured patients and other conditions arising from the global economic conditions described above 
at this time  it is unclear what impact this might have on our future revenues or business 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
the principal components of our cost of revenues are compensation paid to technologists and drivers  system maintenance costs  medical supplies  system transportation and technologists travel costs 
because a majority of these expenses are fixed  increased revenues as a result of higher scan volumes per system significantly improves our margins while lower scan volumes result in lower margins 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are sales and marketing costs  corporate overhead costs  provision for doubtful accounts  and share based payment 
we record noncontrolling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investees related to our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries  respectively 
these subsidiaries primarily provide shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging and therapeutic services 
seasonality we experience seasonality in the revenues and margins generated for our services 
first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower than those from the second and third quarters 
first quarter revenue is affected primarily by fewer calendar days and inclement weather  typically resulting in fewer patients being scanned during the period 
fourth quarter revenues are affected by holiday and client and patient vacation schedules  resulting in fewer scans during the period 
the variability in margins is higher than the variability in revenues due to the fixed nature of our costs 
the company also experiences fluctuations in the revenues and margins generated due to acquisition activity and general economic conditions  including recession or economic slowdown

our ability to generate cash flow is affected by numerous factors  including demand for mri  pet ct  other diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is also dependent upon the collections of our accounts receivable

we incur capital expenditures for the purposes of purchasing new systems  replacing less advanced systems with new systems  and providing upgrades of our mri  pet and pet ct  and radiation oncology systems and upgrading our corporate infrastructure for future growth 
capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during we purchased mri systems and pet ct systems 
we traded in or sold a total of systems during our decision to purchase a new system is typically predicated on obtaining new or extending existing client contracts  which serve as the basis of demand for the new system 
we expect to purchase additional systems in and finance substantially all of these purchases with our available cash  cash from operating activities  our revolving line of credit  and equipment leases 
based upon the client demand described above  which dictates the type of equipment purchased  we expect cash capital expenditures to total approximately to million in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  primarily direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at december   we had million in our accounts that are with third party financial institutions which exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets

in connection with the acquisition of alliance by an affiliate of kkr  we entered into a million credit agreement consisting of a million tranche a term loan facility  a million tranche b term facility  a million tranche c term loan facility and a revolving loan facility 
on june   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement and completed a million refinancing of our tranche b and c term loan facility 
under the terms of the amended term loan facility  we received proceeds of million from a new tranche c term loan facility  and used the entire amount of the proceeds to retire million and million owed under tranche b and c of our existing term loan facility  respectively 
the new tranche c borrowing rate was decreased to libor plus 
in december  we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement which revised our tranche c term loan facility old term loan resulting in incremental borrowings of million and decreased the maximum amount of availability under our existing revolving loan facility from million to million 
we applied the proceeds from the amendment to retirement of million of our million senior subordinated notes due the notes through a cash tender offer the tender offer  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amended old term loan borrowing rate decreased to libor plus 
on december  we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement which revised our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant to a level not to exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter until the expiration of the agreement 
prior to the fourth amendment  our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant was to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter beginning march  to the expiration of the agreement 
the fourth amendment also required us to maintain a maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio covenant at a level not to exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
the amendment increased the old term loan libor margin from an annual rate of to 
in connection with the amendment  we incurred an amendment fee of million 
in december  we completed the tender offer and redeemed million of our outstanding notes 
during  we paid the remaining balance of million related to the notes  which had an original balance of million 
in  we used cash flow from operating activities to pay down million under the old term loan 
in december  we entered into a new senior secured credit agreement the new credit facility  comprised of a million term loan the new term loan maturing june and a million revolving facility the new revolving credit facility maturing december borrowings under the new term loan were issued at of par  with the discount to par being amortized to interest expense and other  net through the maturity date of the loan 
we used the proceeds from the new term loan to retire million of our old term loan 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon  at our option  either london interbank offered rate libor or the base rate which is the highest of the administrative agent s prime rate  one half of in excess of the overnight federal funds rate  and in excess of the one month libor rate  plus in each case  an applicable margin 
with respect to the new term loan  the applicable margin for libor loans is per annum  and with respect to the new revolving credit facility  the applicable margin for libor loans ranges  based on the applicable leverage ratio  from to per annum  in each case  with a libor floor of 
with respect to the new term loan  the applicable margin for base rate loans is per annum  and with respect to the new revolving credit facility  the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges  based on the applicable leverage ratio  from to per annum 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the new revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of available borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
in addition to other covenants  the new credit facility places limits on our and our subsidiaries ability to  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness  amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  transact with affiliates and alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries 
the new credit facility also contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain i a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda that ranges from to to to and ii a minimum ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense of to 
within days after the closing date of the new credit facility  which occurred december   we are required to enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts that would have the effect of fixing a specified percentage of our variable rate debt for periods to be determined 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our new credit facility and expect that we will be in compliance with these covenants in however  if we are unable to generate sufficient consolidated adjusted ebitda  as defined in our credit agreement  or manage our indebtedness to sufficient levels  we could be out of compliance with our maximum consolidated leverage ratio and maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio 
our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the lenders under the credit agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreement  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the new credit facility is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under the credit facility 
if we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
in december  we issued million of our senior subordinated notes due the original notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and applied the proceeds to repayment of a portion of our notes 
the original notes were subsequently registered 
on december   we issued an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due the new notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act 
the new notes were subsequently registered 
the new notes were issued at a discount of  which was being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the notes 
the new notes have terms that were substantially identical to our original notes  but were issued under a new indenture and are therefore a separate series of notes 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the new notes to repay and terminate an acquisition credit facility we entered into the previous month to finance the nehe acquisition as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the original notes and the new notes are collectively referred to as the notes 
in december  we issued million of senior notes due the notes in a transaction that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were issued at of par  with the discount to par being amortized to interest expense and other  net through the maturity date of the notes 
we used the proceeds from this transaction  the new term loan and existing cash to complete a tender offer and purchase million of the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  together with the accrued interest to the redemption date 
we also used the proceeds from these transactions to redeem the remaining million of notes in january at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  together with accrued interest to the redemption date 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants limiting our and most of our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments  incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock  create liens on our assets  merge  consolidate  or sell all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates  among others 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are equal in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt  and rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated debt 
the notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness  including indebtedness under our new credit facility  to the extent of assets securing such indebtedness  and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all obligations of our subsidiaries 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the notes and forecast that we will be in compliance with these covenants in our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the trustee under the indenture relating to the notes and the note holders to declare the principal amounts under the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the notes  or any of our other indebtedness  is accelerated  and we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts of million  million and million to manage the future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt 
these agreements matured during we recorded changes in the fair value of the swaps through interest expense 
in the first quarter of  we entered into multiple interest rate collar agreements for our variable rate bank debt 
the total underlying notional amount of the debt was million 
under these arrangements we purchased a cap on the interest rate of and sold a floor of 
we paid a net purchase price of million for these collars 
these agreements were two and three years in length and matured at various dates between january and january we designated these collars as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt and recorded changes in the fair value of the collars through comprehensive income during the period these instruments were designated as hedges 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
these agreements are three years in length and mature in see below for additional information regarding the swaps 
as discussed below  we elected to terminate and replace one of the swaps in the first quarter of on september   lhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on october   lcpi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of our swaps with a notional amount of million  which expires january   is with lcpi the lehman swap 
as of september  hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the lehman swap are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the lehman swap through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the lehman swap was valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the fair market value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million  which was adjusted to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
we included the write down of the asset in interest expense and other for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we replaced the lehman swap with an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million the swap replacement and has been designated as a cash flow hedge of variable future cash flows associated with a portion of our long term debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in january  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which had a notional amount of million to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the new swap 
under the terms of this agreement  which was to mature in november  we received three month libor and paid a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedge was to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus we elected to terminate one of the swaps and the new swap in december in connection with entering into the refinance transaction on december  as a result of the refinance transaction  we de designated the swap  the swap replacement and the new swap and hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the terminated swaps are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the terminated swaps through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the terminated swaps were valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the maturities of our long term debt  including interest  future payments under our operating leases and binding equipment purchase commitments as of december  are as follows contractual obligations thereafter total in millions new term loan senior notes senior subordinated notes equipment loans operating leases letters of credit equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligation payments less amount representing interest present value of future contractual obligations the remaining million of notes were redeemed in january at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  together with accrued interest to the redemption date 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of  at december  has been omitted from the above table because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months  however  we do not expect the change will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations  our cash flow from operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient over the next one to two years to fund anticipated capital expenditures and potential acquisitions and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt 
under current tax law  we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards nols by  and therefore anticipate being in a tax paying position with respect to a portion of our income in however  legislation is currently pending which may extend the federal bonus depreciation deduction through december  if extended  we may have nol carryforwards into we may require or choose to obtain additional financing 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend  among other things  on our financial condition and operating performance  as well as the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
if we need to raise additional funds in the future and are unable to do so or obtain additional financing on acceptable terms in the future  it is possible we would have to limit planned activities or sell assets to obtain liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we were a party to interest rate swap agreements related to million of outstanding principal on our variable rate debt

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenues is derived directly from healthcare providers and is primarily for imaging services 
to a lesser extent  revenues are generated from direct billings to patients or their medical payors which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates 
revenues from direct patient billing amounted to approximately  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continuously monitor collections from direct patient billings and compare these collections to revenue  net of contractual discounts  recorded at the time of service 
while such contractual discounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate contractual discounts in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
as the price is predetermined  all revenues are recognized at the time the delivery of imaging service has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured  which is based upon contract terms with healthcare providers and negotiated rates with third party payors and patients 
accounts receivable we provide shared and single user diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology equipment and technical support services to the healthcare industry and directly to patients on an outpatient basis 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals  other healthcare providers and health insurance providers located throughout the united states 
services are generally provided pursuant to long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers or directly to patients  and generally collateral is not required 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our clients and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon any specific client collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate credit losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
goodwill and long lived assets asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with asc  we have selected to perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the financial information as of september  or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate an impairment of these assets has possibly occurred 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to our various reporting units  which are our geographical regions 
asc requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives within the reporting unit are less than the carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
we comply with periodic impairment test procedures 
in  and we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  indicating no goodwill or intangible asset impairment was present 
no triggering events occurred during the fourth quarters of  and which required an additional impairment test as of december   or asc also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in  and we concluded that no impairment was present in our intangible assets with definite useful lives 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
future income tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that the realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to significantly increase our valuation allowance  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates which are variable 
the recorded carrying amount of our long term debt under our new credit facility approximates fair value as these borrowings have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt 
to decrease the risk associated with interest rate increases  we have entered into multiple interest rate swap and collar agreements for a portion of our variable rate debt 
these swaps and collars are designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
within days after the closing date of the new credit facility  which occurred december   we are required to enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts that would have the effect of fixing a specified percentage of our variable rate debt for periods to be determined 
during we entered into interest rate swap agreements which had notional amounts of million  million and million 
under the terms of these agreements  we received three month libor and paid a fixed rate of   and  respectively 
the net effect was to record interest expense at fixed rates of  and respectively  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
for the year ended december   we received a net settlement amount of million 
the swap agreements matured during the second and fourth quarters of during we entered into multiple interest rate collar agreements which had an aggregate notional amount of million 
under the terms of these agreements  we purchased a cap on the interest rate of and sold a floor of 
for the years ended december  and  we received a net settlement amount of and million  respectively  on these collar agreements 
the collar agreements matured at various dates between january and january during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the underlying debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
for the years ended december  and  we paid net settlement amounts of million and million  respectively  on these swap agreements 
the swaps are three years in length and mature in see below for additional information regarding the swaps 
as discussed below  we elected to terminate and replace one of the swaps in the first quarter of the collar agreements and the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the collars and the swaps are  and will be  recorded at fair value 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the collars and swaps will be determined based on quoted market prices and  assuming perfect effectiveness  the difference between the fair value and the book value of the collars will be recognized in comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the swaps will be determined based on the income approach using observable level inputs under asc formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
the fair market value of the swaps will be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities with all effective changes deferred in comprehensive income 
any ineffectiveness of the collars and swaps is required to be recognized in earnings 
the collars outstanding at december  matured during january  and all counterparty obligations were met 
on september   lhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on october   lcpi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of our swaps with a notional amount of million  which expires january   is with lcpi the lehman swap 
as of september  hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the lehman swap are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the lehman swap through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the lehman swap was valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the fair market value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million  which was adjusted to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
we included the write down of the asset in interest expense and other for the year ended december  for the last three quarters of  we included million in interest expense and other  net related to the fair value adjustment for this swap as we did not expect lcpi to fulfill their obligations under the swap agreement 
as a result  we terminated the lehman swap in february we paid million for the remaining fair market value of the swap at the date of termination 
during the first quarter of  we replaced the lehman swap with an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million the swap replacement and has been designated as a cash flow hedge of variable future cash flows associated with a portion of our long term debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in january  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of

we paid million and million for the remaining fair market value of the swap and the new swap  respectively  at the date of termination 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the terminated swaps through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the terminated swaps were valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
also during the first quarter of  we entered into a diesel fuel swap agreement which has a notional quantity of  gallons  or  gallons per month  to hedge future cash payments associated with our purchases of diesel fuel for the mobile fleet 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in february  we receive the department of energy published monthly average price per gallon and pay a fixed rate of per gallon 
for the year ended december   we paid a net settlement amount of million on this swap agreement 
for the year ended december   amounts recognized in other income and expense were not material 
the swaps expose us to credit risk in the event that the counterparties to the agreements do not or cannot meet their obligations 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received  if any  over the remaining life of the swaps 
on a quarterly basis  the counterparties are evaluated for non performance risk 
additionally  the credit crisis could have an impact on our other interest rate swap agreement if that counterparty files for bankruptcy or is otherwise unable to perform its obligations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
the collars outstanding at december  matured during january  and all counterparty obligations were met 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because the majority of our investments are in cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents are invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  primarily direct obligations of the government of the united states 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  of which million was held in accounts that are with third party financial institutions which exceed the fdic insurance limits
