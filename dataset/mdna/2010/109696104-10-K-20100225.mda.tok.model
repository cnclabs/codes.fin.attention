overview of results versus our revenues and operating profit declined in our segment margin declined in an environment that was extremely difficult for customers in the banking  retail  and diamond and jewelry sectors 
the operating profit decline was primarily due to a highly profitable monetary conversion project in venezuela in  a million repatriation charge and higher retirement expenses  partially offset by a million gain on an acquisition in india 
the million repatriation charge was the result of our decision to repatriate million bolivar fuertes from our venezuelan operations at the parallel market rate 
in addition  newly acquired businesses helped revenues and operating profit in versus brink s delivered strong full year results  despite an extremely challenging business environment that worsened as the year progressed  especially in the diamond and jewelry segment of our global services business 
the biggest contributor to the revenue increase in was million related to the completed currency conversion project in venezuela 
operating profit improved due primarily to the currency conversion project in venezuela and a gain from a sale of coal assets 
outlook for we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid single digit percentage range from our revenue adjusted  and a segment operating profit margin between and 
we define organic revenue growth as revenue growth excluding changes in revenue for newly acquired or disposed businesses  and changes in revenue due to changes in currency exchange rates 
see page for a summary of our outlook 
general overview management allocates resources to and makes operating decisions on a geographic basis 
our reportable segments include international and north america operations 
our international segment includes three distinct regions emea  latin america and asia pacific 
our north america segment includes operations in the us and canada 
we believe that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for a high level of service and security risk management and logistics expertise global infrastructure and customer base proprietary cash processing and information systems proven operational excellence high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength we focus our time and resources on service quality  protecting and strengthening our brand  and addressing our risks 
we are a premium provider of services in most of the markets we serve 
our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the brink s brand  so we seek to protect and build its value 
since our services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  we strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying our approach is an understanding that we must be disciplined and patient enough to charge prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for our investors 
business environments around the world change constantly 
we must adapt to changes in competitive landscapes  regional economies and each customer s level of business 
we balance underlying business risk and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of our resources 
as a result  we operate largely on a decentralized basis so local management can react quickly to changes in the business environment 
we measure financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial measures are return on capital revenue and earnings growth cash flow generation these and similar measures are critical components of our incentive compensation plans and performance evaluations 
because of our emphasis on managing risks while providing a high level of service  we focus our marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of our services  information and risk management capabilities  and financial strength 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital  we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources as well as appropriate pricing levels 
we attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
due to our higher investment in people and processes  we generally charge higher prices than competitors that do not provide the same level of service and risk management 
the industries we serve have been consolidating 
as a result  the demands and expectations of customers in these industries have grown 
customers are increasingly seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
operating results may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  costs are incurred to prepare to serve  or to transition away  from a customer 
we also periodically incur costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  safety and security costs can vary depending on performance  cost of insurance coverage  and changes in crime rates ie  attacks and robberies 
cash logistics is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through bank deposit 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange including same day credit capabilities 
retail customers use brink s cash logistics services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information  and to replenish customer coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash logistics involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are charged higher prices  which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash logistics to customers differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
management is focused on continuing to grow cash logistics revenue 
brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season 
former operations on october   we completed the tax free spin off of brink s home security holdings  inc bhs  a former monitored security business in north america 
on august   we sold our domestic cash handling operations in the united kingdom 
see discontinued operations for a description of the transactions and see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the effect of these dispositions on our cash flow and financial position 
we have reported the earnings and cash flows of these operations within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we have significant liabilities associated with our former operations  primarily related to retirement plans  which are partially funded by plan trusts 
these trusts sustained significant market losses during the second half of information about our liabilities related to former operations is contained in the following sections of this report non segment income expense on page liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations on page application of critical accounting policies on page notes  and to the consolidated financial statements  which begin on page results of operations consolidated review gaap change adjusted a change years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenues segment operating profit international north america total segment operating profit b non segment operating profit c total operating profit income from continuing operations d net income d diluted earnings per share continuing operations net income amounts may not add due to rounding

overview our effective tax rate has varied in the past three years from the statutory us federal rate due to various factors  including changes in judgment about the need for valuation allowances changes in the geographical mix of earnings the nondeductible venezuela repatriation charge the nontaxable acquisition gains timing of benefit recognition for uncertain tax positions state income taxes we establish or reverse valuation allowances for deferred tax assets depending on all available information including historical and expected future operating performance of our subsidiaries 
changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances 
based on our historical and future expected taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
outlook the effective income tax rate for is expected to be between and 
this higher forecasted range reflects the designation of venezuela as highly inflationary for accounting purposes  effective january  this designation precludes the recognition of deferred tax benefits that result from inflationary indexing of assets and liabilities 
the higher forecasted rate is also due to the characterization of a french business tax as an income tax based upon legislative changes  also effective january  our effective tax rate may fluctuate materially from these estimates due to changes in forecasted permanent book tax differences  the expected geographical mix of earnings  changes in valuation allowances or accruals for contingencies and other factors 
continuing operations compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was lower than the us statutory tax rate due to million in lower tax expense primarily resulting from the reversal of a us valuation allowance  million in lower taxes due to the nontaxable india gain  partially offset by million in higher taxes due to the nondeductible venezuela repatriation charge 
see application of critical accounting policies deferred tax asset valuation allowance on page for an explanation of a description of our accounting policy  assumptions used and a sensitivity analysis 
compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was lower than the us statutory tax rate due to a net million decrease in our valuation allowance position in us and us jurisdictions as a result of our assessment of historical and future taxable income in these jurisdictions 
in addition  there was a million decrease in the non us tax provision  primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings in the foreign jurisdictions 
compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to a million increase related to a net increase in the valuation allowance for non us deferred tax assets partly offset by a million decrease in the foreign tax provision primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings in the foreign jurisdictions 
other as of december   we have not recorded us federal deferred income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity affiliates in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for income taxes special areas  as amended  which is now part of fasb asc topic  income taxes 
we expect that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in operations outside the us it is not practical to compute the estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings

foreign operations we operate in more than countries outside the us we are subject to risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments 
changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future effects  if any  of these risks cannot be predicted 
our international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the us dollar 
brink s venezuela is subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted 
see application of critical accounting policies foreign currency translation on page for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our venezuelan operation in our consolidated financial statements  and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a on page at december   no material foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources overview over the last three years  we have used cash generated from our continuing operations to invest in the infrastructure of our business new facilities  cash sorting and other equipment for our cash logistics operations  armored trucks  compusafe units  and customer facing and back office information technology million  make voluntarily contributions to our primary us pension plan million  including million in  acquire businesses million including million in bric brazil  russia  india and china countries in  repurchase shares of our stock million  and pay dividends million 
in addition  we contributed million to our home security business prior to the spin off of the business to our shareholders in during the last three years  our net debt only increased million primarily as a result of million of cash provided by operations before contributions to our us pension plans 
outlook we continue to consider acquisition opportunities in the secure transportation and cash logistics industry our organic growth strategy and in other security markets our adjacent growth strategy 
we may use our cash from operations and borrowings to fund the purchase of these acquisitions 
we may be required to contribute cash to our us pension plans in the future  and the amount of contributions may exceed the amount of cash provided by our us subsidiaries 
we may choose to borrow cash in the us rather than pay incremental taxes to use cash held by certain of our international operations to fund these obligations 
we began translating cash flows from our venezuelan operations at the parallel rate rather than the official rate 
as a result  our cash flow amounts reported for these operations will be lower than the past  and our consolidated statements of cash flows in the future will include smaller amounts related to these operations  which will affect the comparability of these statements in the future 
summary cash flow information years ended december  change in millions cash flows from operating activities continuing operations before contributions to us pension plan contributions to primary us pension plan subtotal discontinued operations operating activities cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures acquisitions cash held by bhs at the spin off date other discontinued operations investing activities cash flows before financing activities operating activities operating cash flows decreased by million in as cash flows from both our continuing and discontinued operations were lower compared to the decrease in operating cash flows from continuing operations was mainly due to the third quarter contribution to our primary us pension plan  of which million was made in cash 
while not affecting our cash flow  we also contributed million in brink s stock to our pension  for a total contribution of million to the plan 
the pension contribution cash outflow was partially offset by million in income tax refunds  much of which were primarily the result of tax deductions associated with the cash and stock contribution to the pension plan 
lower operating profit in also had a negative effect on cash flows from operations although we used less cash for working capital needs 
the decrease in operating cash flows related to discontinued operations was primarily due to bhs cash flows in exceeding fblet cash refunds  the primary source of operating cash flows from discontinued operations in our operating cash flows decreased by million in compared to  primarily as a result of million less cash provided by our discontinued bhs operation  which only had ten months of operations in  as well as expenses for professional and legal fees to spin off the operation 
in addition  our continuing operations before voluntary contributions to our us pension plan provided million less cash from operations than the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to higher professional  legal and advisory fees for shareholder initiatives  and higher cash usage for working capital needs  partially offset by higher segment operating profit 
we voluntarily contributed million to our primary us pension plan in investing activities cash flows from investing activities used million less cash in versus primarily due to the spin off of bhs in bhs used million in primarily for the installation of home security equipment for customers  and we contributed million to bhs at the date of the spin off 
our continuing operations used more cash for investing activities in compared to for business acquisitions and higher capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired operations in brazil million and india million during proceeds from the disposition of assets in included the sale of certain coal assets for million  and the total proceeds in were approximately the same as cash flows for acquisitions in were also approximately the same as capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization are as follows outlook years ended december  change in millions capital expenditures international north america capital expenditures depreciation and amortization international north america depreciation and amortization not provided 
capital expenditures in were slightly higher than the same period of capital expenditures in were primarily for new cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles  and information technology 
higher capital expenditures in our north america segment were partially offset by a decrease in our international segment 
the increase in our north america segment was mainly due to higher expenditures for armored vehicles  as we elected to buy rather than lease these vehicles  as well as increased spending on compusafe units 
the decrease in brink s international capital expenditures from the prior year period was due to lower spending overall  as well as the impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
we had million higher capital expenditures in versus primarily for new facilities  cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles  and information technology 
capital expenditures have exceeded depreciation and amortization in the last several years and this trend is expected to continue in the next several years as a result of growth in the infrastructure of our operations  including new branch facilities and leasehold improvements  growth in compusafe assets  technology investments  and investment in the safety and security of our operations

capitalization we use a combination of debt  leases and equity to capitalize our operations 
as described on page  we made a voluntary contribution of million to our primary us pension plan in the third quarter of  which included  shares of brink s common stock  which was valued at million at the date of the contribution 
as of december   debt as a percentage of capitalization defined as total debt and shareholders equity was compared to at december  the decrease resulted from a higher level of shareholders equity which more than offset the increase in debt of million 
equity increased in primarily as a result of other comprehensive income associated with the increased value of assets held by retirement plans  the contribution of brink s common stock to the us pension plan as well as the generation of million in income from continuing operations

net debt cash is equal to short term debt plus the current and noncurrent portion of long term debt debt in the tables  less cash and cash equivalents 
net debt cash is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
we use net debt cash as a measure of our financial leverage 
we believe that investors also may find net debt cash to be helpful in evaluating our financial leverage 
net debt cash should not be considered as an alternative to debt determined in accordance with gaap and should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
set forth above is a reconciliation of net debt cash  a non gaap financial measure  to debt  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap  as of december   and december  net debt cash position changed primarily due to the decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance 
items that affected cash and cash equivalents during were after tax us pension plan contribution million acquisitions net of cash acquired million venezuela repatriation and translation at less favorable parallel market rate million other net inflows  including fblet refund  additional us tax refunds and cash from operations  less foreign tax payments debt we have an unsecured million revolving bank credit facility the revolving facility with a syndicate of banks 
the revolving facility s interest rate is based on libor plus a margin  prime rate  or competitive bid 
the revolving facility allows us to borrow or otherwise satisfy credit needs on a revolving basis over a five year term ending in august as of december   million was available under the revolving facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december   were denominated primarily in us dollars and to a lesser extent in canadian dollars 
the margin on libor borrowings under the revolving facility which can range from to  depending on our credit rating  was at december  when borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving facility are in excess of million  the applicable interest rate is increased by or 
we also pay an annual facility fee on the revolving facility based on our credit rating 
the facility fee  which can range from to  was at the end of we have an unsecured million letter of credit facility with a bank the letter of credit facility 
the letter of credit facility expires in july as of december   million was available under the letter of credit facility 
the revolving facility and the multi currency revolving credit facilities described below are also used for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
we have two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities with a total of million in available credit  of which approximately million was available at december  interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a margin 
the margin ranges from to 
the two facilities expire in december we also have the ability to borrow from other banks under short term uncommitted agreements 
various foreign subsidiaries maintain other lines of credit and overdraft facilities with a number of banks 
the revolving facility  the letter of credit facility and the two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities contain subsidiary guarantees and various financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants  among other things  limit our total indebtedness  limit asset sales  limit the use of proceeds from asset sales and provide for minimum coverage of interest costs 
the credit agreements do not provide for the acceleration of payments should our credit rating be reduced 
if we were not to comply with the terms of our various loan agreements  the repayment terms could be accelerated and the commitments could be withdrawn 
an acceleration of the repayment terms under one agreement could trigger the acceleration of the repayment terms under the other loan agreements 
we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants at december  we have million of bonds issued by the peninsula ports authority of virginia recorded as debt on our balance sheet 
although we are not the primary obligor of the debt  we have guaranteed the debt and we believe that we will ultimately pay this obligation 
the guarantee originated as part of a former interest in dominion terminal associates  a deep water coal terminal 
we continue to pay interest on the debt 
the bonds bear a fixed interest rate of and mature in the bonds may mature prior to upon the occurrence of specified events such as the determination that the bonds are taxable or if we fail to abide by the terms of the guarantee 
based on our current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit facilities and current projections of cash flows from operations  we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for more than the next months 
equity at december   we had million shares of common stock authorized and million shares issued and outstanding 
share purchases on september   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares 
the repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date 
under the program  we used million to purchase  shares of common stock between december   and may   at an average price of per share 
we used an additional million to purchase  shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of  at an average price of per share 
in the first quarter of  we used an additional million to purchase  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
no shares were purchased in the second  third or fourth quarters of as of december   we had million under this program available to purchase shares 
dividends we paid regular quarterly dividends on our common stock during the last three years 
on january   the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of cents per share payable on march  future dividends are dependent on the earnings  financial condition  shareholder equity levels  cash flow and business requirements of the company  as determined by the board of directors 
employee benefits trust in september  we terminated the brink s company employee benefits trust the employee benefits trust 
immediately prior to termination  the shares held by the trust were distributed to us and the shares were retired 
the purpose of the employee benefits trust prior to termination was to hold shares of our common stock to fund obligations under compensation and employee benefit programs that provided for the issuance of stock 
after the termination of the trust  newly issued shares are used to satisfy these programs 
through  shares of common stock were voted by the trustee in the same proportion as the shares of common stock voted by our employees participating in our k plan 
our k plan divested all shares of our common stock in january after the k plan divested all shares of company common stock  shares of the trust were not voted in matters voted on by shareholders 
preferred stock at december   we have the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
we use operating leases to lower our cost of financings 
we believe that operating leases are an important component of our capital structure

on january   there were approximately  beneficiaries in the plans 
in  we contributed million to the primary us pension plan  which helped reduce the underfunded status of us plans to million 
we are not required to make additional contributions until the contractual obligations table above includes the required contributions to comply with the minimum funding requirements of the pension protection act of based on actuarial assumptions at the end of we have elected the asset smoothing basis of computing asset values for funding purposes to reduce the volatility of future required contributions to the plans 
the amount of these required contributions may vary as they are subject to potential changes in asset values  discount rates on future obligations  assumed rates of return  and potential legislative action 
we may elect to make voluntary contributions to achieve certain threshold funding levels 
based on current assumptions  the underfunded status is expected to decline from through and become fully funded under gaap in umwa plans retirement benefits related to former coal operations include medical benefits provided by the pittston coal group companies employee benefit plan for umwa represented employees 
on january   there were approximately  beneficiaries in the umwa plans 
in  we began using the assets of the plans to fund the majority of the benefit payments required under our umwa retirement medical plans 
based on our funding assumptions as of december   we do not expect to make additional contributions to these plans until we and certain current and former subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for approximately million of retirement obligations 
we have funded a significant portion of these obligations in the past 
we have recognized the obligations  net of funded amounts in our financial statements 
we have indemnified bhs and the purchasers of bax global and natural resources assets for their contingent obligation 
black lung and other plans under the federal black lung benefits act of  brink s is also responsible for paying lifetime black lung benefits to miners and their dependents for claims filed after june  the unfunded balance and cash payments related to black lung are expected to decline over time due to mortality 
on december   there were approximately black lung beneficiaries in the plan 
we also have a plan that provides retirement health care benefits to certain eligible salaried employees

actual amounts could differ materially from the estimated amounts 
contingent matters income tax we are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
we have approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits at december  the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits has been measured in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
the amount of tax benefits ultimately recognized for open tax periods at december   will depend on the final outcome of the various issues that may arise during an examination  and the tax benefit recognized may be materially different from that amount as measured under fasb asc topic federal black lung excise tax fblet refunds in late  congress passed the energy improvement and extension act of which enabled taxpayers to file claims for fblet refunds for periods prior to those open under the statute of limitations previously applicable to us 
in the second quarter of  we received fblet refunds and recognized the majority of these refunds as a pretax gain of million 
the gain related to these refunds was recorded in discontinued operations 
former operations bax global  a former business unit  is defending a claim related to the apparent diversion by a third party of goods being transported for a customer 
during  bax global advised us that it is probable that it will be deemed liable for this claim 
we have contractually indemnified the purchaser of bax global for this contingency 
although it is possible that this claim ultimately may be decided in favor of bax global  we have accrued million million at december  related to this matter 
we recognized the expense in discontinued operations 
we believe we have insurance coverage applicable to this matter and that it will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
other we are involved in various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to estimate the range of losses for some of these matters 
we have recorded accruals for losses that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
we make assumptions  estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
reported results could have been materially different had management used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
accounting policies we establish valuation allowances in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  when we estimate it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
we decide to record valuation allowances primarily based on an assessment of historical earnings and future taxable income that incorporates prudent  feasible tax planning strategies 
we assess deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
changes in tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance could result in material adjustments to our valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense 
our valuation allowances are as follows valuation allowances december  in millions us non us total application of accounting policies us deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets before valuation allowances increased significantly in primarily as a result of higher us retirement obligations 
at the end of  we expected that future taxable income of our us operations would not have been sufficient to realize the entire benefit from the future tax deductions associated with these obligations 
we therefore concluded that approximately million of us federal and state net deferred tax assets would not have been realized and provided a valuation allowance for these assets in other comprehensive income loss 
our deferred tax assets  before valuation allowances  decreased in as a result of an increase in retirement asset values from the equity market improvement and our contribution to the primary us pension plan 
the likelihood of realizing additional amounts of the remaining deferred tax assets improved due to improving market conditions  including credit markets 
as a result  we revised our estimate of the amount of us valuation allowances needed and reversed million in income from continuing operations 
we used various estimates and assumptions to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in the us these included projected revenues and operating income for our us entities  estimated required contributions to our us retirement plans  and interest rates on projected us borrowings 
had we used different assumptions  we might have made different conclusions about the need for valuation allowances 
for example  in we might have concluded that we should not reverse any of the valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax asset  or we might have concluded that we should have reversed less than we did 
further  using different assumptions in we might have concluded that we did not require a valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax assets at the end of in either of these cases  our tax provision on income from continuing operations could have been up to million higher in non us deferred tax assets we changed our judgment about the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain non us jurisdictions as a result of improvements in operating results and an improved outlook about the future operating performance 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowances in and million of valuation allowances in through continuing operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   we had property and equipment of million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we review these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  for goodwill and other intangible assets and fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment  for property and equipment 
our review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of our operating subsidiaries 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimates of the fair value of these assets  differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the impairment analyses 
application of accounting policies goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if impairment is indicated 
due to a history of profitability and cash flow generation along with expectations for future cash flows  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 
other intangible assets and property and equipment we review long lived assets besides goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether impairment has occurred  we compare estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value 
we recognized a million impairment charge in prior to selling a portion of our united kingdom operation 
we have had no other significant impairments of property and equipment in the last three years 
retirement and postemployment benefit obligations we provide benefits through defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements eg  black lung and workers compensation obligations 
accounting policy we account for retirement and postemployment benefit obligations under fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits and fasb asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
the primary benefits are accounted for as follows pension obligations fasb asc topic other retiree obligations fasb asc topic workers compensation obligations fasb asc topic to account for these benefits  we make assumptions of expected return on assets  discount rates  inflation  demographic factors and changes in the laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on our liabilities and expenses related to these benefits 
our most significant retirement plans include our primary us pension plan and the retiree medical plans of our former coal business that were collectively bargained with the united mine workers of america the umwa 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
application of accounting policy discount rate assumptions for plans accounted under fasb asc topic for plans accounted under fasb asc topic  we discount estimated future payments using discount rates based on market conditions at the end of the year 
in general  our liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates 
that is  the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
the discount rate used to measure the present value of our benefit obligations was derived using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  we compare the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with similar expected payment streams 
each year s projected cash flows are then discounted back to their present value at the measurement date and an overall discount rate is determined 
we changed our method of estimating our discount rate for our us plans in in  an average of the discount rates calculated using mercer yield curve and the citigroup pension discount curve was selected and was rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
in  we simplified our method to use only the mercer yield curve  rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
the discount rate in determined using our new method would not have changed if we had used our prior method 
the discount rates for the us pension plans  umwa retiree medical plans and black lung obligations were primary us plan umwa plans black lung discount rate retirement cost benefit obligation at year end sensitivity analysis the discount rate we select at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations for our largest plans as of december   actual expenses for and projected expenses for assuming we had used discount rates that were one percentage point lower or higher 
plan obligations at december  hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions primary us pension plan umwa plans actual and projected expense income in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  primary us pension plan discount rate assumption retirement cost credit umwa plans discount rate assumption retirement cost expected return on assets assumption for plans accounted under fasb asc topic our expected return on assets assumption  which affects our net periodic benefit cost  reflects the long term average rate of return we expect the plan assets to earn 
we select the expected return on assets assumption using advice from our investment advisor and actuary considering each plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of the most recent long term historical average compounded rates of return  as applicable 
we selected as the expected return on assets assumption as of december  and over the last ten years  the annual returns of our primary us pension plan have averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  while the year compounded annual return averaged and the year compounded annual return averaged 
sensitivity analysis effect of using different expected rate of return assumptions 
our and projected expense would have been different if we had used different expected rate of return assumptions 
for every hypothetical change of one percentage point in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and holding other assumptions constant  our and expense would be as follows in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset assumption hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  expected return on asset assumption primary us pension plan a umwa plans a expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
effect of improving or deteriorating actual future market returns 
our funded status at december   and our expense will be different from currently projected amounts if our projected returns are better or worse than the return we have assumed 
in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis of asset return better or worse than expected better worse years ending december  projected return return return on investments in funded status at december  primary us pension plan umwa plans expense primary us pension plan a umwa plans a expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
effect of using fair market value of assets to determine expense 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
in addition  our plan asset actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization are based on the market related value 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is  at a point in time  the value of the assets that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value from the expected value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
our expenses related to our primary us pension plan would have been different if our accounting policy were to use the fair market value of plan assets instead of the market related value to recognize investment gains and losses 
in millions based on market related value of assets hypothetical a actual projected projected years ending december  expense income primary us pension plan a assumes that our accounting policy was to use the fair market value of assets instead of the market related value of assets to determine our expense relatedto our primary us pension plan 
for our umwa plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at the beginning of the year 
this method is likely to cause the credit to earnings from the expected return on assets to fluctuate more than the similar credit using the accounting methodology of our defined benefit pension plans 
medical inflation assumption we estimate the trend in health care cost inflation to predict future cash flows related to our retiree medical plans 
our assumption is based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
for the umwa plans  our major postretirement plans  we have assumed a medical inflation rate of for  and we project this rate to decline to by the average annual increase for medical inflation in the plan for the last five years has been below 
if we assumed that medical inflation rates were one percentage point higher in each future year  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been approximately million higher at december   and the expense for would have been million higher 
if we had assumed that the medical inflation rate would be one percentage point lower  the plan obligation would have been approximately million lower at december   and the related expenses would have been million lower 
if we had projected medical inflation rates to ratably decline from to by  instead of ratably declining to by as we estimated  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been million higher for and our expense would be million higher for in addition  health care reform currently under consideration in the us congress could substantially change the health care and insurance industries in the united states  which could increase our costs 
workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
our liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of an actuary 
numbers of participants the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  we rely on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
we use the following mortality table for our major plans 
plan mortality table umwa plans rp employee  annuitant healthy blue collar black lung rp blue collar primary us pension rp combined healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan in the past five years is as follows number of participants plan umwa plans black lung us pension since we are no longer operating in the coal industry  we anticipate that the number of participants in the umwa retirement medical plan and the number of participants receiving benefits under black lung regulations will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants should also decline over time 
foreign currency translation the majority of our subsidiaries outside the us conduct business in their local currencies 
our financials report results in us dollars  which include the results of these subsidiaries 
accounting policy our accounting policy for foreign currency translation is different depending on whether the economy in which our foreign subsidiary operates has been designated as highly inflationary or not 
economies with a three year cumulative inflation rate of more than are considered as highly inflationary 
at the end of  we did not have any subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
non highly inflationary economies assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in non highly inflationary economies are translated into us dollars using rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in effect during the year 
transaction gains and losses are recorded in net income 
highly inflationary economies foreign subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary countries must use the reporting currency the us dollar as the functional currency 
local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into dollars each balance sheet date  with remeasurement adjustments and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 
non monetary assets and liabilities do not fluctuate with changes in local currency exchange rates to the dollar 
application of accounting policy use of parallel market exchange rate to convert venezuelan operations our venezuelan operations  which are owned by brink s  constitute a material portion of our overall consolidated operations 
there are two currency exchange rates which may be used to convert venezuelan bolivar fuertes into other currencies an official rate and a market rate 
the use of the official rate to convert cash held in bolivar fuertes into other currencies requires the approval of the venezuelan government s currency control organization 
the parallel market rate may be used to obtain us dollars without the approval of the currency control organization 
in december  we repatriated dividends generated by our venezuelan operations that had been unpaid over the last several years using the parallel market exchange rate 
we decided to repatriate our dividends using the parallel rate due to significant delays in receiving the needed government approval to repatriate dividends at the official rate 
we began translating our financial statements for our venezuelan operations using the parallel rate  effective december   the date of our decision  since we expect to pay future dividends using the parallel rate 
this is consistent with the guidance issued by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality the iptf and us gaap 
this guidance provides that  in the absence of unusual circumstances  the rate used for dividend remittances should be used to translate foreign financial statements 
we recognized foreign currency translation losses because we changed to the parallel rate for purposes of translating our venezuelan financial position 
we recognized losses in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss in of million attributable to brink s million attributable to noncontrolling interests  and million in total 
we have provided a non gaap adjusted earnings measure within our management s discussion and analysis that provides supplemental analysis to assist readers understand the hypothetical effect on our financial results had we used the parallel rate to report our results in the past

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate in more than countries 
these operations expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
we periodically use various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge our interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
we do not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance our operations 
floating rate obligations  including our revolving facility  expose us to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including our dominion terminal associates debt  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  our weighted average interest rate on our floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair value of our dominion terminal associates debt for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase in the fair value of this debt 
foreign currency risk we have exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of its foreign operations 
our foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
we are exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  we  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no material foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which we have continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease effect on earnings translation of earnings into us dollars transaction gains losses effect on other comprehensive income loss translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated impact of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar 
the foreign currency exposure impact related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different
