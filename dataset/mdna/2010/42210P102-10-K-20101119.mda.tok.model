item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we currently operate in three industries light building products  heavy construction materials and energy technology 
in the light building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell manufactured architectural stone  exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
revenues in the heavy construction materials segment consist primarily of ccp product sales along with a smaller amount from services 
we are the nationwide leader in the management and marketing of ccps  including fly ash used as a replacement for portland cement 
in the energy technology segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
revenues for the energy technology segment consist primarily of coal sales  equity earnings in joint ventures and catalyst sales 
operations and strategy 
during the past several years  we have executed our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying away from our historical reliance on the legacy energy technology section k business 
our past acquisition strategy targeted businesses that were leading companies in their respective industries and that had strong operating margins  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of our existing businesses 
with the addition and expansion of our ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions beginning in  and the growth of our light building products business through several acquisitions beginning in  we have achieved revenue growth and diversification in three business segments 
in and subsequent years  we focused on the integration of our large acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse kinds of building products through our national distribution network 
in  we began to acquire small companies in the light building products industry with innovative products that could be marketed using the extensive distribution channels we have developed over many years 
during and  our primary focus was on the development of our coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment and our use of cash consisted primarily of growth capital expenditures  a major portion of which related to coal cleaning facilities 
in late and in and  as the economy deteriorated  we focused on operational efficiency improvements and cost reductions in order to strengthen our balance sheet 
we engaged in significant cost savings efforts in our light building products segment by reducing advertising  employee  transportation and other expenses 
our continuous improvement initiatives within our heavy construction materials segment focused on reducing our cost structure through process improvements  headcount reductions  lower maintenance spending and improved terms on operating leases 
we consolidated our coal cleaning business under our heavy construction materials management to reduce overhead 
we also significantly reduced corporate and research and development spending 
in  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of our outstanding convertible 
table of contents senior subordinated notes 
we also entered into a million asset based revolving loan facility abl revolver  which is currently undrawn  and retired high interest convertible debt and increased our cash balance with proceeds from the sale of our interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture and a federal income tax refund 
light building products segment 
the key strategic element of our building products strategy is to introduce new products into our extensive distribution system  providing us a means to rapidly increase geographic coverage for new products 
our light building products segment has been significantly affected by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
accordingly  we have significantly reduced operating costs to be positively positioned to take advantage of a sustained industry turnaround when it occurs 
we continue to develop new building products and to leverage our robust distribution system which we believe is a competitive advantage for us 
there has been a severe slowing in the years through of new housing starts and in home sales generally 
bank foreclosures have put a large number of homes into the market for sale  effectively limiting some of the incentives to build new homes 
the homebuilding industry continues to experience a decline in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale 
because our light building products business relies on the home improvement and remodeling markets as well as new construction  we experienced a further slowdown in sales activity but believe some stabilization has occurred during the latter part of with small increases in our year over year comparables 
limits on credit availability  further home foreclosures  home price depreciation  and an oversupply of homes for sale in the market may adversely affect homeowners and or homebuilders ability or desire to engage in construction or remodeling  resulting in an extended period of low new construction starts and slow increases in remodeling and repair activities 
we  like many others in the light building products industry  experienced a large drop in orders and a reduction in our margins in and relative to prior years 
in  and  we recorded significant goodwill impairments associated with our light building products business 
none of the impairment charges in these years affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or debt covenant compliance 
weakness continued into and it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable 
we can provide no assurances that the light building products market will improve in the near future 
the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the going concern threats to banks and other financial institutions resulted in a tightening of the credit markets and a low level of liquidity in many financial markets 
while mortgage and home equity loan rates have decreased  volatility continues to exist in credit and equity markets  increased borrowing requirements prevent many potential buyers from qualifying for home mortgages and equity loans and there exists a continued lack of consumer confidence 
continued tightness of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements could adversely affect the availability of credit for purchasers of our products and thereby reduce our sales 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including the inability of prospective homebuyers or remodelers to obtain credit for financing the purchase of our building products 
these and other similar factors could cause decisions to delay or forego new home construction or improvement projects  cause our customers to delay or decide not to purchase our building products  or lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance 
heavy construction materials segment 
our business strategy in the heavy construction materials industry is to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers  supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
we are also continuing our efforts to expand the use of high value ccps  develop more uses for lower value ccps  and expand our ccp disposal services 
while all of our businesses have been affected by the current recession  the impact on our heavy construction materials segment has been somewhat less severe than on our other segments 
we anticipate that if the federal government expands the funding of roads  bridges  and other infrastructure projects as a part of economic stimulus programs  demand for ccps could improve 
finally  a key element of our strategy is to increase our site service revenue generated from ccp management 

table of contents energy technology segment 
we own and operate newly constructed and recently renovated coal cleaning facilities that remove impurities from waste coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
construction of these facilities was our largest single investment of cash during and  but is now complete 
capital expenditures in and were financed primarily with available cash from operations and lease financing 
capital expenditures in were significantly lower than prior years and this trend will continue into the future 
for  coal sales were million  compared to million for the decrease in is partially due to the decline in demand and pricing for coal 
as of september   we have temporarily curtailed operations at two of our coal cleaning facilities and reduced staffing at other facilities to better match coal production with current demand 
as of september   the coal cleaning facilities were operating at less than of projected capacity 
we continue to invest in research and development activities focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology  but at decreased levels compared to earlier years 
we participate in a joint venture that operates an ethanol plant located in north dakota 
we also participated in a joint venture that owns a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea but we sold our interest in that joint venture during we are also investing in other energy projects such as the refining of heavy crude oils into lighter transportation fuels  and in october we announced a successful multi week plant trial of our hcat catalyst 
seasonality and weather 
both our light building products and our heavy construction materials segments are greatly impacted by seasonality 
revenues  profitability and ebitda are generally highest in the june and september quarters 
further  both segments are affected by weather to the extent it impacts construction activities 
debt and liquidity 
we incurred indebtedness in prior years to make strategic acquisitions  but were also able to increase cash flows and utilize that cash to reduce debt levels 
we became highly leveraged as a result of acquisitions  but reduced our outstanding debt significantly through by using cash generated from operations  from underwritten public offerings of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
during through  we made several early repayments of our long term debt 
in and  early repayments of long term debt decreased as compared to earlier years primarily due to our investments of available cash in the development of our coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment 
during  we repaid approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes leaving a balance of approximately million 
we now have no debt maturities prior to  unless the holders of the remaining convertible senior subordinated notes exercise their put option in cash needs for capital expenditures were significantly lower in than in which allowed us to focus on liquidity and enabled us to continue implementing our overall operational strategy and the early repayment of debt 
we currently have approximately million of cash on hand and additional cash flow is expected to be generated from operations over the next months 
in summary  our strategy for and subsequent years is to continue capital expenditures at reduced levels  continue activities to improve operations and reduce operating and general overhead costs  and to reduce our outstanding debt levels using cash on hand and cash flow from operations to the extent possible 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

table of contents we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefit  over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the acquisition date fair value of identified assets  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
asc topic requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if indicators of possible impairment arise 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of june  using the two step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment arise 
we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of all long lived assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the estimated useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
no significant changes have been made to estimated useful lives during the periods presented 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill is tested primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
the carrying value of a long lived asset other than goodwill is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a history of operating or cash flow losses  a decline in operating performance  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
material goodwill impairments were recorded in and and a material impairment of property plant and equipment was recorded in in connection with the goodwill impairment testing for the light building products and energy technology reporting units in  we also performed an analysis for potential impairments of other long lived assets in those reporting units  including all intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
the results of that analysis did not result in any significant impairment of any other long lived assets 
it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that any resulting write downs could be material 
property  plant and equipment as disclosed in note  in  we recorded an asset impairment in our energy technology segment 
many of our coal cleaning assets were idled or have produced coal at low levels of capacity over the last two years  primarily because of market conditions  and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
using assumptions in a forecast of future cash flows that were based primarily on historical operating conditions  we determined that a coal cleaning asset impairment existed at september  and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 

table of contents there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of our coal cleaning assets  including future production levels  future coal prices  whether cleaned coal will be sold in the steam or metallurgical markets  the extent to which section tax credits will be earned and utilized in future periods  future operating margins  required capital expenditures  the extent  quality and productive lives of feedstock coal refuse reserves  and the potential relocation of facilities to more favorable sites or selling certain facilities  among other considerations 
we have coal cleaning facilities  two of which are managed and operated as a single unit 
asc topic property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that an analysis for potential impairment be performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
for us  this means different asset groups were required to be analyzed  each of which has many unique operating and contractual features associated with it 
asc topic also indicates that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset group are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows associated with the likely course of action  the likelihood of those possible outcomes shall be considered 
accordingly  for most operations a probability weighted approach was used in considering the likelihood of different potential outcomes 
while the coal cleaning business in its entirety has operated at a loss since inception several years ago  in  it was near breakeven from a cash flow perspective  with somewhat better results in the last half of the year than in the first half of the year 
however  as noted above  some facilities were idled or have produced coal at low levels and have negative cash flows 
we determined that impairments existed in five of the ten coal cleaning operations 
following the impairment  the coal cleaning operations carrying value of property  plant and equipment was approximately million 
for the five operations for which we determined no impairment existed  estimated future cash flows exceeded carrying value by approximately million in the aggregate 
for most operations  recent historical experience was the prevalent assumption driving the cash flow models 
for some of the operations  an eventual relocation of the facilities was considered a potential outcome  and for one operation  the sale of the facility was considered a potential outcome 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of the inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is certain that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences will likely be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would necessarily result in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
we will reassess our cash flow input estimates and assumptions  including probabilities related thereto  if triggering events arise in the future 
if assumptions regarding future cash flows related to the coal cleaning assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
goodwill as a result of the depressed new housing and residential repair and remodeling markets  we determined that the light building products reporting unit goodwill was impaired as of the june test date in  and a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in that year 
due to the continuing decline in the new housing and residential repair and remodeling markets  the continued downward revisions by market analysts of near term projections in these markets  the collapse of the credit markets in and the significant decline in our stock price during the six months ended march   management determined that indicators of further goodwill impairment in the light building products reporting unit existed 
in addition  the significant declines in coal and oil prices and in our stock price indicated potential goodwill impairment in the energy technology reporting unit as well 
accordingly  we performed goodwill impairment tests for both the light building products and energy technology reporting units during the quarter ended march  upon completion of the impairment tests  we wrote off all remaining goodwill in the light building products and energy technology reporting units  totaling approximately million 
none of the impairment charges in or affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or senior debt covenant compliance 
changes in the credit markets in late and in increased our borrowing rate  which borrowing rate directly affected the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment calculations 
this increase in the discount rate led to the majority of the goodwill impairment in 
table of contents the heavy construction materials reporting unit had recorded goodwill of approximately million as of september  and the goodwill impairment test indicated no impairment for the heavy construction materials reporting unit for any test date  and accordingly  no impairment charges have been necessary for any period 
the estimated fair value of the heavy construction materials reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the june  test date by approximately million 
the anticipated future cash flows for this reporting unit are not currently expected to change significantly from levels 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  all three of the traditional valuation approaches  the income approach  the market approach and the asset based approach  were considered 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using the income approach  determined by discounting expected future cash flows 
this method was chosen because it specifically considers the operations  opportunities and risks applicable to the reporting units 
the market approach  specifically the guideline public company method  was also considered 
however  the reporting units direct competitors are either subsets of large corporate entities or are privately held 
therefore  there is limited comparability between the reporting units and the potential guideline public companies 
accordingly  the guideline public company method was utilized only as a reasonableness test of the results from the income approach 
finally  the asset based approach was also considered  however  it was not utilized because it does not consider the income producing going concern nature of the reporting units assets 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units are calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing these expected future cash flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management uses its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is certain that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
the most sensitive assumptions for the income approach were the discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital  the expected long term growth rate and expected future gross profit margins 
for the light building products reporting unit  discount rates of and were used in and  respectively 
each change in the discount rate would have changed the fair value of the reporting unit by approximately million in and million in the long term growth rate used was in both and each change in the long term growth rate would have changed the fair value by approximately million in and million in the expected future gross profit margins used ranged from in and in each change in the gross profit margins would have changed the fair value by approximately million in and million in the sensitivity to a change in these assumptions was much less pronounced in because of the high discount rate used  thereby lessening the impact of other variables on the fair value calculation 
our light building products segment gross margin percentage for the years through was   and  respectively 
the year over year revenue growth decrease was   and over the same period 
the results for reflect the recent dramatic slowing of the light building products industry  however  we did not believe that those conditions were indicative of the long term future of the housing market 
the housing market is extremely cyclical and the cycles can vary materially in length and scope 
average housing starts reported by the us national association of home builders nahb for the previous seventeen years  including calendar  were million units per year 
while the estimated housing starts for calendar were million  the five year average that included then current estimates for calendar and indicated estimated average housing starts of more than million units  which was nearly higher than the calendar actual starts 
we believe that the gross profit margins used in the cash flow forecast of in and in  which were consistent with our actual levels  were reasonable in the 
table of contents long term  especially given productivity improvements being implemented through application of lean manufacturing techniques 
we also believe that the long term revenue growth rate of was likely to be achieved when the housing market rebounded 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments are routinely required in the calculation of our income tax provisions 
for example  the irs is currently auditing section k tax credits claimed for synthetic fuel sold from alternative fuel facilities we owned and operated through december  the tax credits which are under audit that we believe are more likely than not to be sustained  and are therefore not included in unrecognized income tax benefits in the balance sheet  total approximately million 
in the years presented  section refined coal tax credits which are different from the section k tax credits discussed above and elsewhere have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the irs will challenge section tax credits claimed by us 
there are multiple bases upon which the irs may challenge the tax credits  including whether our facilities were placed in service for the purpose of producing refined coal  whether the facilities use waste coal as a feedstock  and whether the testing methods and certifications adequately demonstrate the required emissions reductions 
in addition  congress may modify or repeal section so that these tax credits may not be available in the future 
through september   we have recognized a total income tax benefit of approximately million related to section tax credits 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
most of the impairment charges were not tax deductible 
therefore  the goodwill impairment charges had a significant negative effect on our income tax provision for those years 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted the new rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions in asc topic income taxes effective as of october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
we made a cumulative adjustment to decrease retained earnings and increase income tax liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits by approximately million 
as of september   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits 
approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if released into income 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
for example  we are currently under audit by the irs for the years through and have open tax periods subject to examination by both federal and state taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer required to be recorded in the financial statements 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
these changes could be the result of ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made  beyond amounts currently accrued 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are 
table of contents responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
we have utilized our and prior nols by carrying these amounts back to prior years  receiving income tax refunds 
the nols and tax credit carryforwards are offset by existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  accordingly  in  during which we currently expect to realize a loss before income taxes  there will be a full valuation allowance recorded on the related net deferred tax assets and our effective income tax rate could be near for the year 
litigation 
we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
we incurred approximately million  million and million of expense for legal matters in  and  respectively  which consisted primarily of costs for outside legal counsel 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit increased  from million in to million in our operating loss decreased from million in to million in  and the net loss decreased from million or a diluted loss per share of in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in excluding the goodwill impairment of approximately million in and the asset impairments totaling approximately million in  the operating loss changed from million in to operating income of million in  and the net loss decreased from million or a diluted loss per share of in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a 
table of contents corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in was due primarily to lower sales from our regional block category  and to a lesser extent  the continuing effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets which impacted sales across many of our product lines 
our light building products business appears to have stabilized during the latter part of and we began to experience growth in several product categories within certain geographic areas 
revenues from our siding accessories and architectural stone product categories increased by in the last half of as compared to the last half of over the last two years we have improved overall manufacturing productivity significantly and the gross margin percentage increased from to due primarily to our cost reduction efforts initiated in fiscal we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements and cost reductions have tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in new residential construction  however  the recession has resulted in high unemployment  adding to the high level of home foreclosures  putting additional homes on the market and further reducing the demand for new construction 
new housing starts according to the national association of home builders were million and million units in calendar and  respectively  compared to and year averages of million units for both periods 
our light building products business relies on the home improvement and remodeling markets as well as new construction 
the us census bureau s value of private residential construction spending put in place data on homeowner improvement activity shows that the four quarter moving average peaked at billion in the second quarter of calendar  fell to million in the fourth quarter of calendar  and then rose to billion in the second quarter of calendar the leading indicator of remodeling activity estimate issued by the joint center for housing studies at harvard university has estimated that the four quarter moving average will be billion in the second quarter of calendar  which would be the highest level since the fourth quarter of calendar given our market leadership positions and reduced cost structure  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from a rebound in the housing market when it occurs 
we believe the long term growth prospects in the industry are strong because the current seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts are still well below the and year averages of million units 
according to the harvard joint center for housing studies  the nation s housing stock will have to accommodate approximately million to million additional households due to population growth over the next decade  or approximately million to million households per year 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to a reduction in concrete consumption in the western us  particularly california and nevada  largely offset by increased revenue from site service contracts in the central and eastern regions of the us the reduction in concrete consumption resulted primarily from declines in commercial construction and state infrastructure spending 
the gross margin percentage decreased from to primarily because of product mix  a higher percentage of service revenue compared to product sales and fewer fixed costs being absorbed as a result of lower total sales 
in june  the epa proposed two alternative rules to regulate ccps generated by electric utilities and independent power producers 
one proposed option would classify ccps disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills as special wastes subject to federal hazardous waste regulation under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the second proposed option would instead regulate ccps as non hazardous waste under subtitle d of rcra  with states retaining the lead authority on regulating their handling  storage and disposal 
under both options  the current exemption from hazardous waste regulation for ccps that are recycled for beneficial uses would remain in effect 
however  the epa has requested comments on refining the definition of beneficial uses subject to the exemption  which could result in a narrowing of the scope of exempt uses in the final rule 
both rule options are controversial and the epa has extended the deadline for public comments to november  a final rule may be issued in at this time  it is not possible to 
table of contents predict what form the final regulations will take 
either option is likely to increase the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of ccps 
if the epa decides to regulate ccps as hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c  ccps would become subject to a variety of regulations 
regulation of ccps as hazardous waste would likely have an adverse effect on beneficial use and sales of ccps and our relationships with utilities 
there can be no guarantee that such regulations would not reduce or eliminate our supply or our ability to market fly ash and other ccps which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition 
energy technology segment 
energy technology revenues consisted primarily of coal sales related to our coal cleaning business 
revenues also include equity earnings from our joint venture investments in an ethanol plant located in north dakota and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea which was sold in late and catalyst sales 
segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit loss of million 
cost of revenue related to our coal cleaning business significantly exceeded revenue in both years due primarily to low coal prices and ongoing start up and ramp up costs for newly constructed and renovated coal cleaning facilities that were placed in service in late and in the quarter ended december  equity earnings in our joint ventures were million in compared to million in as of september   we have temporarily idled two of our coal cleaning facilities to align production to sales and to concentrate production in fewer facilities 
we have also reduced staffing at other facilities and cut costs at all locations to reduce the breakeven point for the coal cleaning business 
however  to be successful  we must overcome operational issues  including securing and maintaining strategic relationships with coal companies  landowners  and others that host our coal cleaning facilities  securing adequate coal feedstock at a reasonable price  efficiently handling and transporting materials  and efficiently operating our dredging  slurry piping and coal cleaning equipment 
in the future  we will likely need to undertake the significant disruption and expense of relocating facilities and entering into new strategic relationships where feedstock is exhausted or other critical arrangements come to an end 
we have not achieved our planned economies of scale based on budgeted full production  and to date  our coal cleaning facilities have not consistently operated at a cost that is less than the revenues generated 
profitability depends on our ability to increase production and sales of cleaned coal 
if these facilities operate at low production levels or cannot produce fuel at a cost and quality satisfactory to customers  these operations may not become profitable and some of the facilities could be further impaired  potentially requiring a charge to earnings in the period of impairment 
operating expenses 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets in along with intangible assets that became fully amortized in research and development expense decreased by million from to  primarily because of lower spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies beginning in january selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due to reduced spending in most categories of expense  with the exception of incentive pay and marketing expenses for cleaned coal 
with regard to the million goodwill impairment in and the million impairment of property  plant and equipment in  reference is made to the discussion in critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
in addition  in we also recorded an approximate million impairment charge for assets related to a ccp loading facility that will not be utilized for future fly ash shipments 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the increase in net other expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in net other income of approximately million 

table of contents net interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to i significantly higher interest expense related to million of new senior secured notes issued in early  compared to a lower average balance of former lower interest rate senior secured debt that was outstanding during  and ii approximately million of premium associated with the early repayment of million of our convertible debt in the increase in net other income of million was primarily the result of a million gain on the sale of our equity interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture in  a net loss in of approximately million from convertible debt extinguishment and conversion transactions  and approximately million more gain on sale of property  plant and equipment in than in income tax provision 
the recorded income tax benefit rates for and were and  respectively 
exclusive of the goodwill impairment in  most of which was not tax deductible  the effective rate would have been approximately for that year 
the effective tax benefit rates  disregarding goodwill impairment in  differ from the statutory rate primarily due to section tax credits 
section refined coal tax credits which are different from the section k tax credits discussed elsewhere have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of section tax credits in  our estimated effective tax benefit rate would be approximately  which is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to the effect of valuation allowances and permanent differences 
we have utilized our and prior nols by carrying these amounts back to prior years  receiving income tax refunds 
the nols and tax credit carryforwards are offset by our existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  accordingly  in  during which we currently expect to realize a loss before income taxes  there will be a full valuation allowance recorded on net deferred tax assets and our effective income tax rate could be near for the year 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in our operating loss increased from million in to million in  and the net loss increased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the most significant reason for the change in results from to was an increase in the goodwill impairment charge to million in  compared to million in in addition to the goodwill impairment charges in both years  our section k business terminated in excluding our section k business for  total revenue for was down  from million for  and gross profit was down  from million in excluding our section k business and the goodwill impairment charges for both and  operating income decreased from million in to an operating loss of million in revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in 
table of contents was due primarily to the continuing effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets which impacted sales across most of our product lines 
also  in early  we sold certain non strategic mortar stucco assets in this segment which accounted for approximately million of the decrease in revenue from to the gross margin percentage declined from to due primarily to fewer fixed costs being absorbed as a result of lower sales 
we believe our niche strategy and our focus in on productivity improvements and cost reductions tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in new residential construction  however  the recession resulted in higher unemployment  adding to the high level of home foreclosures  putting additional homes on the market and further reducing the demand for new construction 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to significant reductions in concrete consumption  partially offset by increased revenue from service contracts 
the gross margin percentage increased from to primarily due to declines in the costs of rail and truck transportation and improved productivity 
energy technology segment 
in  our energy technology segment revenue consisted primarily of residual revenues related to our section k business 
in  there was no section k revenue and energy technology segment revenue consisted almost exclusively of coal sales related to our coal cleaning business 
cost of revenue exceeded revenue for this segment in due primarily to low coal prices and ongoing start up and ramp up costs for newly constructed and renovated coal cleaning facilities that were placed in service in late and in the quarter ended december  operating expenses 
the increase in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in a late acquisition 
research and development expense decreased by million from to  primarily because of decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due to reduced expenses in every significant category of expense except for professional services 
the largest contributor of cost savings was personnel related costs  including incentive pay  totaling million 
incentive pay decreased due to reduced profitability of our operations  and other personnel related costs decreased primarily because of headcount reductions 
professional services increased by approximately million in due to significant litigation costs  which increased million from other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million during the change in other income and expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million  combined with a change in net other income expense of approximately million 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in due to several factors  most notably increased interest expense attributed to our convertible debt exchanges that occurred in that resulted in the extinguishment of million of and convertible notes and the issuance of million of and convertible notes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these convertible debt exchanges  approximately million of accelerated debt issue costs were amortized related to the extinguished convertible notes 
in addition  we experienced higher interest rates on our senior debt as a result of two amendments to our former senior secured credit agreement and increased interest expense from higher utilization of our revolving credit facility in the change in net other income expense of million consisted primarily of a million loss in related to the exchanges of convertible debt for both new convertible debt gain of million and common stock loss of million  plus a decrease of million in gain on sale of property  plant and equipment in 
table of contents as compared to in  we sold certain non strategic mortar stucco assets in the light building products segment on which a gain of approximately million was recognized 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to acquire assets that increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business  which contributed to higher operating income of this business in income tax provision 
we recorded income taxes with an effective income tax benefit rate of in approximately exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible and approximately in approximately exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible 
the effective tax rates disregarding goodwill impairment differ from the statutory rate primarily due to section tax credits 
impact of inflation and related matters in certain periods  some of our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities  such as polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride in the light building products segment  however  the negative impact has generally been less significant during than during prior years 
we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  increased materials costs to customers 
additionally  decreases in fuel costs benefited all of our business units 
it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on any future price increases to customers 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in the net loss in was significantly less than the net loss in  however  the net loss  after adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge and the change in deferred income taxes most of which related to the goodwill impairment  was approximately million  while the net loss  after adjusting for the asset impairments and the change in deferred income taxes most of which related to the asset impairments  was approximately million 
also  there was a significant difference between years in the non cash results of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in  there were net gains from equity method investments of approximately million  compared to a net gain of approximately million in we have not experienced any significant changes in our historical patterns of receivable collections or in trade account delinquencies in in both and  our primary investing activity consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
in  we made an approximate million deferred payment for a fiscal year acquisition  and in  we received approximately million from the sale of our interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture and other cash payments from another unconsolidated joint venture 
in  our financing activities consisted primarily of borrowings under our revolving credit arrangement and several non cash convertible debt exchanges for both new convertible debt and common stock  and the issuance of common stock  the net proceeds of which were used to repay long term debt 
in  we consummated a significant restructuring of our long term debt  resulting in the issuance of new senior secured notes and the repayment of all of our former senior secured debt and a portion of our convertible debt 
we also repaid million of convertible debt in more details about these and other investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
total expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  a decrease of million from in  the majority of capital expenditures were for projects in the energy technology segment  primarily the construction and renovation of coal cleaning facilities 
in  the majority of capital expenditures related to the maintenance of operating capacity in our light building products segment 
total capital expenditures are currently expected to be near the level 

table of contents capital expenditures are limited by the terms of our abl revolver to million in and million in as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
in and  we realized million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  most of which represented non strategic assets in our light building products segment 
in and  we made net payments of approximately and million  respectively  for primarily long term deposits related to our energy segment coal cleaning operations 
in  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held company in the light building products industry 
total consideration for this acquisition was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid at the date of acquisition and approximately million was paid in  with approximately million of assumed liabilities 
in late  we received more than million from the sale of our interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture  recognizing a gain of approximately million 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations and commercialization of technologies currently being developed 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of our long term business strategy  however  primarily because of debt covenant restrictions  but also due to cash flow considerations and recent events affecting the debt and equity markets  we made only one small acquisition in and another small acquisition subsequent to september  we have also invested in joint ventures  one of which was sold in  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
we do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in any of the remaining joint venture entities 
our new debt agreements significantly limit potential acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  with the abl revolver being the most restrictive 
during the four year term of the abl revolver  our acquisitions and investments in joint ventures and other less than owned entities are limited to total cumulative consideration of million 
financing activities 
in  our primary financing activities consisted of i the non cash exchange of million of convertible senior subordinated notes for million of new convertible senior subordinated notes  ii the non cash exchange of approximately million of convertible senior subordinated notes for approximately million shares of common stock  iii the issuance of million shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately million  iv the repayment of long term debt  and v borrowings under our revolving credit arrangement 
in  we exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due for million of new convertible senior subordinated notes due we also exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due for approximately million of new convertible senior subordinated notes due gains of approximately million  recorded in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for  were recognized on the extinguishments of debt 
additionally  approximately million of unamortized debt issue costs related to the extinguished debt was charged to interest expense 
new debt issue costs of approximately million were incurred related to the new and convertible notes 
we also exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes plus related accrued interest for approximately million shares of common stock and we exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes plus accrued interest for approximately million shares of common stock 
in accordance with the provisions of asc topic debt  we recorded a non cash expense of approximately million in connection with these transactions  which amount represented the fair value of the shares issued in excess of the shares required to be issued pursuant to the original terms of conversion 
we issued million shares of common stock for gross cash proceeds of approximately million 
after deducting offering costs totaling approximately million  the net cash proceeds of million were used to pay down our senior secured term debt 

table of contents during  we repaid million of our former senior secured debt and had borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit arrangement  primarily related to seasonal financing needs and energy technology segment capital expenditures 
as of september   we had million outstanding under this arrangement  all of which was repaid with proceeds from the new senior secured debt issued in october in october  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
because the amount outstanding under the former revolving credit arrangement as of september  million was repaid with those proceeds  we classified it as long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the termination of the former credit facility and early repayment of the debt  we wrote off all remaining related debt issue costs  aggregating approximately million 
in addition  in connection with consultations related to recapitalization transactions that occurred in and other periods  we incurred million of costs that were expensed during the three months ended december   which amount is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations 
also in october  we entered into a million abl revolver for which we incurred approximately million of debt issue costs in significant terms of the new senior secured notes and the abl revolver  as well as all of our convertible senior subordinated notes are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we repurchased and canceled million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
terms of repayment included premiums totaling approximately million  which were recorded as interest expense 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were also charged to interest expense 
following these transactions  approximately million of these notes remained outstanding as of september  as a result of the debt restructuring that occurred in and  our interest costs have increased substantially 
during  we incurred total interest costs of approximately million  including approximately million of non cash interest expense and approximately million of interest costs that were capitalized 
during  we incurred total interest costs of approximately million  including approximately million of non cash interest expense and approximately million of interest costs that were capitalized 
interest costs in are currently expected to total approximately million  with less than million involving the expenditure of cash 
availability under the abl revolver cannot exceed million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
availability under the abl revolver is further limited by the borrowing base valuations of the assets of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments which secure the borrowings  currently consisting of certain trade receivables and inventories 
in addition to the first lien position on these assets  the abl revolver lenders have a second priority position on substantially all other assets 
as of september   availability under the abl revolver was approximately million 
the abl revolver matures in october  at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid and the lending commitment terminates 
there have been no borrowings under the abl revolver since it was entered into in october following the october issuance of new senior secured notes and the repayments of outstanding debt with most of those proceeds  there are currently no maturities of debt prior to  unless the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes exercise their put option in we also have the option in to redeem the notes 
following certain asset sales  as defined  we could be required to prepay a portion of the senior secured notes 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in may  the fasb issued new rules related to accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the new rules specify that issuers of convertible debt that can be settled in cash separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing 
table of contents rate when interest cost is recognized 
the adoption of the new rules on october  resulted in a redetermination of the carrying amounts of our convertible notes  convertible notes and convertible notes  calculated by measuring the fair values of similar debt instruments that do not have the conversion features  and recording an equity component for the difference between the original proceeds of the debt and the redetermined amounts of debt 
reference is made to note for a summary of the effect of the application of the new rules  which did not affect cash flow for any period  on our consolidated financial statements 
compliance with terms of senior secured notes and abl revolver 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  the senior secured notes and abl revolver limit the incurrence of additional debt and liens on assets  prepayment of subordinated debt  merging or consolidating with another company  selling assets  making capital expenditures  making acquisitions and investments and the payment of dividends or distributions  among other things 
in addition  if in the future the availability under the abl revolver is less than of the total million commitment  or million currently  we are required to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of at least i x for the preceding twelve month period for each month ending on or prior to december   and ii x for the preceding twelve month period for each month ending after december  as of september   availability under the abl revolver was approximately million 
however  due primarily to the seasonality of our operations  it is possible that the availability under the abl could fall below million in a future period 
as of september   our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the abl revolver agreement  is approximately the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing ebitdar minus capital expenditures and cash payments for income taxes by fixed charges 
ebitdar consists of net income loss i plus net interest expense  income taxes as defined  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges such as goodwill and other impairments  and rent expense  ii plus or minus other specified adjustments such as equity earnings or loss in joint ventures 
fixed charges consist of cash payments for debt service plus rent expense 
if availability under the abl revolver were to decline below million at some future date and the fixed charge coverage ratio were to also decline below or subsequent to december   the abl revolver lender could issue a notice of default 
management currently believes it is unlikely such a notice of default would occur because there are currently no outstanding borrowings under the abl revolver and under the current terms of the abl revolver  it is remote that there will be any outstanding borrowings in the foreseeable future 
if a notice of default were to become imminent  we would seek an amendment to the abl revolver  or alternatively  a waiver of the availability requirement and or fixed charge coverage ratio for a period of time 
approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering could commence under the registration statement 
in both and  cash proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of options were not material 
option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts were not material in either or working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million including million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of september  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from cash provided by operations and the issuance of new senior secured notes described previously 
in addition  notwithstanding the continuing pressure on our revenues as a result of existing 
table of contents economic conditions  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow in and in future years 
we believe the current amount of working capital will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months  and that it will not be necessary to utilize borrowing capacity under the abl revolver for our seasonal operational cash needs during that period of time 
income taxes 
for  during which we currently expect to realize a loss before income taxes  cash outlays for income taxes will be minimal 
we have utilized our and prior nols by carrying these amounts back to prior years  receiving income tax refunds totaling approximately million in the nols and tax credit carryforwards are offset by our existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  accordingly  in  there will be a full valuation allowance recorded on net deferred tax assets and our effective income tax rate could be near for the year 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
we recognize accrued interest and potential penalties related to all income tax liabilities  including unrecognized income tax benefits  in income tax expense 
as of september   approximately million was accrued for the payment of interest and penalties 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which amounts were not material in or option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price which is not predictable  and likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant cash requirements for  beyond seasonal operational working capital requirements  consist primarily of interest payments on long term debt and capital expenditures 
in years beyond  significant cash requirements will also include the repayment of debt  but not prior to  or june  if the convertible senior subordinated notes totaling approximately million are put to us 
reference is also made to note to the consolidated financial statements where the potential risks of future litigation are described in detail 
legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and for other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  but otherwise do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured notes convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations future maturities of long term debt as of september  are shown in the table above using debt that existed as of that date and considering the related contractually required repayment dates 
the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  totaling million  have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  if all of the holders of those notes required us to repurchase the notes in june instead of june  the timing of payment of million of debt obligations  along with the amount and timing of the related interest payments  would be different 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our new abl revolver provides for potential borrowings of up to million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments 
reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under employment agreements  long term incentive cash bonus awards  cash performance unit awards and executive change in control agreements 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of those agreements  depending upon the outcomes of the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
final resolutions of these matters that are different from our current expectations could affect the amounts included in the above table 
recent accounting pronouncements reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been recently issued which we have not yet adopted 
reference is made to note for a discussion of the new rules related to accounting for convertible debt that were adopted on october  and applied retrospectively to all periods subsequent to january 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to the activities of joint ventures 
the blue flint joint venture has derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
until we sold our interest in the south korean based evonik joint venture in late  it was subject to movements in foreign currency 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  our former senior debt totaling million as of september  bore interest at a variable rate  however  all of this debt was repaid in october  and currently we have no variable rate debt outstanding 
future borrowings  if any  under our new abl revolver will bear interest at a variable rate  as described in note subsequent to the sale in of our interest in the south korean joint venture with evonik industries ag  we have limited operations in foreign jurisdictions 
this joint venture was subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements through the date of sale 
during and  the joint venture recorded foreign currency exchange gains  of which million and million  respectively  were included in our results of operations 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the compensation committee approved grants of performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  to be settled in cash  based on the achievement of goals related to the second half of fiscal assuming the average closing stock price for the days in the period ended september  of remains unchanged for the september  and vesting dates  the maximum payout under this arrangement would be approximately million 
at each of the two vesting dates  the awards will be adjusted using the average stock price for the days immediately preceding the respective vest dates 
a change in the day stock price of from the september  average of would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the maximum payout liability 
it is the current intent of the committee to grant future performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  based on fiscal year performance periods  with terms similar to those described above  however  there is no obligation to do so 
subsequent to september   the committee approved such grants to participants in the corporate business unit related to consolidated free cash flow generated during also subsequent to september   the committee approved the grant to certain employees of approximately million cash settled stock appreciation rights sars 
these sars will vest in annual installments over the next three years  provided the participant is still employed at the respective vesting dates  and will be settled in cash upon exercise by the employee 
because our liability under the performance unit and sar grants is dependent on future stock prices  it will fluctuate in future periods accordingly
