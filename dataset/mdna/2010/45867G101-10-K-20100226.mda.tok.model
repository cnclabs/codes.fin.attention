item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto contained in this document 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry  and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
business we design and develop advanced digital wireless technologies for use in digital cellular and wireless ieee related products and networks 
we actively participate in and contribute our technology solutions to worldwide organizations responsible for the development and approval of standards to which digital cellular and ieee compliant products are built  and our contributions are regularly incorporated into such standards 
in addition  we develop solutions for improving bandwidth availability and network capacity  wireless security and seamless connectivity and mobility across networks and devices 
we offer licenses to our patents to equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular and ieee related products 
in addition  we offer for license or sale our mobile broadband modem solutions modem ip  know how  and reference platforms to mobile device manufacturers  semiconductor companies and other equipment producers that 
table of contents manufacture  use and sell digital cellular products 
we have built our suite of technology and patent offerings through independent development  joint development with other companies and selected acquisitions 
we have also assembled a number of leading technology partners that share our vision and complement our internal research and development efforts 
currently  we generate revenues primarily from royalties received under our patent license agreements 
we also generate revenues by licensing our technology solutions and providing related development support 
our goal is to derive revenue from every g mobile device sold  either in the form of patent licensing revenues  technology solutions related revenues or a combination of these elements 
as of december  we had entered into patent license agreements covering over one half of all g mobile devices sold worldwide 
in recent years  our patent license agreements have contributed the majority of our cash flow and revenues 
in addition  our technology solutions offer an additional means to generate revenue from g mobile devices and we continue to develop an array of technology solutions to address the evolution of wireless communications to a network of networks and to further improve the capabilities of wireless networks through connectivity  mobility and advanced intelligent data delivery techniques 
in   and our total revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  and our patent licensing revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
patent licensing revenue made up at least of our total revenues in each period 
in  the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments accounted for approximately of our patent licensing revenues 
due to the nature of the revenue recognition  these fixed fee revenues are not affected by the related licensees success in the market or the general economic climate 
the majority of the remaining portion of our patent licensing revenue is variable in nature due to the per unit nature of the related license agreements 
approximately of this per unit variable portion for related to sales of product by japanese licensees for whom the majority of the sales are within japan 
as a result  our per unit variable patent license royalties have been  and will continue to be  largely influenced by sales within the japanese market 
patent licensing samsung settlement and patent license on january   we entered into the samsung pla 
under the terms of the agreement  samsung agreed to pay million in four equal installments over an month period 
we recognized million of fixed fee revenue related to our agreement with samsung during during  we received the first two of four installments of million from samsung under the samsung pla 
as of december   million of accrued accounts receivable was recorded for the remaining two million installments  of which we received a scheduled million payment in january other license agreements during third quarter  we signed two additional patent license agreements  including our first agreement to specifically cover terminal units designed to operate in accordance with wimax  wibro  lte  and lte advanced standards and an agreement that covers the sale of machine to machine mm modules 
in connection with these agreements and a related stock purchase agreement  we have received or will be due million of fixed cash payments and common stock of one of our licensees valued at million  and variable royalties based on the sale of one of our licensee s mm modules 
patent licensing royalties patent license royalties in of million increased from the prior year and represented the most significant portion of our total revenue of million 
this million year over year increase in patent license royalties resulted from the samsung pla and the two additional patent license agreements signed in third quarter these new agreements more than offset the loss of revenue related to the expiration of our license agreements with certain licensees and a decline in per unit royalties resulting primarily from an overall decline in unit volume from our japanese licenses 
expiration of the lg license in december  we will complete our amortization of million of royalty revenue associated with our patent license agreement with lg 
lg contributed approximately million or of our revenue in this license covers the sale of i terminal units designed to operate in accordance with g and g tdma based and g standards  and ii infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with cdma technology and its extensions up to a limited threshold amount 
under the terms of the agreement  lg paid million in three equal installments from through upon expiration of the agreement  lg will receive a paid up license to sell single mode gsm gprs edge terminal units under the patents included under the license  and become unlicensed as to all other products covered under the agreement 

table of contents we continue to place substantial focus on renewing agreements that have or will expire and expanding our patent licensee base  both with the top tier handset manufacturers and other market participants 
nokia united states international trade commission decision on october   it was announced that in the us international trade commission usitc investigation initiated by us against nokia  the usitc issued a notice that it reviewed in part the initial determination id by the chief administrative law judge alj and found no violation of section and has terminated the investigation 
in the id  the alj found interdigital s patents valid and enforceable  but also determined that the patents were not infringed by nokia s g products 
the usitc action originated in august  when we filed a complaint with the usitc alleging that nokia engaged in unfair trade practices by selling for importation into the united states  importing  and selling after importation  certain g handsets and components that infringe four of our us patents 
during december  we filed an appeal of the usitc s decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in such an appeal  we can raise any of the issues raised in its august  petition  except for the construction of the term synchronize  on which the commission took no position 
the issue of validity  on which the commission also took no position  likewise cannot be raised in such an appeal 
cash and short term investments at december   we had million of cash and short term investments 
a substantial portion of this balance relates to fixed and prepaid royalty payments we have received that relate to future sales of our licensees products 
as a result  our cash receipts from existing licenses subject to fixed and prepaid royalties will be reduced in future periods 
we currently plan to preserve a significant portion of our cash and short term investments to finance our business in the near future and will review our cash and short term investment position if and when we receive new prepaid royalty payments or sign new patent license agreements 
during  we recorded million of cash receipts related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements as follows in thousands current royalties prepaid royalties and past sales fixed royalty payments technology solutions these cash receipts contributed to a million increase in our cash and short term investments and  together with a million increase in accounts receivable  resulted in a million increase in deferred revenue to million at december  approximately million of our million deferred revenue balance relates to fixed royalty payments that are scheduled to amortize as follows in thousands thereafter the remaining million of deferred revenue relates to prepaid royalties which will be recorded as revenue as our licensees report their sales of covered products 
based on information provided by the related licensees  we expect the prepaid royalty balance will cover sales of related products for several years 
we continue to place substantial focus on renewing agreements that have or will expire and expanding our patent licensee base  both with the top tier handset manufacturers and other market participants 
repositioning on march   we announced a repositioning plan that includes the expansion of the technology development and licensing business  the cessation of further product development of the slimchip modem technology  and efforts to monetize the technology investment through ip 
table of contents licensing and technology sales 
in connection with the repositioning  the company incurred a charge of million during of this amount  approximately million represents non cash asset impairments that relate to assets used in the product and product development  including million of acquired intangible assets and million of property  equipment  and other assets 
in addition  the repositioning resulted in a reduction in force of approximately employees across the company s three locations  the majority of which were terminated effective april  approximately million of the repositioning charge represents cash obligations associated with severance and contract termination costs 
we do not expect to incur any additional cost related to this repositioning 
repurchase of common stock in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock the repurchase program 
in october  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
in march  our board of directors authorized another million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
the company could repurchase shares under the programs through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans  or privately negotiated purchases 
we completed the repurchase program in first half  under which we repurchased a cumulative total of million shares of common stock for million  including million shares of common stock for million repurchased during under the repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for million in during we completed the repurchase program  under which we repurchased a cumulative total of million shares for million  including million shares we repurchased for million in during  we repurchased approximately million shares for million under the repurchase program 
from january  through february   no repurchases were made under the repurchase program 
intellectual property rights enforcement from time to time  if we believe any party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain digital cellular products and such party has not done so  we may institute legal action against them 
this legal action typically takes the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the us international trade commission usitc 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our patent litigation and arbitration costs decreased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
patent litigation and arbitration costs will vary depending upon activity levels and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 
comparability of financial results when comparing financial results against other periods  the following item should be taken into consideration our revenue included million of royalties related to past sales recognized in connection with a new licensee and the resolution of an audit of one of our licensees 
our operating expense included a million repositioning charge in connection with our first quarter decision to cease further product development of our slimchip modern technology 
our operating expenses are net of the reversal of million of compensation expense that was originally recorded in the adjustment was based on our revised expectations for the anticipated payout associated with a long term performance based incentive program 
this adjustment reduced development expense  selling  general and administrative expense  and patent licensing and arbitration costs by million  million  and million  respectively 
our selling  general and administrative expense is net of the reversal of million of bad debt expense 
the reversal related to the collection of million accounts receivable for which we had established a full reserve in prior periods 
our income tax expense is net of a million tax benefit that relates to our plan to amend our us federal income tax returns for prior years to switch the foreign tax payments we made during those years from deductions to foreign tax credits 
our recognition of this tax benefit is based upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
the process to amend these returns is complicated and involves tax treaty procedures for both us and foreign tax authorities 
it is possible that at the conclusion of this process  the million benefit may not be realized in full or in part  or that we may realize a benefit of up to million 

table of contents our interest and investment loss income includes a million charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in kineto wireless to approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to revenue recognition  compensation  and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and include multiple elements 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  advanced payments and fees for service arrangements  and settlement of outstanding patent litigation 
due to the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable  and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may often be recognized over the performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
we establish a receivable for payments expected to be received within twelve months from the balance sheet date based on the terms in the license 
our reporting of such payments often results in an increase to both accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue associated with fixed fee royalty payments is classified on the balance sheet as short term when it is scheduled to be amortized within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
all other deferred revenue is classified as long term  as amounts to be recognized over the next twelve months are not known 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the guidance for revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the licensee 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for prior sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a 
table of contents disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive consideration for prior sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price  and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
fixed fee royalty payments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products  under certain patents or patent claims  for sales in certain countries  or a combination thereof in each case for a specified time period including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
prepayments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties typically extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments these are royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances are obligated to provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
we recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our licensees  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited 
the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
from time to time  licensees will not report revenues in the proper period  most often due to legal disputes 
when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of products covered under a patent license agreement with us  we recognize any related deferred revenue balance in the period that we receive such evidence 
during  we recognized revenue of million related to unpaid patent licensee royalties 
we based our recognition of this revenue on royalty reports received  despite the fact that the licensee had expressed its belief that it did not have a current payment obligation 
we believed that we were entitled to these royalty payments and the eventual collection of these amounts was reasonably assured  we subsequently collected these amounts in technology solutions revenue technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the original and revised guidance for software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with a customer includes significant production  modification  or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs  and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts on a straight line basis  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred labor hours and total estimated labor hours or other measures of progress  if available 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees and more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  an annual bonus tied to performance goals  cash awards to inventors for 
table of contents filed patent applications and patent issuances  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and a long term compensation program ltcp for managers that includes both time based and performance based rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
the ltcp is designed to alternate between rsu and cash cycles  each of which cover a three year period and can overlap with another cycle by as many as two years 
the cycles relevant to the reporting period are cash cycle a a long term performance cash incentive covering the period july  through december   rsu cycle rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january   rsu cycle rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january   cash cycle a long term performance cash incentive covering the period january  through december   and rsu cycle rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january  we recognized share based compensation expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the majority of the share based compensation expense  for all years  related to rsu awards granted to managers under our ltcp 
we also recognized million  million  and million of compensation expense in   and  respectively  related to the performance based cash incentive under our ltcp 
the amount includes a credit of million to reduce the accrual rate for cash cycle of our ltcp from to based on revised expectations for a lower payout 
this million adjustment related to the reduction of our accrual established in the prior year 
the amount includes a fourth quarter charge of million to increase our accrual for cash cycle a from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout was driven by the company s success in achieving a number of key goals  including signing lg and samsung  two of the top five cellular handset oems  to g licensing agreements 
these licenses helped increase our share of the g market under license from approximately to approximately  and drove substantial positive operating cash flow over the period 
due to the credit to adjust the accrual rate on cash cycle and the structure of the different cycles in the ltcp  we expect that expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive and rsus will be approximately million more than however  the amount recorded could either increase or decrease dependent upon both the number of employees that qualify for the ltcp and our future assessment of the expected attainment of pre established performance goals 
at december   accrued compensation expense associated with the ltcp s performance based cash incentive was based on an estimated payout of for cash cycle under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based cash incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of and no payout for performance that falls below of target results 
the following table provides examples of the performance based cash incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater if we had assumed that goal achievement for cash cycle was  we would have accrued million of related compensation expense through december  if we had assumed that goal achievement for cash cycle would be either or  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  however  our estimated accrual could either increase or decrease in the future dependent upon our assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals 
during  the equity component of the ltcp was amended such that  beginning with the january  grant  executives now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the amendment  the company s managers now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based rsu incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by 
table of contents percentage points with a maximum payout of 
for performance that falls below of target  no share payout would occur 
the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater at december   we did not meet the criteria specified by the accounting guidance for stock based compensation to accrue performance based equity compensation associated with either the rsu cycle or rsu cycle grants 
if we had met the criteria with goal achievement  we would have accrued million of related compensation expense through december  we will establish an accrual for the performance based rsus under rsu cycle in the future if our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals meets certain criteria for performance based share compensation 
rsu cycle ended on january  with less than goal achievement 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fourth quarter  we completed a study to assess the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryovers into the tax year as a result of the study  we are currently planning to amend our united states federal income tax returns for the periods to reclaim the foreign tax payments we made during those periods from deductions to foreign tax credits 
we have established a basis to support amending the returns and estimate that the maximum incremental benefit will be approximately million 
we recorded a net benefit of million after establishing a million reserve for related tax contingencies 
the process to amend these returns is complicated involving tax treaty proceedings including both us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
it is possible that at the conclusion of this process the million benefit we recognized may not be realized in full or in part or that we may realize the maximum benefit of million 
between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss 
new accounting guidance determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance related to the determination as to whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under this guidance  unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share computation pursuant to the two class method 
we adopted this guidance on january  and  in 
table of contents accordance with this guidance  have retrospectively adjusted prior period earnings per share data 
the table below displays the as previously reported and as adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and refer to the most recent form q quarterly filing for the quarterly basic and diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december  as previously reported net income per share basic net income per share diluted as adjusted net income per share basic net income per share diluted accounting standards updates revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the fasb finalized revenue recognition guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the accounting standard update related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics and will often result in earlier revenue recognition 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under this new guidance 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  however  adoption was permitted as early as interim period ended september  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively 
we have not yet adopted this guidance 
based upon our preliminary assessment of the impact of this guidance  we believe that revenue recognition may be accelerated in the future 
we will continue to evaluate this guidance so that we can determine the impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations upon adoption 
legal proceedings we are routinely involved in disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including litigations and other proceedings 
these litigations and other proceedings are important means to enforce our intellectual property rights 
a january settlement of various litigations and other proceedings with samsung resulted in a million patent license agreement 
we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
refer to item of part i of this form k for a complete description of our material legal proceedings 
financial position  liquidity  and capital requirements our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as cash generated from operations 
we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings  but have not had a significant debt or equity financing in over years 
based on our past performance and current expectations  we believe our available sources of funds  including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to finance our operations  capital requirements  and any stock repurchase programs that we may initiate in the next twelve months 
although our existing revenue streams have been affected by the recent global economic downturn  our near term revenues are partially insulated from market swings since approximately of our patent license revenues were based on fixed payments in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and december   we had the following amounts of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands 
table of contents december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to our receipts of the first two of four million installments from samsung under our recently signed patent license agreement and new prepayments from two existing licensees totaling million 
after using these and other receipts to fund our operations  working capital requirements  and share repurchases in  we invested the excess in short term investments 
cash flows from operations we generated the following cash flows from our operating activities in and in thousands for the year ended december  increase decrease cash flows from operating activities the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements 
these receipts included the first two of four installments of million from samsung under our january license agreement 
we also received prepayments of million from two existing licensees  per unit royalty payments of million from other existing or new licensees  other fixed fee payments of million  and cash receipts from our technology solutions customers totaling million  primarily related to royalties associated with our slimchip modem ip 
these receipts  along with a million increase in net working capital  were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  non cash repositioning charges  and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million primarily related to samsung and pantech cash receipts  an estimated federal tax payment of million  and a million payment on long term cash incentive plans 
the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to patent licensing and technology solution agreements 
these receipts included the final million payment from lg  a new prepayment of million from an existing licensee  per unit royalty payments of million from other existing licensees  other fixed fee payments of million  and cash receipts from our technology solutions totaling million  primarily related to royalties associated with our slimchip modem ip 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million  estimated federal income tax payments of million  and million of other changes in working capital during working capital we believe that working capital  adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  current maturities of debt  and current deferred revenue provides additional information about assets and liabilities that may affect our near term liquidity 
our adjusted working capital  a non gaap financial measure  reconciles to working capital  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  at december  and december  in thousands 
table of contents for the year ended december  increase decrease current assets current liabilities working capital subtract add cash and cash equivalents short term investments current portion of long term debt current deferred revenue adjusted working capital the million increase in adjusted working capital from to is primarily due to our recently signed patent license agreement with samsung 
our recognition of the last two installment payments under this agreement  one of which we received during first quarter and the other which is due from samsung within the next twelve months  increased accounts receivable by million 
deferred tax assets increased million  primarily related to a timing difference in the recognition of deferred revenue for book and tax purposes 
the decrease in accrued compensation related to first quarter payments against our long term cash incentive plan further contributed to the increase in adjusted working capital 
these items were partially offset by an increase of million in foreign taxes payable associated with the samsung and pantech license agreements and the increase of million in other accrued expenses primarily attributable to accrued legal fees and accrued repositioning charges 
cash used in investing and financing activities we used net cash from investing activities of million in and we obtained net cash from investing activities of million in we purchased million of short term marketable securities  net of sales  in and we sold million of short term marketable securities  net of purchases  in this increase in purchases was driven by higher cash receipts  as discussed above  and lower cash requirements due to our repositioning during purchases of property and equipment and capitalized technology costs decreased to million in from million in due to the lower levels of development tools and engineering equipment needed in due to our cessation of further slimchip product development 
investment costs associated with patents increased from million in to million in in connection with the continued growth of our patent portfolio 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million primarily due to our reduced levels of stock repurchase activity in we also received million and million more in respective contributions from option exercises and tax benefits from share based compensation as compared to the prior year 
other our combined short term and long term deferred revenue balance at december  was approximately million  an increase of million from december  we have no material obligations associated with such deferred revenue 
in  we recorded gross increases in deferred revenue of million primarily related to the million received or due from samsung under the samsung pla license agreement signed in january  million in prepayments from two existing licensees  and million of cash received or due and stock received from a new licensee 
prepayments are non refundable payments towards a licensee s future obligations to pay royalties  and typically cover to year periods 
the gross increases in deferred revenue were partially offset by deferred revenue recognition of million related to the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments  million related to per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees  and the recognition of deferred revenue related to technology solutions agreements 
based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million over the next twelve months 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances

we expect our effective tax rate in to return to levels slightly above the federal statutory rate of 
however  our effective tax rate could be affected by further adjustments to the carrying value of our foreign tax credits until the resolution of the related tax treaty proceedings 
such adjustments would be dictated by changes in facts and circumstances and are very difficult to predict 
we continue to place substantial focus on renewing agreements that have or will expire and expanding our patent licensee base  both with the top tier handset manufactures and other market participants 
in addition we are pursuing opportunities to license our modem ip which  if successful  could add incremental technology services revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and investments the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government obligations  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a number of diversified high quality investment grade fixed and floating rate securities with a fair value of million at december  our exposure to interest rate risks is not significant due to the short average maturity  quality  and diversification of our holdings 
we do not hold any derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other similar financial 
table of contents instruments in our portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is generally limited to our investment portfolio 
we believe that a hypothetical change in period end interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates in millions thereafter total money market and demand accounts cash equivalents short term investments interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
bank liquidity risk as of december   we have approximately million in operating accounts that are held with domestic and international financial institutions 
the majority of these balances are held with domestic financial institutions 
while we monitor daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be lost or become inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or if they are unable to meet the liquidity requirements of their depositors 
notwithstanding  we have not incurred any losses and have had full access to our operating accounts to date 
we believe any failures of our domestic financial institutions could significantly impact our ability to fund our operations in the short term 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies  which might change over time as our business practices evolve  that could impact our operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
we operate and invest globally 
adverse movements in currency exchange rates might negatively affect our business due to a number of situations 
currently  our international licensing agreements are typically made in us dollars and are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions at this time 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our short term and long term investments in addition to the liquidity and credit worthiness of the underlying issuers of our investments 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
this policy also limits our amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
given that the guidelines of our investment policy prohibit us from investing in anything but highly rated instruments  our investments are not subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates for such securities 
our marketable securities  consisting of government obligations  corporate bonds  and commercial paper  are classified as available for sale with fair values of million as of december  credit market risk since september  there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that has led to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic recession
