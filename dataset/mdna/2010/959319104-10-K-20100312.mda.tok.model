company overview we are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products and also operate service stations and convenience stores 
we own and operate three refineries with a total crude oil throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day  or bpd 
in addition to our  bpd refinery in el paso  texas  we own and operate a  bpd refinery on the east coast of the united states near yorktown  virginia and a refinery near gallup  new mexico with a throughput capacity of approximately  bpd 
until november  we also operated a  bpd refinery near bloomfield  new mexico 
we indefinitely suspended refining operations at the bloomfield refinery in late november we continue to operate bloomfield as a refinery terminal 
our primary operating areas encompass west texas  arizona  new mexico  utah  colorado  and the mid atlantic region 
in addition to the refineries  we also own and operate stand alone refined product distribution terminals in albuquerque  new mexico  near flagstaff  arizona  and bloomfield  new mexico  as well as asphalt terminals in phoenix and tucson  arizona  albuquerque  and el paso 
as of december   we also own and operate retail service stations and convenience stores in arizona  colorado  and new mexico  a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports  and a wholesale petroleum products distributor  that operates in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  new mexico  texas  and utah 
on may   we completed the acquisition of giant 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we acquired of giant s  outstanding shares for per share in cash for a total purchase price of  million  funded primarily through a  million secured term loan 
in connection with the acquisition  we borrowed an additional million in july  when we paid off and retired giant s and senior subordinated notes 
prior to the acquisition of giant  we generated substantially all of our revenues from our refining operations in el paso 
with the acquisition of giant  we also gained a diverse mix of complementary retail and wholesale businesses 
since the acquisition of giant  we have increased our sour and heavy crude oil processing capacity as a percent of our total crude oil capacity from prior to the acquisition to approximately as of december  sour and heavy crude oil has historically been less expensive to acquire than light sweet crude oil 
however  beginning in the second quarter of  price differentials have narrowed between sour and heavy crude oil and light sweet crude oil  particularly the heavy crude oil price differential at our yorktown refinery has been significantly reduced 
we have deferred certain smaller projects at our south crude unit in el paso due to the narrow spread between sweet and sour crude oil and the overall economic environment 
deferment of the crude unit projects will limit sour runs to our current combined sour and heavy crude oil processing capability at maximum throughput until the projects in the crude unit are complete 
we own a pipeline that runs from southeast new mexico to northwest new mexico 
the pipeline can transport crude oil from southeast new mexico to the four corners region and south from lynch  new mexico to jal  new mexico 
this pipeline provides us with an alternative method of transportation within new mexico and an alternative supply of crude oil for our gallup refinery 
in addition  along with rail deliveries  this pipeline is capable of providing enough crude oil for the gallup refinery to run full capacity 
based on lower product demand in the 
table of contents four corners area  we have removed the crude from portions of the pipeline  and we do not currently transport crude via pipeline from southeast new mexico 
however  we presently use sections of the pipeline to deliver crude to our gallup refinery  and to transport crude for unrelated third parties 
we regularly evaluate cost effective and alternative sources of crude oil and operations of this pipeline 
see item a 
risk factors we may not have sufficient crude oil to be able to run our gallup refinery at the historical rates of our four corners refineries in this annual report 
following the acquisition of giant  we began reporting our operating results in three business segments the refining group  the retail group  and the wholesale group 
our refining group operates the three refineries and related refined product distribution terminals and asphalt terminals 
at the refineries  we refine crude oil and other feedstocks into finished products such as gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel  and asphalt 
our refineries market finished products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our retail group operates service stations and convenience stores and sells gasoline  diesel fuel  and merchandise 
our wholesale group distributes gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant products 
see note  segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for detailed information on our operating results by segment 
major influences on results of operations refining 
our earnings and cash flows from our refining operations are primarily affected by the difference between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks  all of which are commodities 
the cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined products that we ultimately sell depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the supply of  and demand for  crude oil  gasoline  and other refined products  which in turn depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels  the price differentials on sour and heavy crude oils versus light sweet crude oils  and government regulation 
while our net sales fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil and refined product prices  it is primarily the spread between crude oil and refined product prices that affects our earnings and cash flows from our operations 
refining margins were extremely volatile in and while gasoline margins were somewhat improved during compared to  diesel margins were significantly weaker in the benchmark gulf coast unleaded gasoline price compared to wti crude oil in was compared to in the benchmark gulf coast diesel fuel price compared to wti crude oil in averaged margin per barrel compared to margin per barrel in additionally  the increase in the price of crude oil during the second  third  and fourth quarters of significantly reduced margins on asphalt and coke as compared to the first quarter of another factor that reduced margins during the last three quarters of was the narrowing of price differentials on sour and heavy crude oils versus light sweet crude oils 
in particular  the pricing differential on the heavy crude oil that we process at our yorktown refinery narrowed by approximately per barrel in as compared to our yorktown refinery can process up to of heavy crude oil  but margins can be significantly impacted by the pricing differential between heavy versus wti crude oil  as was the case for the last three quarters of in addition  we had changes in our lcm reserve of million related to our yorktown inventories that decreased our cost of products sold for the year ended december   resulting in increased refining margins 
this million lcm reserve was initially recognized during the fourth quarter of and resulted in an increase to our cost of products sold and decreased refining margins for the year ended december  other factors that impact our overall refinery gross margins are the sale of lower value products such as residuum  petroleum coke  and propane  particularly when crude costs are higher 
in addition  our refinery gross margin is further reduced because our refinery product yield is less than our total refinery throughput volume 
for example  our yorktown refinery liquid products yield for was 
coke production made up the majority of the balance of the product yield 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by our refineries direct operating expenses  especially the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months 
in addition  higher volumes of ethanol are blended with gasoline produced in the southwest region during the winter months  
table of contents thereby increasing the supply of gasoline 
this combination of decreased demand and increased supply during the winter months can lower gasoline prices 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
the effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by increased demand during the winter months for diesel fuel in the southwest and heating oil in the northeast 
throughout  however  refining margins were extremely volatile and our results of operations do not reflect these seasonal trends 
safety  reliability and the environmental performance of our refineries operations are critical to our financial performance 
unplanned downtime of our refineries generally results in lost refinery gross margin opportunity  increased maintenance costs  and a temporary increase in working capital investment and inventory 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime  such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project  through a planning process that considers product availability  margin environment  and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance 
periodically we have planned maintenance turnarounds at our refineries  which are expensed as incurred 
we shut down the south crude unit for days at the el paso refinery in the second quarter of and we performed a crude unit inspection outage for days at the yorktown refinery in october we completed a scheduled turnaround at the south side of the el paso refinery during the first quarter of we have scheduled crude and coker unit turnarounds at the yorktown refinery during the third quarter of the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
because crude oil and refined products are commodities  we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories 
our inventory of crude oil and the majority of our refined products are valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation methodology 
if the market values of our inventories decline below our cost basis  we would record a write down of our inventories resulting in a non cash charge to our cost of products sold 
market value declines during the year ended december  resulted in non cash charges to our cost of products sold of million 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
based on market conditions  we recorded non cash recoveries of million related to the lcm charges 
in addition  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil and other blendstocks  we experienced fluctuations in our lifo reserves between and we also experienced lifo liquidations based on permanent decreased levels in our inventories 
these lifo liquidations resulted in a decrease in cost of products sold of million for the year ended december  and an increase of million in cost of products sold for the year ended december  there were no lifo liquidations for the year ended december  see note  inventories in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the impact of lifo inventory accounting 
retail 
our earnings and cash flows from our retail business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel sold  and by the sales and margins of merchandise sold at our service stations and convenience stores 
margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes  and are measured on a cents per gallon  or cpg  basis 
fuel margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
margins for retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the merchandise  net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage  and are measured as a percentage of merchandise sales 
merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location  branding  and competition 
our retail sales are seasonal 
our retail business segment operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
wholesale 
our earnings and cash flows from our wholesale business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricants sold 
margins for gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant sales are equal to the sales price less cost of sales 
margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
goodwill impairment loss 
we had a policy to test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
various indications of possible goodwill impairment prompted us to perform goodwill impairment analyses at december  and march  we determined that no such impairment existed as of those dates 
our annual impairment test was performed as of june  the performance of the 
table of contents test is a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
from the first to the second quarter of  there was a decline in margins within the refining industry as well as a downward change in industry analysts forecasts for the remainder of and this  along with other negative financial forecasts released by independent refiners during the latter part of the second quarter of  contributed to declines in common stock trading prices within the independent refining sector  including declines in our common stock trading price 
as a result  our equity market capitalization fell below the net book value of our assets 
through the filing date of our second quarter form q and through the end of the fourth quarter  the trading price of our stock had experienced further reductions 
we completed step of the impairment test during the second quarter of and concluded that impairment existed 
consistent with the preliminary step analysis completed during the second quarter of  we concluded that all of the goodwill in four of our six reporting units was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter results of operations 
we finalized our step analysis during the third quarter of there were no such impairment charges in previous years 
long lived asset impairment loss 
in accordance with financial accounting standards codification  or fasc   property  plant  and equipment or fasc  we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in order to test long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated  which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected volumes  margins  and cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
in the fourth quarter of we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and maintain the site as a product distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested the bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million  respectively  of impairment losses existed in certain bloomfield refinery related long lived and intangible assets 
a non cash impairment loss of million related to the long lived assets and certain intangibles is included under other impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  factors impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 
acquisition of giant on may   we completed the acquisition of giant 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we acquired of giant s  outstanding shares for per share in cash for a total purchase price of  million  funded primarily through a  million secured term loan 
in connection with the acquisition  we borrowed an additional million in july  when we paid off and retired giant s and senior subordinated notes 
our statements of operations for the years ended december  and include interest expense of million  net of million of capitalized interest and million  net of million of capitalized interest  respectively  associated with this term loan and the revolving credit facility 
the 
table of contents decrease in interest expense related to the term loan for the year ended december  was the result of early retirement of million of this debt using the net proceeds from our debt and equity offerings during interest expense associated with this term loan and the revolving credit facility for the year ended december   was million  net of million of capitalized interest  for the seven months we operated giant 
prior to the acquisition of giant on may   we generated substantially all of our revenues from our refining operations in el paso 
the financial information for the year ended december  and includes the results of operations of the three refineries and the retail and wholesale operations acquired from giant  however  the financial information for the year ended december   includes only seven months of operations from these assets acquired from giant 
senior secured notes  convertible senior notes  and equity offering during the second and third quarters of  we issued million in senior secured notes and million in convertible senior notes 
the senior secured notes consist of two tranches  the first consisting of million in fixed rate aggregate principal amount notes and the second consisting of million floating rate aggregate principal amount notes 
the interest rate on the floating rate notes was at issuance in june proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes  net of original issue and underwriting discounts were million 
the convertible senior notes consist of million in aggregate principal amount notes 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes were million  net of underwriting discounts 
during the second quarter of  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock at an aggregate offering price of million 
the proceeds of this issuance were million  net of million in underwriting discounts 
the combined proceeds from the issuance and sale of the senior secured notes  the convertible senior notes  and our common stock were used to early retire million of our outstanding indebtedness under our term loan credit agreement 
see note  long term debt and note  stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the issuance and composition of these notes 
asset impairments during the second quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and as a result concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter results of operations 
this charge was reported under goodwill impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and maintain the site as a refinery distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested the bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million in refinery related long lived and intangible assets  respectively  were impaired 
a non cash impairment loss of million related to the long lived assets and certain intangibles is included under other impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  write off of unamortized loan fees during the second and third quarters of  we made principal payments on our term loan of million primarily from the net proceeds of our debt and common stock offerings 
accordingly  we expensed million during the second quarter of to write off a portion of the unamortized loan fees related to the term loan 
additionally  in june  we amended our revolving credit agreement and term loan 
as a result of such amendment  we recorded an expense of million related to the write off of deferred loan fees incurred in may see note  long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on our long term debt 

table of contents environmental cost recoveries  property tax refunds  and other during  we recovered million from various third parties related to environmental costs recorded during and prior years 
these recoveries are included in direct operating expenses reported for the year ended december  additionally  during  we decreased our property tax estimate by million resulting from revised el paso property appraisal rolls for through the revision to the property appraisal rolls also resulted in a refund of million from various taxing authorities  further reducing our property tax expense to a total decrease of million for the year ended december  we also recorded a fourth quarter legal settlement charge of million 
planned maintenance turnaround during and  we incurred costs of million and million  respectively for maintenance turnarounds 
primarily during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred costs of million in a crude unit shutdown and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the first quarter of at the el paso refinery  and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the third quarter of at the yorktown refinery 
the maintenance turnaround was performed during the fourth quarter at the north side of the el paso refinery 
during the third quarter of  we performed a scheduled maintenance turnaround on the ultraformer unit at the yorktown refinery at a cost of million  most of which was expensed in the same quarter and incurred costs of million in anticipation of the turnaround at the north side of the el paso refinery 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
most of our competitors  however  capitalize and amortize maintenance turnarounds 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
in order to apply these principles  we must make judgments  assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time 
actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events  some of which we may have little or no control over 
our critical accounting policies  which are discussed below  could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements 
purchase accounting 
we accounted for the acquisition of giant under the purchase method as required by fasc  business combinations  or fasc  with western as the accounting acquirer 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the price paid by us for giant was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired represents goodwill that was allocated to the reporting units and subject to annual impairment testing 
we performed a purchase price allocation for the acquisition of giant on may  the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management s evaluations of those assets and liabilities 
management obtained an independent appraisal to assist them in determining these values 
see note  acquisition of giant industries  inc in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of the purchase price allocation 
inventories 
crude oil  refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally under the lifo valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues 
ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net realizable market values and charged to cost of products sold in the period recorded 
in subsequent periods  a new lower of cost or market determination is made based upon current circumstances 
we determine market value inventory adjustments by evaluating crude oil  refined products  and other inventories on an aggregate basis by geographic region 
aggregated lifo costs were less than the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories by million at december  retail refined product fuel inventory values are determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
retail merchandise inventory value is determined under the retail inventory method 
wholesale finished product  lubricant and related inventories are determined using the fifo inventory valuation method 
finished product inventories originate from either our refineries or from third party purchases 

table of contents maintenance turnaround expense 
the units at our refineries require regular major maintenance and repairs commonly referred to as turnarounds 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit but generally is every four years 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
these costs are identified as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets 
when assets are placed in service  we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives 
for assets to be disposed of  we report long lived assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
in accordance with fasc  property  plant  and equipment  we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in order to test long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated  which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and maintain the site as a refinery distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested the bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million and million in refinery related long lived and intangible assets  respectively  were impaired 
a non cash impairment loss of million related to the long lived assets and certain intangibles is included under other impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is carried at cost 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment if any events and circumstances arise during a quarter that indicates goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
within our refining segment  we have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
our retail and wholesale segments are considered reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
our goodwill was assigned to two of our three refining reporting units and to our retail and wholesale reporting units 
in accordance with fasc  intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes 
various indications of possible goodwill impairment prompted us to perform goodwill impairment analyses at december  and march  we determined that no such impairment existed as of those dates 
our annual impairment test was performed as of june  the performance of the test is a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
from the first to the second quarter of  there was a decline in margins within the refining industry as well as a downward change in industry analysts forecasts for the remainder of and this  along with other negative financial forecasts released by independent refiners during the latter part of the second quarter of  contributed to declines in common stock trading prices within the independent refining sector  including declines in our common stock trading price 
as a result  our equity market capitalization fell below the net book value of our 
table of contents assets 
through the filing date of our second quarter form q and through the end of the fourth quarter  the trading price of our stock has experienced further reductions 
we completed step of the impairment test during the second quarter of and concluded that impairment existed 
we finalized our step analysis during the third quarter of consistent with the preliminary step analysis completed during the second quarter of  we concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter results of operations 
there were no such impairment charges during or we apply fasc in determining the useful economic lives of intangible assets that are acquired 
fasc requires that we amortize intangible assets  such as rights of way  licenses  and permits over their economic useful lives  unless the economic useful lives of the assets are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is determined to be indefinite  then that asset is not amortized 
we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset when the intangible asset is acquired 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our existing intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
environmental and other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities for loss contingencies  including environmental remediation costs  when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
environmental costs are expensed if they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations with no future economic benefit 
estimates of projected environmental costs are made based upon internal and third party assessments of contamination  available remediation technology  and environmental regulations 
loss contingency accruals  including those for environmental remediation  are subject to revision as further information develops or circumstances change and such accruals can take into account the legal liability of other parties 
as a result of purchase accounting related to the giant acquisition  the majority of our environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of giant are recorded on a discounted basis 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate is used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than other  the lower end of the range is used 
possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they become probable 
legal costs associated with environmental remediation  as defined in fasc  environmental obligations  are included as part of the estimated liability 
we have million accrued at december  for environmental obligations 
asset retirement obligations  or aros 
we account for our aros in accordance with fasc  asset retirement and environmental obligations  or fasc the estimated fair value of the aro is based on the estimated current cost escalated by an inflation rate and discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this liability is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized using the straight line method 
the liability accretes until we settle the liability 
legally restricted assets have been set aside for purposes of settling certain of the aro liabilities 
financial instruments and fair value 
we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices 
we use commodity future contracts  price swaps  and options to reduce price volatility  to fix margins for refined products  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and blendstock inventories 
all derivatives entered into by us are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and those instruments are measured at fair value 
we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for these instruments for financial accounting purposes 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are recognized in gain loss from derivative activities using mark to market accounting 
pension and other postretirement obligations 
pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  future compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  health care cost trends and demographic data 
changes in our actuarial assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control and can have a significant effect on our pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs 
under fasc  compensation retirement benefits  a defined benefit postretirement plan sponsor must a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or liability for the plan s underfunded status  
table of contents b measure the plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  as a component of other comprehensive income  the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
we terminated our defined benefit plan covering certain el paso refinery employees during the termination resulted in a reduction to our related pension obligation of million with a corresponding reduction of million  before the effect of income taxes  to other comprehensive loss 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock awards granted under the western refining long term incentive plan in accordance with fasc  compensation stock compensation  or fasc under fasc  the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of each share of restricted stock awarded is measured based on the market price at closing as of the measurement date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting 
we believe that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on our accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows when implemented

outlook the impact of a continued weak economy  reduced demand for refined products  and narrowing differentials between light and heavy crude oil prices negatively impacted our refining margins throughout much of new global refining capacity has also led to an increase in refined product inventories that has caused downward pressure on margins 
until the economy recovers and demand improves  we expect refining margins to continue to be negatively impacted 
also  as a result of these current unfavorable industry fundamentals  several refineries in north america have been temporarily or permanently idled 
our refining margins have shown some improvement in january and february of as compared to the fourth quarter of  particularly in the southwest 
through the end of february both the gulf coast and new york harbor benchmark crack spreads are more than higher than the fourth quarter of  primarily due to increased gasoline crack spreads as we approach the spring driving season 
however  refining margins remain volatile due to current market conditions 
additionally  the recent financial performance of our yorktown refinery has negatively impacted our overall results of operations 
in addition to current market conditions  there are other long term factors that may decrease the demand for refined products  as well as increase the cost to produce refined products 
these factors include the increased mileage standards for vehicles  the mandated renewable fuel standards  proposed climate change legislation  regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act  and competing refineries overseas

table of contents western refining long term incentive plan  and dividends paid million 
cash provided by financing activities included the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation expense million 
working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities  existing cash balances  and our revolving credit facility 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
refining margins were extremely volatile throughout and for example  our refining margins were per throughput barrel in the fourth quarter of  then decreased from per throughput barrel in the first quarter of to per throughput barrel in the second quarter of to per throughput barrel in the third quarter of to per throughput barrel in the fourth quarter of these changes in refining margins are attributable to the spread between crude oil and refined product prices 
while gasoline margins somewhat improved during compared to  diesel margins were significantly weaker in additionally  the increase in the price of crude oil during the second  third  and fourth quarters of significantly reduced margins on asphalt and coke as compared to the first quarter of another factor that reduced margins during the last three quarters of was the narrowing of price differentials on sour and heavy crude oils versus light sweet crude oils  in particular  the pricing differential on the heavy crude oil that we process at our yorktown refinery narrowed by approximately per barrel in as compared to in the fourth quarter of  our margins were lower primarily due to reduced gasoline prices compared to crude oil costs  and a non cash inventory write down of million to value our yorktown inventories to net realizable market values as a result of declining crude oil  blendstocks  and finished products prices 
if our margins deteriorate significantly  or if our earnings and cash flows suffer for any other reason  we could be unable to comply with the financial covenants set forth in our credit facilities described below 
if we fail to satisfy these covenants  we could be prohibited from borrowing for our working capital needs and issuing letters of credit  which would hinder our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at planned rates 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or if we are unable to borrow or issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  we would need to seek additional financing  if available  in order to operate our business 
we may consider additional alternatives to further improve our capital structure by increasing our cash balances and or reducing or refinancing a portion of the remaining balance on our term loan 
these alternatives include various strategic initiatives and potential asset sales as well as potential public or private equity or debt financings 
in light of current market conditions  we are not optimistic about the sale of any assets in the near term 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders could be diluted 
we can give no assurances that we will be able to sell any of our assets or to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
however  in light of our current operations and outlook as of the date hereof  and despite the current conditions in the overall economy  and the credit and capital markets  we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements in the near term 
in addition  our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors described in part i

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk changes in commodity prices and interest rates are our primary sources of market risk 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations 
our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices  which depend on many factors  including demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the economy  worldwide production levels  worldwide inventory levels  and governmental regulatory initiatives 
our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations 
in order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility  we have generally applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level 
in the past  circumstances have occurred  such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level 
we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances 
we maintain inventories of crude oil  other feedstocks and blendstocks  and refined products  the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic conditions  regional and global inventory levels  and seasonal conditions 
as of december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   aggregated lifo costs exceeded the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories by million 
as of december   current cost exceeded the carrying value of aggregated lifo costs by million  net of a non cash inventory write down of million to value our yorktown inventories to net realizable market values 
we refer to this excess as our lifo reserve 
in accordance with fasc  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all commodity futures contracts  price swaps  and options are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations as gain loss from derivative activities 
we selectively utilize commodity derivatives to manage our price exposure to inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes 
the commodity derivative instruments may take the form of futures contracts  price swaps  or options and are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for these instruments for financial accounting purposes 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are reflected in gain loss from derivative activities at the end of each period 
for the year ended december   we had million in net losses settled or accounted for using mark to market accounting 
for the year ended december   we had million in net gains settled or accounted for using mark to market accounting 
at december   we had open commodity derivative instruments consisting of crude oil futures and finished product price swaps on a net  barrels to protect the value of certain crude oil  finished product  and blendstock inventories for the first quarter of these open instruments had total unrealized net losses at december   of approximately million 
at december   we had open commodity derivative instruments consisting of finished product price swaps on a net  barrels to protect the value of certain gasoline blendstock inventories for the first quarter in we did not record an unrealized gain or loss on these open positions since the fair value equaled the trade price on these swaps at december  at december   we had open commodity derivative instruments consisting of price swaps on  barrels of crude oil and refined products  primarily to protect the value of certain crude oil inventories and to fix margins on refined product sales for the first and second quarter in these open instruments had total unrealized net losses at december   of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated and accounted for as hedges 
interest rate risk as of december   million of our outstanding debt  excluding unamortized discount  was at floating interest rates based on libor and prime rates 
an increase in these base rates of would increase our interest expense by million per year
