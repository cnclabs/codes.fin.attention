item a 
risk factors reliance on single product line 
our accelerated reader software accounts for approximately of our orders 
in addition  services related to accelerated reader account for approximately of our orders 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader or related services would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in texas and california  each of which accounted for approximately of our net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district or districts controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing our products and services  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators  and their other suppliers  which are heavily dependent on federal  state  and local government funding 
in addition  the school appropriations process is often slow  unpredictable and subject to many factors outside of our control 
budget cuts  curtailments  delays  changes in leadership  shifts in priorities or general reductions in funding could reduce or delay our revenues 
funding difficulties experienced by schools  which have been exacerbated by the current economic downturn and state budget deficits  could also slow or reduce purchases  which in turn could materially harm our business 
our business may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding  resulting from changes in legislation  both at the federal and state levels  changes in the state procurement process  changes in government leadership  emergence of other priorities and changes in the condition of the local  state or us economy 
moreover  future reductions in federal funding and the state and local tax bases could create an unfavorable environment  leading to budget shortfalls resulting in a decrease in educational funding 
any decreased funding for schools may harm our recurring and new business materially if our customers are not able to find and obtain alternative sources of funding 
alignment with government initiatives 
if our products and services are not aligned with government sponsored education initiatives  or such initiatives do not endorse  or do not complement  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products and services  demand for our products and services could decline 
philosophical opposition to our products and services may reduce demand for our products and services and harm our reputation 
our products support all teaching methods and curricula by focusing on continuous feedback  increased student practice of essential skills  and demonstrated product effectiveness through measurable results 
certain educators  academics  politicians  and theorists  however  advocate philosophies of instruction that can lead them to oppose certain educational products or services 
these philosophies can include  but are not limited to  opposition to standardized testing or over reliance on the same  opposition to computers or motivational techniques and narrow focus on particular types of direct instruction 
such philosophical opposition to our products and services may result in the spread of negative views toward our product and services through traditional media  social networking  and the internet  which could result in reduced demand for our products and services 
customer perception of products and services 
our customers perception of our products and services is dependent upon the achievement of positive results in customer schools 
we provide our customers with implementation assistance  telephone support  professional development  and offer certification to schools and classrooms that employ best practices 
if customers do not achieve positive results with our products and services  or do not receive the level of support that they expect  the reputation of our company and our products and services may suffer  which could result in a decline in our revenues 
dependence on continued product development 
the educational technology and services markets in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions  and sudden technological change 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including our ability to enhance our existing products  develop and successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion  and respond quickly and cost effectively to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  hardware platforms  programming languages  alternative delivery systems  the internet and other uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that new products will be as well received as our established products  particularly since they may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
we attempt to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of our products 
our adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete or that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain our competitive position 
success of product strategy 
our product strategy is to convert our customer base from perpetually licensed  locally installed versions of our products to subscription based versions of our products which are delivered over the internet 
if we are unsuccessful in the execution of this strategy  we will incur significant additional costs and may lose customers  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
technology which we are dependent upon may not continue to be available 
licensed technology may be embedded in our products  or be used to deliver products and services to our customers 
such technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or even at all 
additionally  third parties may claim that these technologies infringe upon or violate third party proprietary rights 
these types of claims  regardless of the outcome  may be costly to defend and may divert management s efforts and resources 
we use the internet extensively  and federal or state governments may adopt laws that could expose us to substantial liability or taxation in connection with these activities 
as a result of increasing usage of the internet  federal and state governments may adopt additional laws regarding commercial online services  the internet  user privacy  intellectual property rights  content  and taxation of online communications 
laws directly applicable to online commerce or internet communications are becoming more prevalent and could expose us to substantial liability 
furthermore  various proposals at the federal  state  and local levels could impose additional taxes on internet sales 
new laws and additional taxes may decrease internet use or increase the costs thereof  and adversely affect the success of our online business 
we could experience system failures  software errors or capacity constraints  any of which would cause interruptions in the delivery of electronic products and services to customers and may cause us to lose customers 
any significant delays  disruptions  or failures in the systems  or errors in the software  that we use for the technology based component of our products  as well as for internal operations  could harm our business materially 
we have occasionally suffered computer and telecommunication outages or related problems in the past 
the growth of our customer base could strain our systems in the future and magnify the consequences of any computer and telecommunications problems that we may experience 
many of the systems that we use to deliver our services to customers are located in a single facility 
although we have a disaster recovery plan  it is reasonably likely that a disaster at our main data center would result in a significant disruption of services we provide to our customers 
in addition  our products could be affected by failures associated with third party providers or by failures of third party technology used in our products  and we may have no control over remedying these failures 
any failures or problems with our systems or software could force us to incur significant costs to remedy the failure or problem  decrease customer demand for our products  tarnish our reputation or harm our business materially 
our systems will face security risks that could compromise the privacy of our customers 
our systems and websites face risks such as unauthorized access attempts by hackers  denial of service attacks  computer viruses and other disruptive problems 
although we have extensive security safeguards in place  no system can be completely safe from malicious attacks 
security breaches or problems could lead to misappropriation of our customers information  our websites  our intellectual property and other rights  as well as disruption in the use of our systems and websites 
any security breach related to our systems could tarnish our reputation and expose us to damages and litigation 
we also may incur significant costs to maintain our security precautions or to correct problems caused by security breaches 
these disruptions and interruptions could harm our business materially 
if either our corporate headquarters or distribution center are damaged or destroyed  we could experience significant disruption of our business 
our corporate headquarters  data center and the majority of our sales  marketing  and administrative operations are located in a single facility in wisconsin 
we store and distribute the majority of our hardware and printed materials in another facility in wisconsin 
in the event that either of these facilities are damaged or destroyed  our business would experience substantial disruption and there would be delays in the recovery of our data center  difficulties in providing services to our customers  the inability to take new orders for a period of time  and delays in shipping hardware and printed products to our customers 
our customers often make purchasing decisions very close to the beginning of the school year  and any delivery delays at that time of the year in particular could cause our customers to turn to competitors for products that they need immediately 
although we maintain adequate property insurance and business interruption insurance  the loss of customers could have a long term  detrimental impact on our reputation and business 
reliance on statistical studies to demonstrate effectiveness of our products and services 
we rely on statistical studies to demonstrate that our products and related services improve student achievement 
we believe that these studies accurately reflect the performance of our products 
these studies  however  involve the following risks i the sample sizes used in our studies may yield results that are not representative of the general population of students who use our products  ii the methods used to gather the information upon which these studies are based depend on cooperation from students and other participants  and inaccurate or incomplete responses could distort results  iii schools studying the effectiveness of our products may apply different methodologies and data collection techniques  making results difficult to aggregate and compare  iv we facilitate the collection and analysis of data for some of these studies  and v we hire researchers to aggregate and present the results of some of these studies and  in some cases  to conduct the studies 
there is growing demand from the no child left behind act and other sources for research and studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of educational programs and products 
our selling and marketing efforts  as well as our reputation  could be adversely impacted if the public  including our existing and potential customers  is not convinced that the product effectiveness is supported by the studies 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard certain of our technologies as proprietary and rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we also employ serialization techniques to prevent unauthorized installation of our software products and related content 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation or infringement 
in addition  while we do not believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such assertions can be material  regardless of whether an assertion is validated 
the software publishing industry has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that our software products and the content will not experience unauthorized reproduction and distribution  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may not be successful in selling our products and services through new sales and distribution channels or into new markets  which may limit our growth 
our selling and marketing strategy includes the development of new sales and distribution channels 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering new markets and developing new sales and distribution channels 
risks of international expansion 
a component of our growth strategy is the expansion of our operations in international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of our approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
highly competitive industry 
the educational technology and professional development markets in which we operate are very competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other companies offering educational software products  computing devices  interactive response systems  professional development  and technology consulting services to schools 
education continues to emerge as a major global industry and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers  educational publishers  and consulting firms  may enter or increase their focus on the schools market  resulting in greater competition for us 
in addition  we compete against more traditional methods of education  training  and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
as we enter into new markets  existing competitors could increase the barriers to entry by driving prices lower or making modifications to enhance their products 
success in selling our established products and services may cause competitors to focus on us in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to market our products successfully or compete effectively in the educational marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management 
we do not have employment agreements with these individuals and have no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of our products and to attract and retain qualified employees trained in computer technology  sales  marketing  finance  and other disciplines to enhance our product offerings and broaden our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
the transition to subscription based products has increased the seasonality of customer ordering patterns 
compared to orders for non subscription based offerings  customer orders of our subscription based offerings tend to more closely follow school budgeting cycles  resulting in a more seasonal order pattern weighted to the second and  even more so  third calendar quarters 
our overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of software  hardware  and service sales 
we realize higher margins on our software product sales than our hardware and service sales 
some of our revenues tend to be seasonal due to annual school budget cycles  customer preferences as to when products and services are delivered and the timing of our larger professional development events  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
in addition  our quarterly results can also be affected by delays in the development and or shipment of new products  the closing of large contract sales  such as those to school districts  changes in educational funding which can have a significant effect on quarterly results because customers may hold back orders in anticipation of funding or spend funds to meet defined funding deadlines  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for a period of time  charges related to acquisitions and divestitures  including related expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of intangible assets  asset impairments and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired tangible assets  intangible assets  goodwill  capitalized software development costs and similar items  supply chain issues such as manufacturing problems  delivery delays  component shortages  strikes or quality issues  expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives  and seasonal variability of product support costs 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations and or new products by us and our competitors  earnings releases and other announcements by us and our competitors  expectations regarding government funding levels for education  market conditions in the industry  announcements by us of significant acquisitions and or divestitures  and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if we fail to meet our forecasts or the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of our results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of our common stock 
war  acts of war and terrorism 
delays and reductions in purchases of our products and services may occur as a result of war  acts of war and terrorism  and the related impacts  including a reduction of funds available to our customers to purchase our products and services and disruptions in our ability to develop  produce and distribute products and services to our customers 
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of february   our principal shareholders  judith paul and terrance paul  our chairman and chief executive officer respectively  and co founders of the company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these principal shareholders have the ability to control and direct our business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of february   approximately million shares of our common stock were held by affiliates and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  we have filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan espp  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
we did not offer the espp to our employees in  or and have no intention of offering it in cash dividends 
in each of the four quarters of  we paid a cash dividend of per share 
our dividend policy may be affected by  among other things  our views on potential future capital requirements  including those related to research and development  creation and expansion of sales distribution channels  acquisitions  legal risks and stock repurchases 
our dividend policy may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts 
a change in our dividend policy could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by laws provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt 
divestitures 
from time to time  we may  for any number of reasons  determine it is in our best interests and in the interests of our shareholders to discontinue or dispose of a business or product line 
divestitures involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  and unanticipated costs  and liabilities 
if we are unable to manage the divestiture process successfully or if we are incorrect in our assumptions regarding the costs associated with a disposition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we engage in acquisitions  we may not realize the expected benefits of owning the acquired businesses and our business could be adversely affected due to a variety of operational and financial risks 
we evaluate strategic opportunities from time to time  including acquisitions 
acquisitions involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others the failure to integrate personnel  technology  research and development  marketing and sales operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  the potential loss of the acquired company s customers  as well as our own  and unanticipated costs and liabilities 
integration processes require significant time and resources  and we may not be able to manage the process successfully 
if customers of the acquired company  or our customers  are uncertain about our ability to operate on a combined basis with the acquired company  they could delay or cancel orders for products and services 
moreover  we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction 
if we fail to integrate an acquired company or business successfully  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected  including the potential need to record a non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles

our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  computerized hardware products  and related services 
revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  concessions  and bad debts 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of educational software and hardware 
revenue from sales of hardware is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue recognition from sales of our software depends on whether the software is licensed on a perpetual basis or as a subscription 
we recognize revenue from perpetually licensed software upon delivery to customers 
subscription based software sales are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
service revenue is derived primarily from i product support services  ii professional development and product training seminars and conferences  iii application hosting  iv technical services  v consulting  and vi other remote services 
product support services included with sales of perpetually licensed software have a duration of months or less and the associated revenue is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from professional development and product training seminars and conferences is recognized when the seminar or conference is held 
revenue from other product support services and application hosting is initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  typically months 
revenue from technical services  consulting and other remote services is recognized as the services are performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
deferred revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and services not yet performed  ii advance invoicing on contracts and iii that portion of product support agreements and subscription based product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
we expect that future changes in our products will likely result in the requirement to apply the service revenue recognition rules to subscription sales of our software when such software is hosted by us 
the timing of this change is currently uncertain and will depend on  among other things i how we license and price our products  ii what features are available in our products  and iii whether our customers run our products at their own site as opposed to being hosting at our site 
under the service revenue recognition rules  upfront charges are recognized as revenue beyond the initial contractual period if the relationship with the customer is expected to extend beyond the initial term and the customer continues to benefit from the payment of the up front fee eg  if subsequent renewals are priced at a bargain to the initial up front fee 
the most significant effect this could have on our financial statements is the deferral of upfront charges  for items such as installation and data conversion  which are currently recognized as revenue when the service is completed 
this could have the effect of shifting revenue to future periods and reducing reported earnings in periods when our deferred revenue balances are increasing 
any such change would not affect our cash flow 
it is our practice to announce new products prior to when the products are ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in fluctuations in backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for seminars and conferences are generally received from customers in advance of the events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive solution consisting of products and services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have higher revenue and higher revenue growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of our software and hardware products and the delivery of services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as our neo laptops  optical mark card scanners  know response systems  educational products  training materials  teacher and student guides  manuals  trade books  audio books  and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs and v other overhead costs 
we realize higher gross profit margins on our software sales than on our hardware and service sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales  beginning when the product is available for general release  using the straight line method over their estimated economic life  which is generally estimated to be months 
results of operations consolidated our results of operations can be affected by many factors including the general economic environment  state and federal government budgetary decisions  and the length and complexity of the sales cycle for school districts 
national trends  federal and state legislation  department of education administrative policies  and the way the foregoing align with our products and services can also impact our business 
we monitor several important issues  which are significant to the evaluation of our financial condition  operating results  business challenges  and strategic opportunities 
among the more important of these issues are i our success and trends in maintaining and expanding our customer base  particularly with respect to our accelerated reader software  which accounts for approximately of our orders 
in addition  services related to accelerated reader account for approximately of our orders  ii the general state of k educational funding in the united states  and iii the state of k funding in certain large states  particularly california  texas and florida  which together make up about one third of our total orders 
a key part of our business strategy for maintaining and expanding our customer base and the related revenues is to transition our traditional perpetual license based customers to our newer subscription based software products 
our subscription based products offer enhanced features  which provide greater value to our customers  thereby contributing to increased customer satisfaction 
our most popular subscription based products  the enterprise versions  include much greater access to product content 
the subscription based products are offered with a hosting option  which makes implementation of our software much easier and greatly reduces the costs both to our customers to implement and to us to develop and support the software 
customers who transition to our accelerated reader enterprise subscription based product from our perpetual license products have increased their average annual spending by over  per school 
although this amount of incremental revenue could change due to customer mix and other factors including additional purchases of products and services  we expect that we will continue to see incremental revenue as our perpetual license customers transition to accelerated reader enterprise 
we have also experienced an annual per customer revenue increase for our other subscription based products  but the increase has been most significant with our accelerated reader enterprise product 
we track active usage of both our subscription and perpetual products via a variety of measures including active subscriptions  recent customer support requests  recent purchases of additional content  and recent participation in training or professional development events 
we continuously refine the criteria used to develop this metric in order to provide what we believe is the most useful information for managing and understanding our active customer base 
the most current methodology is applied to develop any historical comparisons so that any presentation is on a consistent basis 
based on these criteria  our approximate worldwide active customer counts for both our perpetual and subscription based licenses at the end of and were as follows product accelerated reader accelerated math star reading or star math we believe the percentage of customers using the subscription based enterprise versions of our reading and math products is an important indicator of the progress of this strategic growth initiative and the magnitude of the growth opportunities still existing with regard to this strategy 
the percentage of customers using reading products is more critical since the accelerated reader is our most significant product and because we have experienced a greater increase in per customer revenues from accelerated reader enterprise compared to our other subscription based products 
at the end of  approximately of our active reading product customers were using the enterprise version as compared to approximately one third at the end of our strategic transition to subscription based software products has affected  and will continue to affect  our results of operations 
we believe that this strategy has the potential to generate more lifetime revenue per customer than selling software under a perpetual license model 
revenues from subscription based software sales are not completely incremental to our results  as customers who make the transition no longer purchase annual support plans for our perpetual license products  and those who purchase our most popular subscription based product  the enterprise version  also no longer purchase add on content 
revenues under the subscription based model are composed of both software and services 
the gross profit margins from subscription based software products are slightly higher than our historical gross profit margins on sales of perpetual license software 
the subscription based software business tends to generate a sales mix somewhat more heavily weighted towards services 
in addition  the services we sell with our subscription based software products tend to have a somewhat higher gross profit margin than those sold with our perpetual license software products 
the transition to subscription based products has increased the seasonality of customer ordering patterns 
compared to orders for non subscription based offerings  customer orders of our subscription based offerings tend to more closely follow school budgeting cycles  resulting in a more seasonal order pattern weighted to the second and  even more so  third calendar quarters 
currently about of our subscriptions have renewal dates in the second quarter and about of our subscriptions have renewal dates in the third quarter 
also  after customers convert to the enterprise version  they no longer order reading quizzes and math libraries  since access to this content is included in their subscription 
the combined effect is that a much greater proportion of a year s orders are expected in the second quarter and to an even greater extent in the third quarter 
historically  our customers have ordered more of this content in the first and fourth quarters 
currently  we receive about of our orders in the second quarter and about in the third quarter 
transitioning our customer base to subscription based software can adversely impact orders for add on reading quizzes and math libraries by causing customers who own our software under perpetual license agreements to delay purchases of add on content if they are contemplating converting to our enterprise version subscription based products 
additionally  our subscription based products are often sold at the school district level 
district level sales tend to be more complex  have a longer sales cycle  and are typically for a larger dollar amount than sales made to individual schools 
orders from district sales are more uneven and more difficult to accurately predict than individual school level sales and  therefore  the timing of large district sales can significantly impact quarterly order levels 
however  as the transition to subscription based products has progressed  we have built substantial balances of deferred subscription revenue 
since this deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period generally twelve months  it reduces the volatility of our reported revenue 
this means that revenues in a given period are not necessarily indicative of the orders placed by our customers for our products and services during a given period 
customer orders for our products increased by approximately million or  in compared to in addition to the above factors  we believe that our third and fourth quarter orders were positively affected by educational funds provided by the american recovery and reinvestment act  which generally first became available to schools during the third quarter a recent survey by the center on budget and policy priorities indicates that nearly all states are still facing significant shortfalls in their fiscal year budget  and the majority of states already anticipate a deficit for fiscal year therefore  it appears likely that once the federal stimulus funds are used up  many states may face budget challenges  which could affect funding for education 
once a recovery in state revenue occurs  it is probable that growth in state spending will lag as the states address needs that have built up in other areas  which require funding 
therefore  it appears that the educational funding environment could be challenging for the next few years 
we have implemented several cost savings initiatives this year including a general hiring freeze  reducing product development expenses related to some of our lower performing product lines  reorganizing our hardware sales group  and implementing other general cost constraints 
these initiatives reduced our annualized expense base by approximately million per year but only yielded net savings of about million in because the initiatives were implemented throughout the year 
during  we expect our operating expenses to be at similar levels to those of the latter half of  offset somewhat by moderate increases in selling and marketing expenses in order to achieve future sales growth and for new business initiatives

liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities were million  compared to million at december  during  our cash flow from operations was million 
as of december   we have a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank  which is available until july  the line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate or a fixed rate for a period of up to days based on libor plus 
the rate is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank available until april   which bears interest at the prime rate less 
as of december   the lines of credit had not been used 
on april   our board of directors authorized a repurchase program  which provides for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares under the stock repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares under the stock repurchase program 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program  nor is there any dollar limit on the program 
we repurchase shares on the open market as well as from employees who elect to surrender restricted shares at the time of vesting to pay their payroll withholding taxes 
repurchased shares will become treasury shares and may be used for equity compensation plans  stock based employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes 
from january  through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of million 
since the original authorization of the repurchase program in  we have repurchased approximately million shares at a cost of million 
depending on our stock valuation  cash availability and other factors  we may repurchase additional shares as a beneficial use of our cash to enhance shareholder value 
in each of the four quarters of  we paid a cash dividend of per share 
in each of the four quarters of  we paid a cash dividend of per share along with a special dividend of per share in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends  subject to capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
our board of directors also considers several additional factors when declaring dividends  including the company s financial statements as of the most recent practicable date  the expected cash costs to deliver the products and services sold and recorded as deferred revenue  the company s ability to provide the products and services underlying the amounts recorded as deferred revenue  the likelihood of recognizing amounts recorded as deferred revenue as net sales based on the company s historical experience and most recent projections  the short time period over which such recognition has historically occurred and is expected to occur  seasonal cash flow  general economic outlook  and other information  opinions  reports and statements prepared and presented by the company s officers and employees about the company s business  operations and financial condition 
we believe our strong cash position coupled with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations including contingent obligations  that would have a material effect on our financial results 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases  primarily for facilities that we occupy in order to carry out our business operations 
we utilize operating leases for some of our facilities to gain flexibility as compared to purchasing facilities outright and to limit our exposure to many of the risks of owning commercial property  particularly with regard to international operations 
these agreements are generally for terms of one to five years 
some of the leases have early termination clauses  but they generally cannot be terminated early for reasons other than breach of the lease agreement 
we terminated the lease on a small office facility in early for which we had a day no penalty option to terminate 
we do not anticipate the early termination of any significant lease agreement in for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to these operating leases 
purchase obligations 
we enter into commitments with certain suppliers to purchase our hardware products  such as neo laptops  accelscan scanners and the know response system 
the majority of these obligations will be satisfied within one year 
tax audit settlements and deposits 
currently we do not anticipate making any significant cash payments related to the settlement of tax audits in or deposits for unsettled audit issues 
estimation of the amounts and timing of payments in periods after are highly uncertain and therefore are not included in the table 
as of december   our approximate contractual obligations for operating leases  tax audit payments and purchase obligations by period due were as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations tax audit related payments purchase obligations total supplemental executive retirement plan 
we have established a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for the provision of retirement benefits to members of senior management 
under the terms of the plan  participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and invest their deferrals in certain mutual funds  which are nearly identical to the investment selections offered to participants in our k retirement plan 
upon a serp participant s retirement or certain other events  we have an obligation to pay the current market value of the participant s account balance 
as of december   we have fully funded the million aggregate contractual obligation for future payments to serp participants 
payouts of our obligations related to the serp are dependent on when participants leave service and how they elect to receive their accrued benefit payments  which can range from a single lump sum payment to a year series of payments 
due to the inherent uncertainties in predicting when the serp obligations will be paid  they are not included in the above table 
the serp is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other obligations 
as of december   we did not hold any long term debt obligations  long term purchase obligations or material capital lease obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a list of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in general  we are required under us gaap to recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for perpetually licensed off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii as seminars are performed for training and professional development services  iii straight line over the term of the support agreement for other software support agreements  iv as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for application hosting  technical and consulting services and v straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products and services 
accordingly  management is required to make judgments as to the fair value of the elements of an arrangement  whether an element of an arrangement is software or a service  whether pricing is fixed and determinable  and whether collectability is reasonably assured 
the accounting rules are complex  sometimes vague  and are subject to interpretation  which exposes us to risk in our revenue recognition practices 
expenses are accounted for using the accrual method of accounting 
they are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements  or recognized as period expenses depending on the requirement of the applicable accounting rule 
the accrual method of accounting requires that we make estimates for expenses not yet fully realized at the time of preparation of our financial statements 
for example  we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns or doubtful accounts to differ from historical experience 
such allowances may require adjustments if future returns or bad debt activity differs from our estimates 
therefore  the need to make estimates exposes us to the risk that the amount of expense reported in any given period may vary significantly from actual results 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we assess the value of our goodwill on at least an annual basis by comparing its fair value with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation analysis performed by management using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made regarding future cash flows 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as overall economic conditions  competitive forces  customer behavior  product acceptance  specific industry factors  and changes in interest rates 
in  we recorded a material impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangibles 
in and  our laptop revenues decreased due in part to difficulties in integrating the selling operations of alphasmart into our overall organization 
early results in were encouraging  but the worsening economic climate resulted in schools and districts becoming very cautious with their spending  causing laptop orders to decline sharply in the fourth quarter of laptops are generally viewed as a more discretionary purchase in times of tight school budgets and curtailed spending 
as we believed the economic problems could be relatively prolonged  we lowered our forecast for orders of laptops and writing software  which resulted in impairment charges in related to the alphasmart acquisition as follows i goodwill of million  ii trademark of million  and iii customer relationships of million 
product warranty obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of hardware warranties at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based on our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in product return rates 
if there were a significant adverse change in product return rates or if other factors used in our estimates vary significantly from actual experience  there may be a need to accrue additional costs in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over their estimated economic life  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate anticipated to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  the estimated amount of certain tax credits  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations  if the actual amount of tax credits varies from our estimates  or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made and could also affect later periods 
we record a liability for uncertain tax positions based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  there is significant inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amendment becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  however  early adoption is permitted 
the pronouncement addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the pronouncement may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
the company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on revenue arrangements for tangible products that include software elements 
the amendment becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  however  early adoption is permitted 
the pronouncement removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance if the products contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
the pronouncement may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
the company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which became effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the new guidance requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of basic earnings per share 
this also requires retroactive restatement of earnings per share for all prior periods presented in the financial statements and footnotes 
adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our basic or diluted earnings per share 
in april  the fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which became effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the new guidance generally requires the use of a consistent useful life for an intangible asset when computing amortization  for the period of expected cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the asset  and for other accounting purposes 
adoption of this amendment did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on business combinations  which became effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
adoption of this amendment did not materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which became effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 
this changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which are recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
this new consolidation method significantly changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders 
adoption of this amendment did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and ii the decrease or increase in the value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer  from upgrades or downgrades in the creditworthiness of the securities issuer  upgrades or downgrades in the creditworthiness of the insurer of the securities  and from changes in general market conditions 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with our corporate investment policy as established by our board of directors 
the goals of the policy are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversification  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions  and tax considerations 
our investment policy permits investments in obligations of the us treasury department and its agencies  money market funds  certificates of deposit  and high quality investment grade corporate and municipal interest bearing obligations 
the policy requires diversification to prevent excess concentration of issuer risk and requires the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels 
the policy precludes investment in equity securities except for the specific purpose of funding the obligations related to our supplemental executive retirement plan see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our investment securities had a market value of approximately million and a carrying value of million 
due to the type and duration of our investments  we do not expect to realize any material gains or losses related to market risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
we use the historical exchange rates published by the oanda corporation for these translations 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the british pound  canadian dollar and the euro 
at this time  foreign exchange rate risk is not significant due to the relative size of our foreign operations and revenues derived from sales in foreign currencies
