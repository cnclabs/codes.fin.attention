revenues for the year ended july  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended june  for the year ended july   revenues in the telecom and advanced photonics solution segments increased by million and million  respectively  compared to the year ended june  the increase in our telecom segment was primarily related to our merger with avanex in april  improvements in market conditions as compared to the calendar year economic downturn  and market share gains across the majority of our product areas 
the increase in our advanced photonics solutions segment was primarily related to including revenues from our july acquisition of the newport laser diode business in our results of operations for the year ended july  for the year ended july   huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues and alcatel lucent accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
for the year ended june   huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues and nortel networks corporation nortel accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials  labor costs and related overhead  including stock based compensation charges  and the costs charged by our contract manufacturers on the products they manufacture for us 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory  including in regards to inventories procured by contract manufacturers on our behalf  the cost of product returns and warranty costs are also included in cost of revenues 
costs and expenses related to our manufacturing resources incurred in connection with the development of new products are included in research and development expense 
our cost of revenues for the year ended july  increased million  or percent  from the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to our merger with avanex in april and the acquisition of the newport laser diode business in july  as well as costs associated with higher volumes of revenue resulting from improved market conditions subsequent to the economic downturn of calendar year  which were partially offset by the efficiencies from merger related synergies and realizing the benefits of previous cost reduction efforts 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin rate increased to percent for the year ended july   compared to percent for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin rate was primarily due to operating leverage from higher revenue volumes  synergies from the merger with avanex  including related cost reductions and the internal sourcing of oclaro components into avanex products  as well as the impact of other cost reduction efforts during fiscal year and earlier 
gross margin rate was also favorably impacted during year ended july  relative to year ended june  due to recognizing the costs associated with million of products shipped to nortel in the year ended june   which revenue was deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research and design activities  including stock based compensation charges related to those employees  costs of design tools and computer hardware  costs related to prototyping and facilities costs for certain research and development focused sites 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development in connection with the merger with avanex in april  the acquisitions of the newport laser diode business in july and xtellus in december  and increased investment in research and development resources  primarily personnel related  as we have the objective of investing in research and development to match the rate of our anticipated revenue growth 
research and development expenses in fiscal year also included an additional one week of expenses due to our fiscal calendar 
the year ended july  was a week year  while the year ended june  was a week year 
personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended june  other costs  including the costs of design tools and facilities related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended june  over the coming year  we intend to increase our research and development expenditures consistent with the rate of our anticipated revenue growth  with a continuing emphasis towards investing in low cost regions where practical 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to employees engaged in sales  general and administrative functions  legal and professional fees  facilities expenses  insurance expenses and certain information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in costs incurred in connection with the merger with avanex in april and the acquisitions of the newport laser diode business in july and xtellus in december  offset in part by synergies related to integrating these operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year also included an additional one week of expenses due to our fiscal calendar 
the year ended july  was a week year  while the year ended june  was a week year 
personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended june  other costs  including legal and professional fees  facilities expenses and other miscellaneous expenses increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended june  amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended july  from million in the year ended june  this million increase was driven by recent acquisitions during the current fiscal year 
specifically  the amortizable base of our intangible assets increased in the year ended july  by million from our newport acquisition  million from our xtellus acquisition and million from an asset purchase 
we expect the amortization of intangible assets to increase to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal years through these future amortization expense amounts do not reflect any additional amortization expense which may occur as a result of our recent acquisition of mintera corporation 

table of contents restructuring  merger and related costs 
for the year ended july  we accrued million in expenses  net of adjustments  for revised estimates related to lease cancellations and commitments and million in additional employee separation costs in connection with cost reduction and restructuring plans implemented in prior years 
during the year ended july   we also initiated a new restructuring plan resulting from our acquisition of the newport laser diode business 
this plan involves the transfer of laser diode manufacturing operations from tucson  arizona to our european manufacturing facilities 
we incurred million in restructuring accruals for employee separation charges under the newport plan 
during the year ended july   we also wrote down million in inventory  net of adjustments  which became impaired through the integration of our wavelength selective switch wss product lines 
during the year ended july   we also recorded million for merger related costs  which include million of professional fees and million in employee retention payments payable in connection with the acquisition of xtellus 
during the second half of fiscal year  we reassessed the fair value of the value protection liability related to our xtellus acquisition determining that the fair value of this liability declined from million at january  to nil at july  this million change in fair value was recognized as a reduction to merger related costs during the year ended july  legal settlement 
in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with a competitor  which resulted in us recording million in legal settlement expenses during the year ended june  of this amount  million represents settlement payments paid to the competitor and million represents legal fees incurred in connection with the litigation and settlement 
legal fees during the year ended june  were partially offset by a million benefit from the settlement of a legal action in connection with our sale of land in swindon  uk to a third party in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the year ended june  we determined  in accordance with asc topic  that the goodwill related to our new focus and avalon reporting units was fully impaired  and we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill impairment 
in conjunction with our review of goodwill  we recorded million for the impairment loss related to certain intangible assets related to our avalon reporting unit in our fiscal year statement of operations 
the impairment charges will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
gain on sale of property and equipment 
during the year ended july   we recorded a net gain of million  primarily related to the sale of certain fixed assets in villebon  france made surplus in connection with the closing of that facility 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended july  decreased by million compared to the year ended june  this decrease primarily resulted from an million decrease in gain from the re measurement of short term receivables and payables for fluctuations in the us dollar relative to our other local functional currencies during the corresponding periods among certain of our wholly owned international subsidiaries and a million decrease in interest income due to lower average interest rates  which was partially offset by a million gain from the bargain purchase of the high power laser diodes business from newport on july  income tax provision benefit 
for the year ended july   our income tax provision of million primarily relates to million in current income taxes related to our operations in italy  china and the united states  which was partially offset by a release of million in our valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize net operating losses in one of our foreign jurisdictions due to current earnings and projections of future profitability 
accordingly  we released million of our valuation allowance against million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year this amount represents the entire remaining deferred tax asset related to the accumulated net operating losses of the foreign jurisdiction 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax attributes in other jurisdictions  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our remaining foreign and domestic deferred tax assets as of july  income loss from discontinued operations 
during the year ended july   we recorded income of million from discontinued operations from the sale of the new focus business

cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended june  included million of stock based compensation charges compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit 
our gross margin rate increased to percent for the year ended june   compared to percent for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin rate was due to improved costs and yields in certain product areas in our telecom segment  including our tunable products  the benefit of previous manufacturing overhead cost reduction efforts being in place for an entire year  and from temporary measures to reduce the costs in our manufacturing sites during the economic downturn

research and development expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to million in cost savings associated with the uk pound sterling weakening relative to the us dollar  of which approximately million was personnel related 
there was a further million reduction in stock based compensation 
these reductions were offset by increased spend on materials used in new product development  increased research and development expenditures of million in our shenzhen  china site and the addition of million in research and development expenses from avanex for the period from april  to june  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily the result of million in cost reductions associated with the uk pound sterling weakening relative to the us dollar  million in lower stock compensation charges  and million in other cost reductions  partially offset by million in expenses from avanex for the period from april  to june  amortization of intangible assets 
during the year ended june   certain of the purchased intangible assets from our prior business acquisitions became fully amortized 
additionally  purchased intangible assets related to our avalon reporting unit were determined to be impaired in the third quarter of fiscal year  and written down to fair value as described above 
collectively  these events reduced our expense for amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended june  by million as compared to the year ended june  at june   there were million in remaining intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges  subject to the amortization provisions of asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the purchase accounting for our merger with avanex on april  did not generate additional intangible assets

from time to time  we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses  such as our merger with avanex  acquisitions of xtellus and mintera  and our exchange of assets agreement with newport  and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates 
any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities  debt  and or cash consideration 
we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition  through either the issuance of equity securities or borrowings 
if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
risk management foreign currency risk as our business is multinational in scope  we are increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the us pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel  the swiss franc and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel  zurich  switzerland and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling  and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of july   we held seventeen foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to may during the year ended july   we recorded a net loss of million in our statement of operations in connection with foreign exchange contracts that expired during that year 
as of july  we recorded an unrealized gain of  to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations at july   by nature of the obligation and amount due over identified periods of time  are set out in the table below operating sublease purchase long term leases income obligations obligations thousands fiscal year thereafter the purchase obligations consist of our total outstanding purchase order commitments as at july  any capital purchases to which we are committed are included in these outstanding purchase orders under standard terms and conditions 
operating leases are future annual commitments under non cancelable operating leases  including rents payable for land and buildings 
off balance sheet arrangements we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however such insurance may not cover any  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
we also have indemnification clauses in various contracts that we enter into in the normal course of business  such as those issued by our bankers in favor of several of our suppliers or indemnification in favor of customers in respect of liabilities they may incur as a result of purchasing our products should such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have not historically paid out any material amounts related to these indemnifications  therefore no accrual has been made for these indemnifications 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent significant events on april   we announced that our board of directors had approved a for reverse split of our common stock  pursuant to previously obtained stockholder authorization 
this reverse stock split  which became effective at pm  eastern time  on april   reduced the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding from approximately million to approximately million and reduced the number of authorized shares of our common stock from million to million 
all share and per share amounts herein are presented on a post reverse split basis 
on may   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
to date  we have used million of the net proceeds for an investment in clariphy and million for our acquisition of mintera 
we may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents on july   we announced the acquisition of mintera corporation  a privately held provider of high performance optical transport sub systems solutions 
we paid million in cash to the former security holders and creditors of mintera 
we also agreed to pay additional revenue based consideration whereby former security holders of mintera are entitled to receive up to million  determined based on a set of sliding scale formulas  to the extent revenue from mintera products is more than million in the twelve months following the acquisition and or more than million in the months following the acquisition 
the post closing consideration  if any  will be payable in cash or  at our option  newly issued shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and stock 
achieving cumulative revenues of million over the next month period and million over the next month period would lead to the maximum million in additional consideration 
we believe this acquisition will broaden our product portfolio for high speed transmission solutions  and will reinforce our position as one of the leading optical communications providers 
as a result of the acquisition  oclaro expects to offer components  modules and sub systems covering all of the major modulation technologies necessary for high performance gb s data transmission in regional  metro  long haul and ultra long haul networks 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from those based on our estimates and judgments or could be materially different if we used different assumptions  estimates or conditions 
in addition  our financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of such estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that the policies described below involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns revenue represents the amounts  excluding sales taxes  derived from the sale of goods and services to third party customers during a given period 
our revenue recognition policy follows asc topic  revenue recognition 
specifically  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title has transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
for certain sales  we are required to determine  in particular  whether the delivery has occurred  whether items will be returned and whether we will be paid under normal commercial terms 
for certain products sold to customers  we specify delivery terms in the agreement under which the sale was made and assess each shipment against those terms  and only recognize revenue when we are certain that the delivery terms have been met 
for shipments to new customers and evaluation units  including initial shipments of new products  where the customer has the right of return through the end of an 
table of contents evaluation period  we recognize revenue on these shipments at the end of the evaluation period  if not returned  and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates for sales returns are based on historical sales return rates  other known factors and our return policy 
before accepting a new customer  we review publicly available information and credit rating databases to provide ourselves with reasonable assurance that the new customer will pay all outstanding amounts in accordance with our standard terms 
for existing customers  we monitor historic payment patterns to assess whether we can expect payment in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement under which the sale was made 
we recognize revenues from financially distressed customers when collectability becomes reasonably assured  assuming all other above criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in fiscal year we issued billings of million for products that were shipped to nortel  but for which payment was not received prior to nortel s bankruptcy filing on january  as a result  the corresponding revenue was deferred  and therefore was not recognized as revenues or accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at the time of such billings  as we determined that such amounts were not reasonably assured of collectability in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
as of july   we had contractual receivables from nortel totaling million which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that collectability becomes reasonably assured for these deferred billings in future periods  our future results of operations will benefit from the recognition of these amounts 
inventory valuation in general  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost to acquire or manufacture our products or market value  less write offs of inventory we believe could prove to be unsaleable 
manufacturing costs include the cost of the components purchased to produce our products and related labor and overhead 
we review our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if it is saleable 
products may be unsaleable because they are technically obsolete due to substitute products  specification changes or excess inventory relative to customer forecasts 
we currently reduce the cost basis for inventory using methods that take these factors into account 
if we find that the cost of inventory is greater than the current market price  we will write the inventory down to the estimated selling price  less the cost to complete and sell the product 
business combinations through june   we accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase accounting method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this method  we allocated the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated relative fair values at the acquisition date  with any excess allocated to goodwill defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets  therefore  affected the amount of goodwill that we recorded 
these judgments include estimating the useful lives over which the fair values are amortized to expense 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  we estimate useful lives by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and specific factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  patents  supply agreements  capitalized licenses and customer contracts 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from three to six years and  in the case of one specific customer contract  fifteen years 
our acquisitions consummated after june   including the acquisition of the high power laser diodes business from newport on july  and our acquisition of xtellus on december   were accounted for 
table of contents pursuant to asc topic  business combinations 
under asc topic  there are significant differences as compared to sfas no 
in determining the purchase price of an acquired entity  including under asc topic  the purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred on the date of the business combination 
previously  the value of equity based consideration transferred was determined based on the fair value at the time of announcement of the business combination 
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are recorded at the acquisition date fair value 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is recognized for any excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a bargain purchase gain results if the fair value of the purchase price is less than the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we recorded a million bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of newport s high power laser diodes business during fiscal year management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant 
for instance  the estimated fair value of our common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of xtellus was determined using the closing price of per share as of the acquisition date  december   adjusted by a discount rate to reflect the lack of marketability due to the shares being unregistered and subject to restrictions on transfer under rule of the securities act 
in addition  the estimated fair value of the value protection guarantee issued in connection with the xtellus acquisition was determined by using management estimates of future operating results and a monte carlo simulation model to determine the likelihood of achieving certain market conditions 
our preliminary estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period for a business combination  which may be up to one year  we may record adjustments to the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
after the conclusion of the measurement period or our final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  subsequent adjustments affecting earnings are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of adopting the revised accounting standards provided for by asc topic as of the beginning of our fiscal year  certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions consummated after june   including the direct transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred previously  direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price  the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination previously  restructuring and exit costs directly resulting from the business combination were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation  and the fair value of in process research and development is recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed  at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life  or abandoned  at which time the intangible asset is expensed previously  in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under asc topic  goodwill is tested annually for impairment  in our case during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if an event or circumstance suggests impairment has occurred 
in addition  we review identifiable intangibles  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes to the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly below carrying value before the end of its estimated useful life 

table of contents asc topic requires that the first phase of testing goodwill for impairment be based on a reporting unit s fair value  which is generally determined through market prices 
in certain cases  due to the absence of market prices for a particular element of our business  and as permitted by asc topic  we have elected to base our testing on discounted future expected cash flows 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the forecasted cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we perform and present to our board of directors 
in this process  each reporting unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three to seven years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates used for determining discounted future cash flows are generally based on our weighted average cost of capital and are then adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three to seven year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used in our models are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industry in which we operate 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable  various economic factors could cause the results of our goodwill testing to vary significantly 
during the fiscal year ended june   we observed indicators of potential impairment of our goodwill  including the impact of the then current general economic downturn  our future prospects and the continued decline of our market capitalization  which caused us to conduct a goodwill impairment analysis 
specifically  indicators emerged within our new focus reporting unit  which includes the technology acquired in the march acquisition of oclaro photonics  inc and is in our advanced photonics solutions segment  and one other reporting unit in the advanced photonics solutions segment that includes the technology acquired in the march acquisition of avalon photonics ag the avalon reporting unit 
these indicators led us to conclude that an asc topic impairment test was required to be performed for goodwill related to these reporting units 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined  in our first step goodwill impairment analysis  that the goodwill related to our new focus and avalon reporting units were in fact impaired 
we completed our full evaluation of the second step impairment analysis  which indicated that the goodwill was fully impaired 
we recorded million for impairment losses in our statement of operations for the year ended june  the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
in conjunction with our full evaluation of the second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of the intangible assets of these two reporting units in accordance with asc topic  property  plant and equipment 
based on this testing  we determined that the intangibles of our new focus reporting unit and our avalon reporting units were impaired 
we recorded million for the impairment loss related to these intangibles  net of million associated with the discontinued operations of the new focus business  in our statements of operations for the year ended june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended july   we performed our annual asc topic impairment assessment of our goodwill and a separate impairment assessment of our other intangible assets  concluding that no impairment existed at the assessment dates 
accounting for share based payments asc topic  compensation stock compensation  requires companies to recognize in their statement of operations all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  based on their fair values on the grant dates 
the application of asc topic involves significant amounts of judgment in the determination of inputs into the black scholes merton valuation model which we use to determine the fair value of share based awards 
these inputs are based upon highly subjective assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates and the expected life of the options 
judgment is also required in estimating the number 
table of contents of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited during any given period 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the years ended july   june  and june   we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively  in our results from continuing operations 
see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information 
income taxes we provide for income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic requires an asset and liability based approach of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred income tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize net operating losses in one of our foreign jurisdictions due to current earnings and projections of future profitability 
accordingly  we released million of our valuation allowance against million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year this amount represents the entire remaining deferred tax asset related to the accumulated net operating losses of the foreign jurisdiction 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax attributes in other jurisdictions  we have recorded full a valuation allowance against our remaining foreign and domestic deferred tax assets as of july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we finance our operations through a mixture of issuances of equity securities  finance leases  working capital and by drawing on the amended credit agreement 
our only exposure to interest rate fluctuations is on our cash deposits and for amounts borrowed under the amended credit agreement 
at july  there was no amount outstanding under the amended credit agreement 
as of july   we had million in an outstanding standby letter of credit with a vendor secured under this credit agreement 
we monitor our interest rate risk on cash balances primarily through cash flow forecasting 
cash that is surplus to immediate requirements is invested in short term deposits with banks accessible with one day s notice and invested in overnight money market accounts 
we believe our current interest rate risk is immaterial 
foreign currency as our business has grown and become multinational in scope  we have become increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
despite our change in domicile from the united kingdom to the united states in  and our movement of certain functions  including assembly and test operations  from the united kingdom to china  in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the uk pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses  could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel  the swiss franc and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel  zurich  switzerland and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
as of july   our uk subsidiary had million  net  in us dollar denominated operating intercompany payables and million in us dollar denominated accounts receivable related to sales to external customers 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the us pound sterling would 
table of contents lead to a profit of million us dollar strengthening  or loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these receivables  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our consolidated statement of operations 
hedging program we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the chinese yuan  korean won  israeli shekel  swiss franc or the euro  but we may in the future if conditions warrant 
we also do not currently hedge our exposure related to our us dollar denominated intercompany payables and receivables 
we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of july   we held seventeen foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to may and we have recorded an unrealized gain of  to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the dollar between july  and the maturity dates of the put and call instruments underlying these contracts would lead to a profit of million us dollar weakening or loss of million us dollar strengthening on our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  should they be held to maturity
