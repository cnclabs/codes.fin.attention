us business transformation measures the us business transformation measures in and included expansion of our us refranchising  a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term growth strategy  g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases 
we do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 
in the years ended december  and december   we recorded a pre tax gain of million and a pre tax loss of million from refranchising in the us  respectively 
in  we currently expect to refranchise restaurants in the us the impact of this refranchising on our results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores 
additionally  to the extent we offer to sell a store or group of stores at a loss  such loss is recorded at the date we make such offer 
gains upon refranchising  however  are not recorded until we consummate the sale 
this timing difference can create quarterly or annual earnings volatility as decisions are made to refranchise a portfolio of stores 
as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and a w us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding  we recorded a non cash charge of million  which resulted in no related income tax benefit  in the fourth quarter of to write off goodwill associated with these businesses 
in connection with our g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pre tax charges of million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we realized a million decline in our us g a expenses in the year ended december  driven by the us productivity initiatives and realignment of resources measures we took in and additionally  the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of million  pre tax  in the year ended december  related to investments in our us brands 
these investments reflect our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai  china on may  we acquired an additional ownership in the entity that operates more than kfcs in shanghai  china for million  increasing our ownership to 
this entity has historically been accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting 
concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition 
as required by gaap  we remeasured our previously held ownership  which had a recorded value of million at the date of acquisition  in the entity at fair value and recognized a gain of million accordingly 
this gain  which resulted in no related income tax expense  was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
under the equity method of accounting  we previously reported our share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
subsequent to the date of the acquisition  we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting 
net income attributable to our partner s ownership percentage is recorded as net income noncontrolling interest within our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december  the consolidation of this entity increased company sales by million and decreased franchise and license fees and income by million 
the consolidation of this entity positively impacted operating profit by million in the impact on net income yum brands  inc was not significant to the year ended december  prior to lapping the acquisition of this entity during the second quarter of  we expect the impact of this transaction to increase the china division s company sales by approximately million  decrease franchise and license fees and income by approximately million and provide a modest increase to operating profit during the first half of refranchising of an international equity market in the third quarter of we recognized a million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market 
this loss  which resulted in no related income tax benefit  was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
this market was refranchised on january  we are currently evaluating what amount of the million in goodwill associated with kfc taiwan should be written off in the first quarter of as a result of this refranchising

china division restaurant margin increased percentage points and declined percentage points in and  respectively 
the improvement was largely driven by commodity deflation of million offsetting company same store sales declines

consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in beijing  china in  we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the kfcs in beijing  china 
our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises 
we historically did not consolidate this entity  instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting  due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business 
concurrent with a decision that we made on january  regarding top management of the entity  we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with gaap  we began consolidating this entity on that date 
like our other unconsolidated affiliates  the accounting for this entity prior to resulted in royalties being reflected as franchise and license fees and our share of the entity s net income being reflected in other income expense 
subsequent to the date of consolidation  we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting 
net income attributable to our partner s ownership percentage is recorded as net income noncontrolling interest within our consolidated statement of income 
for the year ended december  the consolidation of this entity increased the china division s company sales by approximately million and decreased franchise and license fees and income by approximately million 
the consolidation of this entity positively impacted operating profit by approximately million in the positive impact on operating profit was offset by net income noncontrolling interest of million and a higher income tax provision such that there was no impact on net income yum brands  inc for the year ended december  the consolidated statement of income was impacted by similar amounts for the year ended december  mexico value added tax vat exemption on october   mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments 
beginning on january   we were required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit 
as a result of this new legislation  our international division s company sales and restaurant profit for the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by approximately million and million  respectively 
the international division s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately and percentage points  respectively  for the year ended december  the impact versus was not significant to our international division s results of operations 
tax legislation mainland china on march   the national people s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january  upon enactment  which occurred in the china division s second fiscal quarter  the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities  including our unconsolidated affiliates  were adjusted 
these income tax rate changes positively impacted our and net income yum brands  inc by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted 
the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december  were not significant 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below  down from its current level of 
consistent with this strategy   and company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of g a declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year

as licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units  we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information 
b in our fiscal quarter ended march   we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan 
while we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both kfcs and pizza huts in japan  it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate

similarly  a new multibrand restaurant  while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands  results in just one additional unit count

benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations positively impacted the effective tax rate as a result of lapping expenses associated with the distribution of an intercompany dividend and adjustments to our deferred tax balances that resulted from the mexico tax law change  as further discussed below  as well as a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the us these benefits were partially offset in by the gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan and expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings 
we also recognized deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by certain tax planning strategies implemented in included in foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations percentage point impact 
however  we provided a full valuation allowance on these assets as we do not believe it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 
our effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals 
in december  the company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations  distributed a million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns 
in  benefits associated with our foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by million of expense associated with the million intercompany dividend and approximately million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns  including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets 
adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves  including interest thereon  established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure 
consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million compared to  million in the decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions  partially offset by higher net income 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was  million compared to  million in the decrease was primarily driven by higher interest payments and pension contributions 
net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in little sheep  as discussed in note  lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property  plant and equipment  partially offset by lower capital spending 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the increase was driven by higher capital spending in and the lapping of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the japan unconsolidated affiliate in  partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants 
in december  we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 
the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close 
thus  consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period  the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of million was recorded in the first quarter of however  the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december and were thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million versus  million in the decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases  partially offset by net payments on debt 
in  net cash used in financing activities was  million versus million in the increase was driven by lower net borrowings  higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments in consolidated financial condition the acquisition of additional ownership in  and consolidation of  a former unconsolidated affiliate that operates the kfcs in shanghai  china during impacted our consolidated balance sheet at december  see note for a discussion of this transaction and a summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition and consolidation 
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last eight fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
however  unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns  we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
additionally  as of december  we had approximately billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in  primarily related to a domestic facility 
our china division and yri represent more than of the company s operating profit and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development 
to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending  including share repurchases  dividends and debt repayments  we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner 
as a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of non cash undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries is considered indefinitely reinvested as of december  if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 
we are currently managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from standard poor s rating services bbb and moody s investors service baa 
as a commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating we improved our capital structure by extending our scheduled debt maturities while reducing our debt outstanding during additionally  we funded million of our unfunded pension obligation and did not repurchase shares of our common stock 
subsequent to year end  we have resumed repurchasing shares of our common stock 
however we believe we can do so while maintaining a capital structure that allows us to remain an investment grade borrower 
while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating  a downgrade would increase the company s current borrowing costs and could impact the company s ability to access the credit markets if necessary 
based on the amount and composition of our debt at december   which included a minimal amount outstanding under our credit facilities  our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in our businesses  including approximately million in the us  million for the international division and million for the china division 
for  we estimate capital spending will be approximately billion 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of of net income 
the company did not repurchase shares of our common stock during as of december   we have million excluding applicable transaction fees available for future repurchases under a share repurchase authorization that expires in september borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in november and includes participating banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or is determined by an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
we also have a million  syndicated revolving credit facility the international credit facility  or icf which matures in november and includes banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
there was available credit of million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum 
these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
given the company s balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december  with a considerable amount of cushion 
the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and stated interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes  reflecting the events described below  were billion at december  during the second quarter of we repurchased senior unsecured notes due july  with an aggregate principal amount of million 
in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are due in september and million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are due in september we used the proceeds from our issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay a variable rate senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million that was scheduled to mature in and to make discretionary payments to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of our senior unsecured notes  credit facility  and icf all contain cross default provisions  whereby a default under any of these agreements constitutes a default under each of the other agreements 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other d total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the libor forward yield curve 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to nearly  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
d other consists of pension plan funding obligations  the current portion of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and projected payments for deferred compensation 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees  the most significant of which are in the us and us the most significant of these plans  the yum retirement plan the plan  is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred 
our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan s funded status 
at december   the plan was in a net underfunded position of million 
based on the current funding status of the plan  we will not be required to make minimum contributions in investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption 
future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded position of million at our measurement date 
we have committed to making discretionary funding contributions of million to one of these plans in and this amount is included in our contractual obligations table above 
our post retirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made post retirement benefit payments of million in and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table 
see note for further details about our pension and post retirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs at december  we have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately million in support of the franchisee loan program 
one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee 
the other letter of credit could be used  in certain circumstances  to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program 
the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were million at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately million and million of debt outstanding as of december  and december   respectively 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  separate disclosures are required for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the company 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  in june  the fasb issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets  requiring more information about transfers of financial assets  eliminating the qualifying special purpose entity concept  changing the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requiring additional disclosures 
the fasb also issued guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  that modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
the adoption of this guidance may require the company to consolidate an entity that provides loans used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs 
if consolidation of this entity is required  the company s long term debt will increase by approximately million with a corresponding increase to receivables 
see note for additional information regarding this franchisee loan program 
this guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november   our fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets of restaurants primarily pp e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating and have not been offered for refranchise semi annually for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant s forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
for restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable  we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value 
key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the after tax cash flows and discount rate 
the after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise the restaurants as a group 
these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale 
expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer  if available  or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows for the restaurant or group of restaurants 
the after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets 
historically  these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets 
the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
these definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted after tax cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property  plant and equipment 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
the assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit 
we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
except for the ljs a w us and pizza hut south korea reporting units discussed below  the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value as of the goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
yum recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million for our ljs a w us and pizza hut south korea reporting units  respectively  as the carrying value of these reporting units exceeded their fair values 
the fair value of the ljs a w us reporting unit was based on our discounted expected after tax cash flows from the future royalty stream  net of g a  expected to be earned from the underlying franchise agreements 
these cash flows incorporated a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs a w us reporting unit  which were due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term us growth strategy 
the fair value of the pizza hut south korea reporting unit was based on the discounted expected after tax future cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties for this reporting unit 
our expectations of after tax cash flows for this business were negatively impacted by recent profit declines for this reporting unit 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables guarantees franchise and license receivable balances include royalties  initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services 
our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december  as such  we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december  we have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants  facilitating franchisee development and equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification  such as renewals  when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 
the potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated  with approximately million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
additionally  we have guaranteed approximately million of franchisee loans of various equipment programs 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and  historically  we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees 
if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable 
if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of  million and a fair value of plan assets of million at december  the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at december  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately million to million in the increase is primarily driven by increases in amortization of net loss and interest costs  partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to increases in the plan assets balance during a basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets  for purposes of determining pension expense  at december  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our us pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our us plan assets have experienced  along with a decrease in discount rates over time  have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule 
we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
based on the results of this analysis  we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives  respectively 
upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income taxes at december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of million  as well as our other deferred tax assets  to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage  including approximately million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
additionally  we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately million at december   as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested 
if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances  deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute more than of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased approximately million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors
