critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
use of estimates and assumptions the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue  expenses  and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
investments we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high quality corporate and government issuers 
all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments 
all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle 
such securities are classified as short term investments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature 
except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary  net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments our estimates of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 

table of contents concentrations  credit risk and credit risk evaluation concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments  and accounts receivable 
as of december   we placed our cash equivalents and investments primarily through one financial institution  city national bank cnb  and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument 
these amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds 
the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices 
credit risk  customer and vendor evaluation accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
we apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance 
in addition  we record an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
historically  such losses have been within our expectations 
revenue concentrations we derive our revenue from two service offerings  or products advertiser networks and publisher solutions 
for the year ended december   iac search and media iac or company accounted for of net revenue  and of publisher solutions revenue 
on may   ask sponsored listings  a division of iac  notified us that it did not intend to renew the may adcenter license  hosting and support agreement  which provides for certain publisher solutions services the agreement upon its expiration 
the agreement  as amended  was scheduled to expire by its terms on december  on december   we further amended the agreement  effective december   to extend the term through march   and to allow iac to extend the term in one month intervals up to a maximum period of six months 
on march   iac notified us that  in accordance with december amendment to the agreement  it intends to extend the term of the agreement on a monthly basis up to june  our largest category of customers has been intermediaries  the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers 
revenue recognition our online search advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our products 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser networks  are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called traffic acquisition costs tac and are included in cost of revenues 
the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 
we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including licenses to the adcenter 
these license arrangements include multiple elements revenue sharing based on the publisher s 
table of contents customer s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  upfront fees  and other license fees 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  other license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether a provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions 
we will record an increase or reduction of the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection rates or economic conditions are more or less favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
intangible assets with definite lives we amortize acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods from two to seven years and the amortization expense is primarily classified as cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december of each year 
us gaap require that a two step test be performed to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a determination of whether the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step involves an analysis reflecting the allocation of fair value determined in the first step as if it was the purchase price in a business combination 
this process may result in the determination of a new amount of goodwill 
if the calculated fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit  the difference is reflected as a non cash impairment loss 
the purpose of the second step is only to determine the amount of goodwill that should be recorded on the balance sheet 
the recorded amounts of other items on the balance sheet are not adjusted 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill testing 
we estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit utilizing up to three valuation methods market capitalization  income approach and market approach 
revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performance 
we had no goodwill recorded at december  and in december  as a result of completing the annual goodwill impairment test with the assistance of a third party valuation expert  we concluded that the 
table of contents carrying value of our single reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
due to the fact that us gaap required us to allocate significant value to previously unrecognized identifiable assets  the remaining fair value that was allocated to goodwill was eliminated  resulting in an impairment of million 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets held or used in operations  including property and equipment and internally developed software  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
subject assets are tested for impairment at the lowest level of operations that generates cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from those of other groups of assets and liabilities 
we have determined that the equity of our single reporting unit to be the lowest level of operation at which independent cash flows could be identified 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose 
for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the discontinued operations of the furl asset held for sale 
in  purchased technology of million was fully impaired because an associated initiative was discontinued 
we tested our long lived assets used in operations for impairment as of december  and determined they were not impaired 
internal use software development costs we capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to developing internal use computer software 
we exercise judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts  and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures that substantially increase an asset s useful life are capitalized 
restructuring charges we have recorded restructuring accruals related to closing of certain leased facilities  as well as severance costs related to workforce reductions 
our judgment is required when estimating when the redundant facilities will be subleased and at what rate they will be subleased 

table of contents traffic acquisition costs we enter into agreements of varying durations with our distribution network partners that display our listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenue per click that we receive when the ads are clicked on those partners sites 
we also enter into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates 
there are generally three economic structures of the affiliate agreements guaranteed fixed payments which often carry reciprocal performance guarantees from the affiliate  variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks  or a combination of the two 
we record tac expense as a cost of revenue and is based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid introductions  number of searches  or other metrics 
advertising costs advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred 
product development costs research and development of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation costs for all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using the black scholes method 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service periods 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  based on historical rates 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations includes i compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet fully vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimates and ii compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we record liabilities  where appropriate  for all uncertain income tax positions 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense

in accordance with us gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our single reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december of each year 
prior to our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december   we considered whether to test goodwill in the third quarter of although our stock price declined during this timeframe  and our net book value exceeded our market capitalization as of september   we viewed this to be primarily indicative of the extreme volatility in the united states and global equity markets and believed the decline to be short term in nature 
therefore  management concluded that as of september   there were not events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value 
in december  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on our single reporting unit with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
we used the two step test required by us gaap 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test consisted of comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
we estimated the fair value of the company using various methods and compared the fair value to the carrying amount net book value to ascertain if potential goodwill impairment existed 
we utilized methods that focused on our ability to produce income the income approach and the estimated consideration we would receive if there were a sale of the company the market approach 
consideration was given to our discounted projected cash flows  our market capitalization and market multiples of comparable companies within our industry 
the key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value in step one of the test included the following management s operating projections for through including revenues  operating margins  working capital investments and capital expenditures based on our historical results and expectations 
the cash flows utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimated using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the appropriate wacc was determined by calculating a wacc based upon publicly traded companies comparable to looksmart 
total enterprise value tev multiples of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to ours were applied to our operating results to determine market approach fair value 
the per share price of our common stock and our overall market capitalization  including a control premium  was also considered in the fair value analysis 
based on the fair value estimated in step one  we determined a step one failure occurred which indicated a goodwill impairment may exist 
we proceeded to the step two analyses which included estimating the fair value of our assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the income approach was utilized to value our identified intangible assets  including existing technology  in process research and development technology  customer relationships and the looksmart trade name 
as a result of step two of the 
table of contents test  the carrying value of our goodwill was deemed to exceed the allocated fair value and we recorded a million goodwill impairment for which represented the entire remaining goodwill balance 
we also tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december  we determined that no impairment existed for assets held and used as of december  however  a million impairment existed for the furl assets held for sale and is included in loss from discontinued operations for intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and is assessed for impairment under us gaap  requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributed to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less the cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair market value is determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved

as a result  beginning in the first quarter of  furl assets  consisting of property and equipment  capitalized software  goodwill and intangibles were accounted for as assets held for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the furl assets were impaired due to the lack of marketability and the decision to wind down the furl operations 
as a result  the company recognized an impairment charge of million during on february   the company sold the furl assets and received a warrant to purchase million shares of the acquirer s non marketable common stock at an exercise price of per share in each case  subject to certain adjustments in certain circumstances 
the warrant expires in february the company determined the warrants received had no significant value and did not record a gain on the disposal

liquidity and capital resources cash flows were as follows in thousands year ended december  change net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances were as follows as of december  and in thousands december  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments total of total assets total assets at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash equivalents and short term investments are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government  commercial paper  time deposits  money market mutual funds and us corporate securities 
see note to the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which describes further the composition of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to our operating loss and the use of capital to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities  including the payment of an indemnification settlement and its related legal costs of million  acquisition of property and equipment  development of capitalized software and payment of capital lease obligations  which were partially offset by accounts receivable collections 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as our capital lease lines and the cash flow that we generate from our operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  capital lease lines and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months  if not longer 
our liquidity could be negatively affected by an additional decrease in demand for our services beyond the impact of the loss of the iac adcenter license  hosting and support agreement  which provides for certain publisher solutions services  and changes in customer buying behavior that may result from the continued general economic downturn 
in addition  our liquidity could be negatively affected if we are in default under our credit facilities and are required to pay the lenders in cash in an amount equal to the capital lease balance  or are required to identify restricted cash equal to the capital lease balance  plus outstanding standby letters of credit 
also  if the banking system or the financial markets continue to remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures  take advantage of favorable business opportunities  develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  develop new product and service offerings  take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures 
in addition  unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments  including the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows  may necessitate additional financing 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
in the third quarter of  we launched post pay whereby self service customers pay for clicks after they occur rather than the prior practice of being billed in advance 
the customer s credit card is charged based on its history of activity and creditworthiness 
as of december   this change resulted in a decrease in deferred revenue as those customers with prepaid balances have used those funds in their account 
as we expected  this decrease continued in the fourth quarter as customers continued to utilize their prepaid balances 
now that most of the prepaid funds have been used  customers will be billed after their account reaches their billing threshold or in days  whichever comes first 
as a result of the launch of post pay  our cash flow was adversely affected by million as customer deferred balances were used up and new unpaid charges accumulated 
we expect that the adverse cash flow affect of launching post pay is substantially complete as of december   and we do not expect this change to have a significant impact on the liquidity and capital resources of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipalities in the us  time deposits  money market mutual funds and corporate securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our income from investments may decrease in the future 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities that is not significant at december
