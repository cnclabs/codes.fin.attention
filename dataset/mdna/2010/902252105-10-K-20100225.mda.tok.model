item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events  trends  expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition  results of operations or business 
forward looking statements often contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  foresees  forecasts  estimates  plans  intends  continues  may  will  should  projects  might  could or other similar words or phrases 
similarly  statements that describe our business strategy  outlook  objectives  plans  intentions or goals also are forward looking statements 
we believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward looking statements  but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward looking statements 
we presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs economic  political and market conditions  including the recent global economic and financial crisis  and the general tightening of access to debt or equity capital  our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors  including project delays by our customers  reductions in transaction size  fewer transactions  delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements  changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our customers  primarily local and state governments  that could negatively impact information technology spending  technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services  our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses  while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations  competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing  customer retention and pressure for new products or services  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel  and costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations 
a detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in item a  risk factors 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward looking statements 
overview general we provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector  with a focus on local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide subscription based services such as hosted solutions as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products generally automate three major functional areas financial management and education  courts and justice  and property appraisal and tax and other 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses  subscription based services  software services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services 
because the majority of the software we sell is off the shelf  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which are a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase 
table of contents due to our historically low customer turnover 
during  approximately of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements and our customer turnover was approximately cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation  subscription based services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses  subscription based services  and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
as of december   our total employee count increased to  from  at december  approximately a third of these additions were to our implementation and support staff  including additions that increased our capacity to deliver our backlog 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  share based compensation expense  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 
liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in property and equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
in  we purchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we also paid million for common stock repurchases accrued as of december  during we used cash of million to acquire two companies and invested million in property and equipment 
our investment in property and equipment included million for an office building and we expect to pay the final retainage payment of million for this office building by mid we also paid down million on our short term revolving line of credit 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
acquisitions on july   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of kpl  inc d b a parker lowe associates parker lowe for  in cash 
parker lowe provides scanning and retrieval software and related services for land record and social services offices in local governments primarily in the north carolina area 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of assessment evaluation services  inc aes 
aes develops integrated property appraisal solutions and specializes in applications that deal with the unique provisions of the california revenue and taxation code 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash 
in connection with these transactions we acquired total tangible assets of approximately  and assumed total liabilities of approximately  including  for contingent consideration for which we have paid  as of december  we recorded goodwill of approximately million  all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes  and other intangible assets of approximately  the  of intangible assets is attributable to acquired software and customer relationships that will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
our balance sheet as of december  reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the operating results of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 
we believe these acquisitions will complement our business by expanding our presence in certain geographic areas and adding to our customer base 
in the twelve months ended december   we also paid approximately million for certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information management solutions 
outlook the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide 
broad economic conditions remain uncertain and public sector entities continue to experience pressures that are reflected in longer than normal decision processes 
local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in the first quarter of and for the calendar year 
while market conditions are not robust  we have great stability from the foundation of recurring revenues and high customer retention 
our base of recurring revenues from maintenance and support and subscription based services is approximately 
table of contents of total revenues 
consistent with our historical trends  we expect that first quarter earnings will not reach the level achieved in the fourth quarter of  and will likely be below last years first quarter earnings 
we also expect that in excess of of our annual earnings will occur in the second half of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingencies 
the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage of completion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition  the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  determination of share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition and asc  software revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses  subscription based services  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution 
these amounts have historically been nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  as discussed in asc  construction type and certain production type contracts  for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we measure progress to completion primarily using labor hours incurred  or value added 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to five years 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

table of contents for subscription based services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements  we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting  as defined by asc  multiple element arrangements  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iv there is a general right of return 
we consider the applicability of asc and with respect to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware on a contract by contract basis 
in hosted term based agreements  where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software  hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software 
for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand alone value to the customer  we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  anticipated operating income growth rates  our long term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing 
our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments and consistent with the reporting units tested for impairment in prior years 
assets  liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and reductions in growth rates 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed during the second quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
during we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment 
a 
table of contents hypothetical decrease in the fair value of either of our reporting units as of december  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total financial management and education courts and justice appraisal and tax and other total software license revenues in we signed large new contracts with average software license fees of approximately  compared to large new contracts signed in with average software license fees of approximately  we consider contracts with a license fee component of  or more to be large 
although a contract is signed in a particular year  the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note in the notes to financial statements 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions declined million compared to the prior year 
we acquired several student information and financial management solutions for k schools from january through august excluding the impact of these acquisitions software license revenue would have declined million 
the decline was due to several factors 
in our sales cycle to negotiate and close contracts which have reached the 
table of contents request for proposal phase lengthened slightly mainly due to budgetary constraints related to declining economic conditions 
as a result the purchasing processes for some of our customers have been extended to include more approval and documentation requirements 
the software installation period for most of our financial management and education solutions is relatively short and delays in the timing of signing new contracts will impact our results in the short term 
in addition  a few contracts have included requirements to construct interfaces to existing systems or other essential functionality which results in recognizing revenue over a longer period of time 
while we expect to continue to experience longer than normal sales cycles in and continued weakness through mid  we currently expect financial management and education solutions software license revenues for to be slightly higher than software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased million in compared to both and included approximately million of revenue from contracts which had been deferred in accordance with the terms of these contracts 
courts and justice software license revenues were higher in due to contract arrangements that included more software license revenue than in the comparable prior year periods  slight price increases and improved installation processes as our primary courts and justice solution matures 
in addition approximately million of the increase related to achieving certain milestones for several contracts 
we do not expect similar large adjustments to courts and justice software solutions revenue in due to recognition of revenue previously deferred in accordance with contract language 
therefore we currently expect courts and justice software solutions software license revenue in to increase at a much slower rate compared to subscriptions 
subscription based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings  software subscriptions and disaster recovery services 
asp and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually 
new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers who converted to our asp model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 
in june  as a result of changes in its technology organization  one customer terminated its asp arrangement with us and elected  as provided in the asp contract  to purchase the software instead 
this contract contributed approximately  of subscription revenue in each of the first two quarters of software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprise approximately of our software services revenue in the periods presented  increased compared to we acquired several student information and financial management solutions for k schools from january through august excluding the impact of these acquisitions  software services revenue increased  which was mainly due to additions to our implementation and support staff as well as leverage in the utilization of our implementation and support staff 
software services revenue related to courts and justice solutions comprise approximately of our software services revenues in the periods presented and increased compared to these increases reflect our increased capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff and slightly higher rates on some arrangements 
also  increased contract volume in our municipal courts software solutions  primarily in texas  generated higher related services revenue 
maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased in compared to maintenance and support services grew in  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
appraisal services revenue declined in compared to the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid we began several new revaluation contracts late and as a result currently expect appraisal revenues to increase slightly in 
table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license and acquired software 
amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products comprised approximately of our cost of software license revenues in compared to approximately of our cost of software license in the remaining balance is made up of third party software costs 
once a product is released  we begin to amortize  over the estimated useful life of the product  any capitalized costs associated with its development 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  which is generally five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers  and rent for related office space 
cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions 
we completed several acquisitions in the period through and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in late software associated with one significant acquisition completed in december became fully amortized 
in  our software license gross margin percentage rose significantly compared to the prior year periods because several products became fully amortized in late  as did software acquired related to a significant acquisition in december we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in or software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
cost of software services  maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
we have increased our implementation and support staff for both the financial management and education solutions and courts and justice solutions by employees since in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 
this increase was offset somewhat by fewer employees for appraisal and tax solutions 
the 
table of contents software services  maintenance and subscription based services gross margin also benefited from slightly higher rates for certain services 
appraisal services 
our appraisal gross margin increased compared to as the result of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex project 
a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable  as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
our blended gross margin for was higher than due to lower amortization expense of software development costs described above 
the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  travel  share based compensation expense  commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as  professional fees  trade show activities  advertising costs and other marketing related costs 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in sg a expenses included higher share based compensation expense  commission costs and marketing expenses 
marketing expenses in include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative 
our sg a employee count increased from research and development expense research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development and enhancements and upgrades provided to existing customers under maintenance plans 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues research and development expense research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project  in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts 
we have increased our research and development staff by employees since in january  we entered into a software development and license agreement  which provided for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation microsoft to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide 
in september  tyler and microsoft signed an amendment to the software development and license agreement  which grants microsoft intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs 
in and  we offset our research and development expense by million and million  respectively  which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 
in september  tyler and microsoft signed a statement of work under the amended software development and license agreement for which we currently expect to recognize offsets to our research and development expense by approximately  each quarter through the end of in addition  in october  the scope of the project was further expanded that will result in additional offsets to research and development expense  varying in amount from quarter to quarter  with the first payment to be invoiced on august  and invoiced quarterly through march  for a total of approximately million 
the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 

table of contents non cash legal settlement related to warrants on june   we settled outstanding litigation related to the warrants owned by bank of america  n 
a 
bana 
as disclosed in prior sec filings  the warrants entitled bana to acquire million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of per share 
following court ordered mediation  in july  bana paid us million and we issued to bana  restricted shares of tyler common stock 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of million  which was not tax deductible 
amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles 
the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues  while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles in we completed several acquisitions and purchased certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information management solutions 
these transactions increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately  this amount will be amortized over approximately years 
estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles  excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues  for the next five years is as follows in thousands other other expense income in and includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october other income in also included million of interest income which declined due to significantly lower invested cash balances in our invested cash balances declined due to purchases of treasury stock and investments in office facilities in late and income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate declined compared to mainly due to a non cash legal settlement related to warrants charge of million in  which was not deductible 
in addition to the impact of the non deductible non cash legal settlement charge in  
table of contents the effective income tax rate for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
approximately of our stock option awards qualify as incentive stock options isos for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
non qualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 
compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses subscriptions software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total financial management and education courts and justice appraisal and tax and other total software license revenues changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to our financial management and education solutions for increased compared to the prior year 
revenue from student information management solutions as well as student transportation management solutions acquired in the last twelve months contributed substantially to the increase 
the remaining increase was mainly due to contract arrangements that included more software license revenue than in the past 
software license revenue related to our courts and justice software solutions increased for compared to the prior year 
new statewide contracts in indiana and new mexico contributed approximately two thirds of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an expanded presence in the markets for municipal courts software solutions and public safety software solutions 
subscriptions 
new asp customers and existing customers converting to asp arrangements provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to new disaster recovery customers and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 

table of contents software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial management and education solutions  which comprises slightly more than half of our software services revenue in the years presented  increased substantially compared to this increase was driven in part by increased capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff since and due to larger and more complex contracts  which include more programming and project management services 
in addition  we acquired a student transportation management solution in january which contributed approximately million to software service revenues in excluding the impact of acquisitions  we added approximately employees to our financial management and education implementation and training staff during software services revenue related to our courts and justice solutions experienced strong increases compared to  reflecting increased capacity to deliver backlog following additions to our implementation and support staff since mid in addition  increased contract volume for municipal courts software solutions and public safety software solutions also generated higher related services revenue 
we added approximately employees to our courts and justice implementation and training staff during maintenance 
maintenance revenues increased in compared to excluding the impact of acquisitions  maintenance and support services grew in this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
appraisal services revenue declined in compared to in late  we substantially completed several projects related to the ohio revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years  as well as a few other large contracts 
appraisal revenues for the first six months of were down compared to the first six months of in mid we began a complete reappraisal of real property in orleans parish  louisiana 
as a result of this contract and an overall increase in contract volume  appraisal revenues for the last six months of increased over the last six months of 
table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license 
in  our software license gross margin percentage rose compared to the prior year mainly due to strong license fee revenue increases 
because approximately one half of our cost of software license revenues in both periods is comprised of amortization of capitalized development costs  increased license fee revenues inherently result in higher gross margins 
software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
we have increased our implementation and support staff by employees during in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 
this increase includes employees related to acquisitions completed in appraisal services

the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by scheduled revaluation cycles in various states 
we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid our appraisal gross margin and segment operating income increased compared to as the result of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex appraisal project 
a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable  as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion

financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of million and current and non current investments of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of million and current and non current investments of million at december  as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 
these letters of credit expire through mid the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december in thousands cash flows provided by used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
other capital resources include cash on hand  public and private issuances of debt and equity securities  and bank borrowings 
the capital and credit markets have become more volatile and tightened as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  cash on hand and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  income tax obligations  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
in  operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily generated from net income of million  non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash share based compensation expense of million and a decrease in working capital of million offset slightly by a million decrease related to deferred income taxes 
working capital declined due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities pertaining to timing of payments on vendor invoices and income tax liabilities and an accrued liability of million for a retention payment related to construction of an office building 
other sources of working capital were deferred revenue related to december maintenance billings and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
these working capital declines were offset somewhat by an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base 
the increase in accounts receivable was offset slightly by the collection of several large customer billings  one of which had been outstanding for over twelve months 
cash flows provided by operating activities in included several advance payments from customers 
in general  changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings 
our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 
non current investments available for sale consist of two auction rate municipal securities ars which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities 
short term investments 
table of contents available for sale consists of the portion of one of these ars which was partially redeemed at par during the period january  through february  these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities ranging from to years  for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every days 
however  due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these securities have not occurred since february both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july through february as of december  we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars 
because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model 
the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to  the securities collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future  we have classified our ars as non current investments 
in association with this estimate of fair value  we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized loss on our non current ars of  net of related tax effects of  in  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
the unrealized loss includes the impact of adjusting previously recorded unrealized losses of approximately  net of related tax effects of  as of december  for several ars which were subsequently redeemed for million at par during we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell  nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis 
we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities  have redemption features which call for redemption at of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aaa 
the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds payment of principal and accrued interest  if it becomes necessary 
in addition  both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july through february based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business  and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of our ars and in the future  depending upon existing market conditions  we may be required to record an other than temporary decline in market value

the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our property 
the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments  advances  cash dividends or loans  restricts the amount of our common stock we may purchase and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens

we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in  but the actual amount and timing of those costs  and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development 
capital spending in is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future

this new update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is allowed
