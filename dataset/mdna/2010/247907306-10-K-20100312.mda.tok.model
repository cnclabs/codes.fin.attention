item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a denver  colorado based independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the exploration for  and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil 
our core areas of operation are the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions  which comprise virtually all of our proved reserves  production and long term growth prospects 
we have a significant drilling inventory that consists of proved and unproved locations  the majority of which are located in our rocky mountain development projects 
at december   we had estimated proved reserves that totaled bcfe  of which were proved developed  with an after tax pv value of million 
for the year ended december   we reported net production of mmcfe per day 
as of december   our proved reserves were comprised of approximately bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil  or gas on an equivalent basis 
approximately of our proved reserves were located in the rocky mountains  in the gulf coast and less than in other locations 
we expect that our drilling efforts and capital expenditures  when announced  will focus primarily on our piceance basin assets in the rockies  as of december   we controlled approximately  net undeveloped acres  representing approximately of our total acreage position 
we retain a high degree of operational control over our asset base  with an average working interest in excess of excluding our columbia river basin properties as of december  this provides us with controlling interests in a multi year inventory of drilling locations  positioning us for continued reserve and production growth through our drilling operations when commodity prices support such activity 
we also have a controlling ownership interest in a drilling company  providing the benefit of access to drilling rigs primarily located in the rocky mountain region 
we concentrate our exploration and development efforts in fields where we can apply our technical exploration and development expertise  and where we have accumulated significant operational control and experience 
developments on april   dhs entered into the dhs forbearance  as amended on may   with lcpi in which lcpi agreed to forbear until june  from exercising its rights and remedies under the credit agreement including  among other actions  acceleration of all amounts due under the credit agreement or foreclosure on the dhs rigs and other assets pledged as collateral  including accounts receivable 
because the forbearance period has expired and because of december  financial covenant violations by dhs  lcpi currently has the right to demand payment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and  if not paid  foreclose on the dhs assets pledged as collateral under the credit agreement 
as of december   borrowings outstanding under the dhs facility were million 
on may   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of million  net of underwriting commissions and related offering expenses 
on may   we purchased for million contingent payment rights previously sold to tracinda corporation that entitled tracinda to receive up to million of net proceeds from offshore california litigation related to the amber case 
on may   we settled litigation filed in the united states court of federal claims in washington  dc by us and our owned subsidiary  amber resources company of colorado  with respect to undeveloped federal leases  some of which were part of our and amber s offshore california properties the amber case  and received from the us government million of litigation proceeds 
in early june  we paid out million of royalty payments to third parties related to the amber case 
on september   gray well completion results were announced 
the well did not encounter commercial quantities of gas and was written off as a dry hole during the quarter ended september  in october  we entered into a new marketing arrangement for the majority of our operated piceance basin gas 
although our new arrangement results in higher transportation costs vega gas transportation expense increased from approximately per mmbtu to per mmbtu  this increase is more than offset by higher revenues from improved natural gas liquids recoveries at a higher efficiency processing plant liquids recovery factor increased from approximately gallons per mmbtu compared to gallons per mmbtu and a greater percentage of liquid proceeds retained increased from approximately of proceeds to of proceeds 
as a result of these changes  based on current commodity prices  our net realized price prior to hedging in the vega area has improved substantially 
in november  we retained strategic advisors to evaluate and advise the board of directors on strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and the process is currently in advanced stages 
such alternatives are expected to include  but may not be limited to  exploring the sale of some or all of our assets  entering into partnerships or joint ventures  or the sale of the entire company 
there can be no assurance that this evaluation of strategic alternatives will result in changes to our company  operations or business plan 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will pursue any particular transaction or transactions  or  if we do pursue any such transaction  that it will be completed or successful 
on december   we settled the lease case and received from the us government million of offshore litigation proceeds related to that case 
in december and january  we paid out million of royalty payments to third parties related to the lease case 
as of december   we had reduced borrowings under our credit facility to million  with million of availability based on the october  redetermined million borrowing base with a required availability cushion of million 
at february   our availability was million 
in addition  we obtained financial covenant relief for the quarters ending on december  and march  outlook as announced in november  we are working with our strategic advisors to analyze various alternatives to enhance stockholder value  which include a sale of some or all of our assets  entering into partnerships or joint ventures  or the sale of the entire company 
the evaluation of any particular transaction will involve  among other considerations  an analysis of our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for in respect of such transaction and other sources of liquidity  including cash from operations and our credit facility 
we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to this review until the board of directors has approved a course of action 
we are unable to accurately predict our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year  primarily due to the uncertainty relating to any potential strategic transaction  including the likelihood of such a transaction occurring  the type of transaction and the timing of any such transaction 
in addition  future redeterminations of our borrowing base under our credit facility  including the scheduled redetermination currently in process  may affect our liquidity available for capital expenditures making it difficult to accurately determine such amounts at the current time 
we expect to announce our drilling plans and expected oil and gas production once our strategic alternatives evaluation process and borrowing base redetermination are complete 
the exploration for and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil are highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to our profitability and long term value creation for our stockholders 
generating long term reserve and production growth represents an ongoing focus for management and is made particularly important in our business given the natural production and reserve decline associated with producing oil and gas properties 
our long term business strengths include a multi year inventory of attractive lower risk drilling on long lived rockies properties  which we believe will allow us to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically without having to rely solely on acquisitions  and significant leasehold positions in several high potential exploratory areas 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows on may   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of million  net of underwriting commissions and related offering expenses 
on may   we received from the us government million of offshore litigation proceeds related to the amber case and in early june we paid out million for third party contractual obligations and other participating interests related to the judgment 
further  on december  we received from the us government an additional million of litigation proceeds related to the offshore california lease and in late december and early january  we paid out a total of million for third party contractual obligations and other participating interests related to the judgment 
with proceeds from these transactions  we have reduced our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility from million at december  to million at december   with million of remaining availability based on our current million borrowing base with a required minimum availability of million and outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
the borrowing base is subject to a redetermination currently in process and could increase or decrease based on our reserves at such time 
in addition  we reduced our accounts payable from million at december  to million at december  during may  dhs sold rig to naknek electric association for cash proceeds of million which  combined with proceeds from minor spare equipment sales and the collection of accounts receivable  were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under the dhs credit facility from million at december  to million at december  as shown in the accompanying financial statements and discussed elsewhere herein  we experienced a net loss attributable to delta common stockholders of million for the year ended december  we were in compliance with the capital expenditure and accounts payables covenants under our credit facility at december  in the second amendment  we obtained waivers of our financial ratio covenants for periods ending december  and march  in addition  our dhs subsidiary remained out of compliance with the debt covenants under its credit facility and its forbearance agreement with lcpi expired on june  as a result  amounts outstanding under the dhs credit facility are classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  further  dhs is facing significant  potentially immediate  requirements to fund obligations in excess of its existing sources of liquidity if its senior lender exercises its right to demand payment of the amounts outstanding under dhs s credit facility 
dhs is in discussions with its credit facility lender regarding amendments  waivers or other restructuring of the credit facility  but there can be no assurance that the lender will agree to any such amendments 
our accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
during the year ended december   significant improvements to our liquidity position were achieved through the equity transaction  receipt of the offshore litigation proceeds  and asset sales described above  which substantially improved our financial position 
nevertheless  we have a deficiency in short term liquidity at dhs and possible additional liquidity issues if commodity prices remain at low levels and our banks further reduce our borrowing base as part of our next scheduled redetermination which is currently in process 
further  our credit agreement matures in january thus  our ability to continue as a going concern could be dependent upon our lenders willingness to amend terms  grant waivers  or restructure existing agreements  or our success in generating additional sources of capital in the near future  and or an increase in commodity prices 
we are in discussions with our lenders regarding an amendment or restructuring of the existing credit facility  as well as discussions regarding a possible new credit facility 
during the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million  net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million 
during this period we spent million on oil and gas development activities 
at december   we had million in cash and million available under our credit facility based on the borrowing base as re determined on october   total assets of billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
debt  excluding installments payable on property acquisition which are secured by restricted cash deposits  at december  totaled million  comprised of million of bank debt million of our indebtedness under our credit agreement and million of dhs indebtedness  of which the dhs indebtedness was classified as current at september   million of senior subordinated notes and million of senior convertible notes 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  the senior convertible notes are recorded at a discount to their stated amount due of million 
capital resources and requirements on march   we entered into the first amendment to the second amended and restated credit agreement the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  as further amended on april  and on april   with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and certain of the financial institutions that are party to our credit agreement in which  among other changes  the lenders provided us relief for a period ended may  from acting upon their rights and remedies as a result of our violation of accounts payable and current ratio covenants 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility replaced the previous consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitdax covenant with a senior secured debt to consolidated ebitdax requirement for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than to in accordance with the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  the borrowing base was reduced upon the successful completion of our capital raising efforts from million to million  with a conforming borrowing base of million 
on october   we entered into the second amendment in which  among other changes  the lenders provided waivers from the december  and march  current ratio and consolidated secured debt to ebitdax ratio covenants 
in conjunction with the second amendment and as part of a scheduled redetermination  the borrowing base was reduced from million to million 
the next scheduled semi annual redetermination is currently in progress 
also  the second amendment requires that we maintain minimum availability of million essentially reducing our borrowing availability under the credit agreement 
the minimum availability requirement will be released on the first date after delivery of the december  audited financial statements on which we are in compliance with our financial covenants as of the most recently completed quarter without giving effect to any waiver of compliance with such covenants and project pro forma compliance for each of the four following quarters 
in addition  the second amendment imposed capital expenditures limitations of million for the quarter ending december   million for the quarter ending march   and million for the quarter ending june   provided that any excess of the limitation over the amount of actual expenditures may be carried forward from an earlier quarter to a subsequent quarter 
the second amendment also included a payables covenant whereby our trade payables a sub component of accounts payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet may not exceed million  exclusive of any amounts owed by us to our subsidiary dhs 
as of december   we were in compliance with our capital expenditures and accounts payable limitations 
as of december   our corporate rating and senior unsecured debt rating were caa and ca  respectively  as issued by moody s investors service 
moody s outlook was negative 
as of december   our corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings were ccc and ccc  respectively  as issued by standard and poor s s p 
s p s outlook on its rating was developing 
our future cash requirements are largely dependent upon the number and timing of projects included in our capital development plan  most of which are discretionary 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  through cash provided by operating activities  sales of oil and gas properties  and through borrowings under our credit facility 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have a significant impact on our operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production and the success of our exploration and development activities in generating additional production 
there can be no assurance that the actions undertaken by us will be sufficient to repay the obligations under our credit facility  or  if not  or if additional defaults occur under that facility  that the lenders will be willing to waive further defaults or amend the facility 
there can be no assurance that dhs s lender will not exercise its right to demand payment of the amounts outstanding under the dhs credit facility and  if not paid  foreclose on the dhs assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility 
there can similarly be no assurance that our current levels of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement will remain in place  or that we will be successful in negotiating an extension to the credit agreement  or a replacement thereto  upon its scheduled maturity in january in addition  there can be no assurance that results of operations and other sources of liquidity  including asset sales and offshore litigation proceeds  will be sufficient to meet contractual  operating and capital obligations 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of uncertainty regarding our ability to raise additional capital  sell assets  otherwise obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations or to continue as a going concern 
as part of our consideration of potential strategic transactions  we continue to examine additional sources of long term capital including a restructured debt facility  the issuance of debt instruments  sales of assets and joint venture financing  as well as other potential corporate transactions 
the availability of additional sources of capital  which will impact our ability to execute our operating strategy and meet our liquidity challenges  will depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to items that have affected our results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth in thousands  for the periods presented  selected historical statements of operations data 
the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
years ended december  revenue oil and gas sales contract drilling and trucking fees gain on offshore litigation settlement  net of property sales gain loss on hedging instruments  net total revenue operating expenses lease operating expense transportation expense production taxes exploration expense dry hole costs and impairments depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas drilling and trucking operating expenses goodwill and drilling equipment impairments depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking general and administrative expense executive severance expense total operating expenses operating loss other income and expense interest expense and financing costs interest income other income expense realized gain loss on derivative instruments  net unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  net income loss from unconsolidated affiliates total other expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations of properties sold or held for sale  net of tax gain loss on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax net loss less net loss attributable to non controlling interest net loss attributable to delta common stockholders year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss attributable to delta common stockholders 
net loss attributable to delta common stockholders was million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of million or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations decreased from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december  the decreased loss was primarily due to fewer dry holes and impairments recorded in as compared to  offset by lower oil and gas sales 
explanations of significant items affecting comparability between periods are discussed by the financial statement captions below 
oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and gas sales from continuing operations were million  as compared to million for the comparable period a year earlier 
during the year ended december   production from continuing operations decreased by and the average natural gas and oil price decreased and respectively 
the average gas price received during the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf for the year earlier period and the average oil price received during the year ended december  was per bbl compared to per bbl for the year earlier period 
the production decrease was primarily related to production declines in the rockies and gulf coast areas that were not offset by additional drilling or completion activities due to the limited capital budget in contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although currently only one is working on a delta operated well 
drilling and trucking revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling and trucking revenues decreased in due to lower third party rig utilization in compared to the prior year  resulting from a significant industry slowdown attributable to lower commodity prices 
drilling and trucking revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated in consolidation 
gain on offshore litigation and property sales  net 
during  we recorded gains of million related to two offshore litigation awards 
see note  oil and gas properties  to the accompanying financial statements 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded losses of million on several non core property divestiture transactions 
production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depletion expense lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for the year ended december  remained relatively flat from the year earlier period 
however  lease operating expenses increased on a per unit basis primarily due to declining production 
the average lease operating expense was per mcfe in as compared to per mcfe for the year earlier period 
transportation expense 
transportation expense for the year ended december  was million  comparable to prior year costs of million  but up from per mcfe to per mcfe 
the increase on a per unit basis is primarily the result of changes to our vega gas marketing contract that went into effect in october whereby our gas is processed through a higher efficiency plant 
although we expect vega area transportation costs to increase on a per unit basis in as a result of these operations  based on current commodity prices  this increase is expected to be more than offset by higher revenues in the vega area from improved natural gas liquids recoveries and a greater percentage of liquids proceeds retained 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
exploration activities in were limited due to our funding constraints and primarily consisted of delay rental payments 
in contrast  significant amounts were spent in on seismic shoots in several areas of exploration activity 
dry hole costs and impairments 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period a year ago 
for the year ended december   our dry hole costs related primarily to our columbia river basin exploratory well the gray well in washington 
for the year ended december   our dry hole costs related primarily to greentown and hingeline exploratory projects in utah 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment provisions to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to our non operated garden gulch field in the piceance basin million  haynesville shale million  columbia river basin million  lighthouse bayou million  various gulf coast fields million  vega surface land million  various rockies fields million  pipe and tubular inventory million and paradox pipeline million 
these impairments generally resulted from sustained lower commodity prices for most of  near term expiring leasehold  unsuccessful drilling results  or our inability to meet contractual drilling obligations 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment provisions to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline of million 
the impairments resulted primarily from the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of and unsuccessful drilling results 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year earlier period 
depletion expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to a increase in the depletion rate 
our depletion rate increased to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year earlier period 
the increase is primarily due to the effects of low rockies gas prices throughout most of and low month average historical prices at december  on the reserves used in our depletion calculation 
based on current commodity prices  we expect our depletion rate to decline in due to additional rockies undeveloped reserves that can be recorded as proved as higher prices from more recent quarters replace lower prices from earlier in in the sec required month average historical price 
drilling and trucking operating expenses 
we had drilling and trucking operating expenses of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower third party rig utilization during but is not proportional to the decline in contract drilling and trucking fees due to fixed costs and costs associated with a large number of stacked rigs 
goodwill and drilling equipment impairments 
we performed our annual dhs goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended september   however  due to the deterioration in the market conditions and decreased utilization  we re evaluated the dhs goodwill and the fair values of our rigs as of december  we determined that the book value of the rigs was impaired by million 
as a result of the analysis performed at year end  we also wrote off the entire amount of dhs s goodwill of million 
during the second quarter of  we concluded that dhs spare equipment required impairments of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
the increase is due to less drilling done by dhs for us in as compared to depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis and is not impacted by changes in the utilization rate 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to lower expenses incurred on employee benefits and wages from reductions in force during and a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense 
we expect further reductions to full year cash general and administrative expenses in as cost saving measures implemented in take full effect in interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable year earlier period 
the increase is primarily related to the write off of deferred financing costs in conjunction with our reduced borrowing base  offshore litigation contingent payment financing costs  higher average debt balances and interest rates on the delta and dhs credit facilities  and non cash accretion of discount on an installment obligation payable to encana oil and gas usa inc encana 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the decrease is a result of lower interest earned on lower investment balances 
other income and expense 
other expense for the year ended december  includes million of impairment charges related to our auction rate securities and million related to a forfeited deposit for a rig acquisition that dhs was unable to close due to lehman s failure to fund under the dhs credit facility 
other income in was insignificant 
realized gain on derivative instruments  net 
effective july   we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting 
beginning july   we recognize realized gains or losses in other income and expense instead of as a component of revenue 
as a result  other income and expense includes million of realized losses and million of realized gains on derivative instruments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
unrealized gain on derivative instruments  net 
as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedge accounting  we recognize mark to market gains or losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  we recognized million of unrealized loss on derivative instruments in other income and expense during the year ended december  compared to an unrealized gain of million for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to lower commodity prices in the current year period 
income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 
loss from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december  is primarily the result of million of impairments to the carrying value of our investment in ally equipment  million in delta oilfield tank company dotc  million in collbran valley gas gathering  llc cvgg and million in arista in addition to the bad debt reserve of million to reduce the carrying value of our note receivable from dotc to the amount estimated to be collectible 
these impairments are the result of the industry wide downturn caused by the significant decline in commodity prices and the limitation on availability of credit in and through late which had a material adverse impact on our investments 
income tax benefit expense 
due to our continued losses  we were required by the more likely than not provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets beginning with the second quarter of our income tax benefit for the year ended december  of  relates only to dhs  as no benefit was provided for delta s net operating losses 
net income loss attributable to non controlling interest 
net income loss attributable to non controlling interest represents the non controlling investors percentage of their share of income or losses from dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the years ended december  and  dhs generated a loss resulting in a non controlling interest credit to earnings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss attributable to delta common stockholders 
net loss attributable to delta common stockholders was million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of million or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations attributable to delta common stockholders increased from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december   due primarily to million of impairments recorded during the fourth quarter due to the significant decline in commodity prices 
in addition  we recognized million of dry hole costs in the paradox  hingeline and other areas 
oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and gas sales from continuing operations were million  as compared to million for the comparable period a year earlier 
during the year ended december   production from continuing operations increased by and the average gas price increased 
the average gas price received during the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf for the year earlier period 
the average oil price received during the year ended december  increased to per bbl compared to per bbl for the year earlier period 
net gains from effective hedging activities were million for the year ended december  the gain in relates to effective hedging instruments during the period 
these gains are recorded as an increase in revenues 
for the year ended december   all realized derivative gains are included in other income 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although currently only two are working on delta operated wells 
drilling and trucking revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling and trucking revenues decreased in due to the average number of rigs working for delta from average rigs in compared to average rigs for the prior year 
drilling and trucking revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated in consolidation 
production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depletion expense lease operating expense 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
lease operating expense from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased proportionately with production 
the average lease operating expense per mcfe was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the year earlier period 
exploration expense 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs and lease rentals 
our exploration costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year earlier period 
exploration activities primarily include seismic shoots in two areas 
dry hole costs and impairments 
we incurred dry hole costs of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period a year ago 
for the year ended december   our dry hole costs related primarily to greentown and hingeline exploratory projects in utah 
for the year ended december   the dry hole costs related primarily to seven exploratory projects  three in texas  two in wyoming  one in colorado and one in utah 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline of million 
the impairments resulted primarily from the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of and unsuccessful drilling results 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairments totaling approximately million primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year earlier period 
depletion expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in depletion expense was due to a increase in production from continuing operations  slightly offset by a decrease in the depletion rate 
our depletion rate decreased to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year earlier period 
the decrease is partially due to lower finding costs per mcfe on our rockies drilling program and the effect of impairments recorded in drilling and trucking operating expenses 
we had drilling and trucking operating expenses of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the significant decrease in expenses was due to the increase in the average number of rigs working for delta in than in the prior year 
goodwill and drilling equipment impairments 
we performed our annual dhs goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended september   however  due to the deterioration in the market conditions and decreased utilization  we re evaluated the dhs goodwill and the fair values of our rigs as of december  we determined that the book value of the rigs was impaired by million 
as a result of the analysis performed at year end  we also wrote off the entire amount of dhs s goodwill of million 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
this decrease can be attributed to a greater average number of rigs working for delta in compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to an increase in staff and related personnel costs 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable year earlier period 
the increase is primarily related to higher average debt balances on the delta and dhs credit facilities and the non cash accretion of discount on an installment obligation payable to encana oil and gas usa inc encana 
in addition  the year ended december  includes million of non cash accretion of debt discount compared to million in the prior year period related to the convertible notes issued in april interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period

other expense for the year ended december  includes million of impairment charges related to our auction rate securities and million related to a forfeited deposit for a rig acquisition that dhs was unable to close due to lehman s failure to fund under the dhs credit facility 
realized gain on derivative instruments  net 
effective july   we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting 
beginning july   we recognize realized gains or losses in other income and expense instead of as a component of revenue 
as a result  other income and expense includes million and  of realized gains on derivative instruments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
unrealized gain on derivative instruments  net 
as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedge accounting  we recognize mark to market gains or losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  we recognized million of unrealized gains on derivative instruments in other income and expense during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to lower commodity prices in the current year period 
income tax benefit expense 
due to our continued losses  we were required by the more likely than not provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets beginning with the second quarter of our income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million relates only to dhs  as no benefit was provided for delta s net operating losses 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  include the kansas field  which was sold in january  the australia field and the new mexico and east texas properties  which were sold in march  the north dakota properties sold in september  and the washington county  colorado properties sold in october the results of operations from these assets during the year ended december  was an income of million  net of tax 
gain loss on sale of discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we completed an asset exchange agreement where we acquired additional interests in our midway loop properties in exchange for cash and certain non core properties 
the transaction resulted in a gain on the disposition of the non core properties of  during the year ended december   we sold non core properties in colorado  kansas  texas  new mexico  australia and north dakota for combined proceeds of million at a combined net loss of million 
net income loss attributable to non controlling interest 
net income loss attributable to non controlling interest represents the non controlling investors percentage of their share of income or losses from dhs in which they hold an interest 
during the years ended december  and  dhs generated a loss resulting in a non controlling interest credit to earnings 
historical cash flow our cash flow from operating activities decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of decreased production and lower commodity prices for most of the year 
our net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year earlier period  primarily due to our decreased drilling and acquisition activity 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily comprised of million of proceeds from the stock offering  offset by million of repayment of borrowings and was higher in primarily due to cash received from the tracinda transaction and additional bank borrowings 
our cash flow from operating activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased production and higher commodity prices for most of the year 
our net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year earlier period  primarily due to our increased drilling and acquisition activity and the investment of cash received in the tracinda transaction 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities was higher in primarily due to cash received from the tracinda transaction 
capital and exploration expenditures and financing our capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  in thousands capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions piceance haynesville lighthouse bayou austin chalk incremental interests garden gulch wyoming yates washington county  south and north tongue columbia river basin other other development costs drilling and trucking companies exploration costs financing sources cash provided by operating activities stock issued for cash upon exercised options stock issued for cash  net net long term borrowings proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties proceeds from sale of drilling assets proceeds from sale of marketable securities investments in and notes issued to affiliates increase in restricted deposit minority interest contributions other we are unable to accurately predict our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year  primarily due to the uncertainty relating to any potential strategic transaction  including the likelihood of such a transaction occurring  the type of transaction and the timing of any such transaction 
in addition  future redeterminations of our borrowing base under our credit facility  including the scheduled redetermination currently in process  may affect our liquidity available for capital expenditures making it difficult to accurately determine such amounts at the current time 
we expect to announce our drilling plans once our strategic alternatives evaluation process and borrowing base redetermination are complete 
changes in proved reserve quantities significant changes to our proved reserves are described below 
see also note  information regarding proved oil and gas reserves unaudited in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   positive gas revisions of bcf were primarily related to longer lived piceance basin wells due to higher gas pricing at year end and the increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries of bcfe was primarily comprised of rocky mountain proved reserve increases primarily from the company s piceance basin drilling program and related offset wells 
in addition  during  the company purchased incremental interests in its existing piceance basin acreage and in its existing gulf coast austin chalk acreage totaling bcfe 
finally  during  proved reserves totaling bcfe located in various states were sold in a series of transactions described in note  oil and gas properties discontinued operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   positive revisions totaling bcfe were primarily related to acre downspacing of the company s piceance basin proved undeveloped reserves and the increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries of bcfe was comprised of rocky mountain proved reserve increases primarily from the company s piceance basin drilling program and related offset wells 
also  during  the company purchased incremental interests in its existing piceance basin acreage and acquired new interests in adjacent leasehold to expand its vega area totaling approximately bcfe 
see note  oil and gas properties year ended december  acquisitions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the february transaction with encana 
during the year ended december   negative revisions totaling bcfe were primarily related to the loss of piceance basin undeveloped reserves as a result of lower pricing from utilizing the month historical average required by the new sec rules for use in the december  reserve report 
the increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries totaling bcfe was primarily comprised of rocky mountain proved reserve increases primarily from the company s piceance basin drilling program and related offset wells 
also  during  proved reserves totaling bcfe located in various states were sold in a series of transactions described in note  oil and gas properties year ended december  divestitures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
company acquisitions  divestitures and financings we plan to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  as well as divestitures of non core assets 
during the years ended december   and  we completed the following transactions on october   we divested our washington county  colorado assets in conjunction with an asset exchange transaction to acquire additional working interest in the garden gulch field in the piceance basin 
on september   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in north dakota for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale resulted in a gain of million 
on march   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in new mexico and east texas for cash consideration of approximately million  prior to customary purchase price adjustments 
the sale resulted in a loss of approximately million 
on march   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in australia for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale resulted in an after tax gain of million 
on january   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in padgett field  kansas for cash consideration of million 
the transaction resulted in a gain on sale of properties of  on february   we issued million shares of common stock to tracinda corporation at per share for gross proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of the transaction  subsequent purchases in the open market  and the may equity offering  tracinda currently owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
on february   we closed a million transaction with encana oil gas usa inc encana to jointly develop a portion of encana s leasehold interests in the vega area of the piceance basin 
we acquired over  drilling locations on approximately  gross acres with a working interest 
the effective date of the transaction was march  the related agreement superseded a march agreement with encana and accordingly we have no further drilling commitment to encana under the march agreement 
in march  dhs acquired three rigs and spare equipment for a purchase price of million 
the transaction was funded by the proceeds from two notes payable issued by dhs to delta and chesapeake of million each and of proceeds of million each from delta and chesapeake for additional shares of common stock issued by dhs 
on august  the million notes payable from both delta and chesapeake were converted into shares of dhs stock 
in july and august  we completed several transactions to acquire unproved leasehold interests in two prospect areas 
the total cost of the acquisitions was approximately million 
pursuant to one of the agreements  we were obligated to drill an initial appraisal well by july  but due to our inability drill such well  in late may  an amendment to the agreement was executed whereby the leases reverted to the original seller and the company retained an option to participate in future transactions  if any  related to the leases contained in the area of mutual interest 
in august  dhs acquired a  horsepower drilling rig with a  foot depth rating for a purchase price of million rig 
the acquisition was financed by an increase in the dhs credit facility 
on august   we completed an asset exchange agreement in which we acquired additional incremental interests in certain midway loop properties in exchange for million in cash and non core undeveloped properties in divide creek 
the transaction resulted in a gain of  during the year ended december  on september   we entered into an agreement with encana to acquire all of encana s net leasehold position and interest in wells in the columbia river basin of washington and oregon 
the purchase price for the leasehold properties was million and the transaction closed on september  on september   we completed a separate transaction related to the columbia river basin wherein we sold a working interest participation in all of our columbia river basin leasehold interests and wells for cash consideration of million plus one half of the drilling costs incurred to date on our well currently drilling in the area 
this transaction included one half of the leaseholds interests acquired from encana on september  during the fourth quarter of through a series of transactions  the company divested of certain non operated properties in alabama  california  colorado  louisiana  north dakota  oklahoma  texas and wyoming and certain non strategic operated properties in colorado and wyoming for cash consideration of million 
in addition  the company sold the amine unit from its paradox pipeline gas plant for million and various pipe and tubular inventory for proceeds of million 
these transactions resulted in a combined loss of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
contractual obligations for the years ending december  contractual obligations at december  thereafter total in thousands credit facility installments payable on property acquisitions senior unsecured notes interest on senior unsecured notes senior convertible notes credit facility dhs derivative liability abandonment retirement obligation operating leases total contractual cash obligations amounts due will be funded with restricted cash deposits on hand 
the convertible notes may be put to the company by the holders of the notes in april amounts outstanding under the dhs credit facility are classified as current due to their covenant violations at december  see credit facility dhs below for additional information 
credit facility on october   we entered into the second amendment in which  among other changes  our lender banks provided waivers from the december  and march  current ratio and consolidated secured debt to ebitdax ratio covenants 
in conjunction with the second amendment and as part of a scheduled redetermination  the borrowing base was reduced from million to million 
the next scheduled redetermination date is march  also  the second amendment requires that we maintain minimum availability of million essentially reducing our borrowing availability under the credit agreement 
under the terms of the second amendment  the minimum availability requirement will be released on the first date after delivery of the december  audited financial statements on which we are in compliance with our financial covenants as of the most recently completed quarter without giving effect to any waiver of compliance with such covenants and project pro forma compliance for each of the four following quarters 
in addition  the second amendment imposed capital expenditures limitations of million for the quarter ending december   million for the quarter ending march   and million for the quarter ending june   provided that any excess of the limitation over the amount of actual expenditures may be carried forward from an earlier quarter to a subsequent quarter 
the second amendment also included a payables covenant whereby our trade payables a sub component of accounts payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet may not exceed million  exclusive of any amounts owed by us to our subsidiary dhs 
as of december   we were in compliance with our capital expenditures and trade payables covenants 
the borrowing base is redetermined by the lending banks at least semiannually or by special redeterminations if requested by us based on drilling success 
the march scheduled redetermination is in process 
if  as a result of any reduction in the amount of our borrowing base  the total amount of the outstanding debt were to exceed the amount of the borrowing base in effect  then  within days after we are notified of the borrowing base deficiency  we would be required to make a mandatory payment of principal to reduce our outstanding indebtedness so that it would not exceed our borrowing base  eliminate the deficiency by making three equal monthly principal payments  provide additional collateral for consideration to eliminate the deficiency within days or eliminate the deficiency through a combination of through 
if for any reason we were unable to pay the full amount of the mandatory prepayment within the requisite day period  we would be in default of our obligations under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers and acquisitions  and includes various financial covenants 
under certain conditions  amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated 
bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to us or certain of our subsidiaries would result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases  other events of default under the credit facility would result in acceleration of the indebtedness at the option of the lending banks 
such other events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of obligations under the credit facility including financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  and a failure of the liens securing the credit facility 
this facility is secured by a first and prior lien to the lending banks on most of our oil and gas properties  certain related equipment  and oil and gas inventory 
installments payable on property acquisition on february   we closed a transaction with encana to jointly develop a portion of encana s leasehold interests in the vega area of the piceance basin 
under the terms of the agreement we have committed to fund million  of which million was paid at the closing  million was paid on november  and the remaining balance is due in two million installments due november   and these remaining installments are collateralized by a letter of credit  which in turn is collateralized by cash on deposit in a restricted account 
the installment payment obligation is recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as current and long term liabilities at a discounted value  initially of million  based on an imputed interest rate of 
the discount is being accreted on the effective interest method over the term of the installments  including accretion of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
senior unsecured notes  due on march   we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate amount of million which pay interest semi annually on april and october and mature in the senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over their term 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains various restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make certain investments  sell assets  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries 
these covenants may limit management s discretion in operating our business 
in addition  in the event that a change of control should occur as such term is defined in the indenture  each holder of the senior notes would have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
senior convertible notes  due on april   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes for net proceeds of million after underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  on may and november of each year  beginning november  the notes will mature on may  unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased  but each holder of notes has the option to require us to purchase any outstanding notes on each of may   may   may   may  and may  at a price which is required to be paid in cash  equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased 
the notes will be convertible at the holder s option  in whole or in part  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes  subject to prior repurchase of the notes 
the conversion rate may be adjusted from time to time in certain instances 
upon conversion of a note  we will have the option to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock for the notes surrendered 
in the event that a fundamental change occurs as defined in the indenture  but generally including a tender offer for a majority of our securities  an acquisition by anyone of or more of our stock  a change in the majority of our board of directors  the approval of a plan of liquidation or being delisted from a national securities exchange  each holder of notes would have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of its notes for the price specified in the indenture 
in addition  following certain fundamental changes that occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such fundamental changes by a number of additional shares of common stock 
also  we are not permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into  or convey  transfer  sell  lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets unless the successor company meets certain requirements and assumes all of our obligations under the notes 
if as a result of such transaction  the notes become convertible into common stock or other securities issued by another issuer  the other issuer must fully and unconditionally guarantee all of our obligations under the notes 
although the notes do not contain any financial covenants  the notes contain covenants that require us to properly make payments of principal and interest  provide certain reports  certificates and notices to the trustee under various circumstances  cause our wholly owned subsidiaries to become guarantors of the debt  maintain an office or agency where the notes may be presented or surrendered for payment  continue our corporate existence  pay taxes and other claims  and not seek protection from the debt under any applicable usury laws 
credit facility dhs on august   dhs entered into a new agreement with lehman commercial paper  inc lcpi to amend its existing lcpi credit facility 
the revised agreement increased the borrowing base from million to million 
total debt outstanding at december  under the facility was million 
because of lcpi s bankruptcy and default  dhs does not have any additional borrowing capacity under the lcpi facility 
under the revised agreement  dhs has an obligation to provide to lcpi by march of each year audited financial statements reported on without a going concern qualification or exception by the independent auditor 
dhs was not able to provide audited financial statements not containing an explanatory paragraph related to its ability to continue as a going concern  and  accordingly  dhs was not in compliance with this covenant at march  in addition  at december   dhs was not in compliance with its minimum ebitda  maximum leverage ratio  minimum interest coverage ratio and minimum current ratio financial covenants 
on april   dhs entered into the dhs forbearance  as amended on may   with lcpi in which lcpi agreed to forbear until june  from exercising its rights and remedies under the credit agreement including  among other actions  acceleration of all amounts due under the credit facility or foreclosure on the dhs rigs and other assets pledged as collateral  including accounts receivable 
the dhs facility is non recourse to delta 
due to the lapsing of the dhs forbearance as well as the september  and december  financial covenant violations by dhs  lcpi currently has the right to demand payment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and if not paid  foreclose on the dhs assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility 
although lcpi has not exercised its right to foreclose on the dhs assets pledged as collateral and dhs in currently in negotiations with lcpi to amend the terms of the credit facility  there can be no assurance that lcpi will not exercise its right to foreclose on the dhs assets pledged as collateral 
other contractual obligations our asset retirement obligation arises from the costs necessary to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells 
the majority of this obligation will not occur during the next five years 
we lease our corporate office in denver  colorado under an operating lease which will expire in our average yearly payments approximate million over the remaining term of the lease 
we have additional operating lease commitments which represent office equipment leases and lease obligations primarily relating to field vehicles and equipment 
we had a net derivative liability of million at december  the ultimate settlement amounts of these derivative instruments are unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information regarding our derivative instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
successful efforts method of accounting we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field are typically considered development costs and are capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved  and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  the availability and cost of capital to develop the reserves  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
based on the month average historical first of month prices required to be used under the new sec reserve reporting rules in determining proved reserves  none of our undeveloped locations in the piceance basin were able to be classified as proved undeveloped reserves at december  however  based on the old sec rules  we would be able to report our piceance basin proved undeveloped reserves see reserve sensitivities in item properties above as a result of higher prices at year end further development of these properties depends on expected higher commodity prices in the future  reductions in future drilling costs  or a combination of both 
impairment of gas and oil properties we review our oil and gas properties for impairment quarterly or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our developed proved properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the primary factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves  future production estimates  future commodity pricing  anticipated capital expenditures and production costs  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
for developed properties  the review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
as a result of this assessment  during the year ended december   we recorded impairment provisions to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to our non operated garden gulch field in the piceance basin million  haynesville shale million  columbia river basin million  lighthouse bayou million  proved and unproved impairments in various gulf coast fields million  vega surface land million  proved and unproved impairments in various rockies fields million  pipe and tubular inventory million and paradox pipeline million 
in  we recorded impairment provisions to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
the impairments were primarily due to the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline million  certain dhs rigs million and we wrote off dhs s goodwill million 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties 
for fiscal year  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain proved and unproved properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value which must be estimated using complex valuation models 
effective july   we elected to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively 
beginning july   we recognize mark to market gains and losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   we had a total of seven oil and gas derivative contracts outstanding 
the fair value of our oil derivative instruments was a liability of million and the fair value of our gas derivative instruments was a liability of million at december  the liability is discounted based on our credit worthiness and accordingly  the liability reflected is less than the actual cash expected to be paid upon settlement based on forward strip prices as of december  the pre credit risk adjusted fair value of our net derivative liabilities as of december  was million 
a credit risk adjustment of million to the fair value of the derivatives reduced the reported amount of the net derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to million 
asset retirement obligation we account for our asset retirement obligations under applicable fasb guidance which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for retirement obligations of acquired assets 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the plugging and abandonment liabilities for our oil and gas wells 
the fair value is estimated based on a variety of assumptions including discount and inflation rates and estimated costs and timing to plug and abandon wells 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we follow sfas to account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s current assessment  we maintain a significant valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in our reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  we may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased 
such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense or benefit 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the sec approved new rules designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows is now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 
disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserves guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction 
we adopted the rules effective december  in addition  in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update update  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new sec rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under us gaap with the requirements in the sec rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
see also note  information regarding proved oil and gas reserves unaudited  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the guidance requires the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component debt issued at a discount and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
this guidance was adopted effective january  this guidance changes the accounting treatment for our senior convertible notes issued april  and was applied retrospectively upon adoption 
the fair value of the liability and equity components was determined based on our estimated borrowing rate at the date of issuance and  as a result  the liability component was approximately million and the equity component was approximately million 
based on these components at the issue date we recorded a reduction to the carrying value of the notes of million upon adoption of the guidance  with a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include accretion of the resulting debt discount of approximately million and million for the three months and year ended december  and approximately million and million for the three months and year ended december  the remaining discount will be amortized through may when the holders of the notes can first require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes 
combined with the amortization of debt discount  the notes have an effective interest rate of approximately and with total interest costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in march  the fasb issued new rules related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities which required enhanced disclosures for derivative and hedging activities 
these rules were effective for us on january  we have included the new required disclosures in these financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new rules which established accounting and reporting standards for non controlling interests minority interests in subsidiaries 
these rules clarified that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity 
the rules were effective for us on january  and must be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which have been applied retrospectively 
the adoption of these rules had the effect of increasing total equity by the amount of the non controlling interest and changing other presentations in the accompanying financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  other than additional disclosures 
the guidance provided additional clarification for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and requires that companies provide interim and annual disclosures of the inputs and valuation technique s used to measure fair value 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  with such disclosures included herein as applicable 
in april  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance related to interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  other than requiring additional disclosures
