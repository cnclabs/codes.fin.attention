cash provided by operating activities totaled  net income contributed  to operating cash flow 
non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization contributed  and utilization of deferred income tax assets favorably impacted operating cash flow by  in addition  the net increase in the postretirement healthcare benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation 
changes in working capital favorably impacted cash provided by operating activities by  due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december   which primarily represents the investment made in the company s new manufacturing facility in mexico

a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  the table below includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 

table of contents the following table provides aggregated information about contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt line of credit interest operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures postretirement benefits total interest is calculated based the effective interest rates on the company s borrowing arrangements reflective of the interest rate swap agreements in place for the long term borrowings 
as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  workers compensation and self insurance healthcare accruals  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns  customer rework chargebacks  discounts offered to customers  and price adjustments 
should these customer returns  chargebacks  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company recorded allowances for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
the company had an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  
table of contents goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets annually on december or at interim periods if an indicator of impairment exists 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities that are below our assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and a decrease in future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill and a increase in the rate used to discount future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill 
self insurance the company is self insured with respect to most of its columbus and batavia  ohio and gaffney  south carolina medical and dental claims and columbus and batavia  ohio workers compensation claims 
the company has recorded an estimated liability for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at december  and of  and  respectively 
post retirement benefits management records an accrual for postretirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
core molding technologies recorded a liability for postretirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  the increase in the liability is attributable to an unrecognized loss of  and an increase to the liability of  related to service and interest costs 
this was offset by benefit payments of  recorded in revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products  chargebacks and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the related billing and expense payment timetable for individual projects and therefore does not necessarily reflect projected income or loss from tooling projects 
at december  the company recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
at december  the company recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its two largest customers navistar and paccar  and any recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of 
table of contents management recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination 
management has recognized all tax positions as of december  the deferred tax asset of  at december  primarily includes temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  as well as temporary differences between the book and tax value for inventory reserves and accrued liabilities of approximately  these are partially offset by a deferred tax liability related to property  plant and equipment of  inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
with the current economic conditions  inflation may not be a great concern  however  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding technologies primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
core molding technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the mexican peso 
core molding technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding technologies has the following five items that are sensitive to market risks industrial revenue bond irb with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  the revolving line of credit and  mexican loan payable under the credit agreement  each of which bears a variable interest rate   capex loan payable with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at bank term loan under the credit agreement  with a variable interest rate 
the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate for the foregoing at  foreign currency purchases in which the company purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to operations at the facility located in mexico  and raw material purchases in which core molding technologies purchases various resins for use in production 
the prices of these resins are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand 
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  core molding technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs  which would have an adverse effect on operating margins 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates would impact the company in both and it would have impacted the interest paid on the company s line of credit and the  mexican loan payable 
the interest rate on these loans is impacted by libor 
although a change in short term interest rates would impact the interest paid by the company  it would not have a material effect on earnings before tax 
a change in future interest rate curves would significantly impact the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps with an offset to other comprehensive income
