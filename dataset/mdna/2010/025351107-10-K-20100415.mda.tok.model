we are required to comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the procurement  administration and performance of us government contracts  and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations  and penalties and sanctions for any non compliance could adversely affect our business 
we are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of us government contracts  which affect how we do business with our customers and impose added costs on our business 
among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following the federal acquisition regulations along with agency regulations supplemental to the federal acquisition regulations  comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts  the truth in negotiations act requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  the cost accounting standards and cost principles imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based federal government contracts  and laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data 
we engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of us export control laws 
failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties  both civil and criminal  and can include debarment from contracting with the us government 
our contracting agency customers periodically review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts 
we also routinely perform internal reviews 
as a result of these reviews  we may learn that we are not in compliance with all of the terms of our contracts 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  
table of contents cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may also suffer harm to our reputation  which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
if we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation  our current business  future prospects  financial condition  and or operating results could be materially harmed 
in addition  we are subject to the industrial security regulations  protocols  and procedures of the us government as set forth in the national industrial security program operating manual nispom  which are designed to protect and safeguard classified information from unauthorized release to individuals and organizations not possessing a security clearance or the requisite level of clearance necessary to access that information 
accordingly  any failure to adhere to the requirements of the nispom could expose us to severe legal and administrative consequences  including  but not limited to  our suspension or debarment from government contracts  the revocation of our clearance  and the termination of our government contracts  the occurrence of any of which could substantially harm our existing business and preclude us from competing for or receiving future government contracts 
government contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bidding process that entails risks not present in the acquisition of commercial contracts 
a significant portion of our contracts and task orders with the us government is awarded through a competitive bidding process 
we expect that much of the business we seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding 
budgetary pressures and changes in the procurement process have caused many government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts  general services administration gsa schedule contracts and other government wide acquisition contracts gwacs 
these contracts  some of which are awarded to multiple contractors  have increased competition and pricing pressure  requiring us to make sustained post award efforts to realize revenue under each such contract 
competitive bidding presents a number of risks  including without limitation the need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we may spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us  the need to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we are awarded  and the expense and delay that may arise if our or our partners competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us or our partners pursuant to competitive bidding  and the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 
if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period  our business and prospects will be adversely affected  and that could cause our actual results to be adversely affected 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract  and the termination or non renewal of any of our significant contracts would cause our actual results to be adversely affected 

table of contents the us government may reform its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with the us government or its agencies  we believe that the success and development of our business will depend on our continued successful participation in federal contracting programs 
the current administration has signed a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on government contracting  which orders significant changes to government contracting  including the review of existing federal contracts to eliminate waste and the issuance of government wide guidance to implement reforms aimed at cutting wasteful spending and fraud 
the federal procurement reform called for in the memorandum requires the heads of several federal agencies to develop and issue guidance on review of existing government contracts and authorizes that any contracts identified as wasteful or otherwise inefficient be modified or cancelled 
if any of our contracts were to be modified or cancelled  our actual results could be adversely affected and we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new us government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of any modification or cancellation of our contracts 
in addition  there may be substantial costs or management time required to respond to government review of any of our current contracts  which could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
further  if the ordered reform of the us government s procurement practices involves the adoption of new cost accounting standards or the requirement that competitors submit bids or perform work through teaming arrangements  that could be costly to satisfy or could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
the reform may also involve the adoption of new contracting methods to gsa or other government wide contracts  or new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain socio economic or other policy objectives  such as establishing new set aside programs for small or minority owned businesses 
in addition  the us government may face restrictions from other new legislation or regulations  as well as pressure from government employees and their unions  on the nature and amount of services the us government may obtain from private contractors 
these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and  as a result  could harm our operating results 
our contracts with the us government and its agencies are subject to audits and cost adjustments 
unfavorable government audits could force us to adjust previously reported operating results  could affect future operating results and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions 
us government agencies  including the defense contract audit agency dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors incurred costs  administrative processes and systems 
certain of these agencies  including the dcaa  review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
they also review the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchase  property  estimation  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
moreover  if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with government requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
therefore  an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the dcaa or another government agency could cause actual results to be adversely affected and differ materially from those anticipated 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
each of these events could cause our actual results to be adversely affected 
a portion of our business depends upon obtaining and maintaining required security clearances  and our failure to do so could result in termination of certain of our contracts or cause us to be unable to bid or re bid on certain contracts 
obtaining and maintaining personal security clearances pcls for employees involves a lengthy process  and it can be difficult to identify  recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances 
if our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances  or if such employees who hold security clearances terminate their employment with us  the customer whose work requires cleared employees could 
table of contents terminate their contract with us or decide not to exercise available options  or to not renew it 
to the extent we are not able to engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively re bid on expiring contracts  which could adversely affect our business 
a facility security clearance fcl is an administrative determination by the defense security service dss  a us department of defense component  that a particular contractor facility has the requisite level of security  procedures  and safeguards to handle classified information requirements for access to classified information 
our ability to obtain and maintain fcls has a direct impact on our ability to compete for and perform us government contracts  the performance of which requires access to classified information 
our inability to so obtain or maintain any facility security clearance level could result in the termination  non renewal or our inability to obtain certain us government contracts  which would reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we may not realize the full amount of revenues reflected in our backlog  which could harm our operations and significantly reduce our future revenues 
there can be no assurances that our backlog estimates will result in actual revenues in any particular fiscal period because our customers may modify or terminate projects and contracts and may decide not to exercise contract options 
we define backlog as the future revenue we expect to receive from our contracts 
we include potential orders expected to be awarded under idiq contracts 
our revenue estimates for a particular contract are based  to a large extent  on the amount of revenue we have recently recognized on that contract  our experience in utilizing capacity on similar types of contracts  and our professional judgment 
our revenue estimate for a contract included in backlog can be lower than the revenue that would result from our customers utilizing all remaining contract capacity 
our backlog includes estimates of revenues the receipt of which require future government appropriation  option exercise by our clients and or is subject to contract modification or termination 
at december   our backlog was approximately million  of which we estimate will all be realized in these estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts  and we believe such estimates to be reasonable 
however  we believe that the receipt of revenues reflected in our backlog estimate for the following twelve months will generally be more certain than our backlog estimate for periods thereafter 
if we do not realize a substantial amount of our backlog  our operations could be harmed and our future revenues could be significantly reduced 
us government contracts often contain provisions that are typically not found in commercial contracts and that are unfavorable to us  which could adversely affect our business 
us government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the us government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including without limitation  allowing the us government to terminate existing contracts for convenience  as well as for default  establish limitations on future services that can be offered to prospective customers based on conflict of interest regulations  reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  decline to make orders under existing contracts  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  decline to exercise an option to renew a multi year contract  and claim intellectual property rights in products provided by us 

table of contents the ownership  control or influence of our company by foreigners could result in the termination  non renewal of or our inability to obtain certain us government contracts  which would reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we are subject to industrial security regulations of the us department of defense and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against unauthorized access by foreigners and others to classified and other sensitive information 
if we were to come under foreign ownership  control or influence  our clearances could be revoked and our us government customers could terminate  or decide not to renew  our contracts  and such a situation could also impair our ability to obtain new contracts and subcontracts 
any such actions would reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we depend on our suppliers and one  in particular  currently provides us with approximately of our supply needs 
if we cannot obtain certain components for our products or we lose any of our key suppliers  we would have to develop alternative designs that could increase our costs or delay our operations 
we depend upon a number of suppliers for components of our products 
of these suppliers  action group supplied approximately of the total purchases during the year ended december  moreover  action group supplied all of our steel pieces and hardware 
there is an inherent risk that certain components of our products will be unavailable for prompt delivery or  in some cases  discontinued 
we have only limited control over any third party manufacturer as to quality controls  timeliness of production  deliveries and various other factors 
should the availability of certain components be compromised through the loss of  or impairment of the relationship with  any of our key suppliers or otherwise  it could force us to develop alternative designs using other components  which could add to the cost of goods sold and compromise delivery commitments 
if we are unable to obtain components in a timely manner  at an acceptable cost  or at all  we would need to select new suppliers  redesign or reconstruct processes we use to build our transparent and opaque armored products 
we may not be able to manufacture one or more of our products for a period of time  which could materially adversely affect our business  results from operations and financial condition 
if we fail to keep pace with the ever changing market of security related defense products  our revenues and financial condition will be negatively affected 
the security related defense product market is rapidly changing  with evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to introduce new products  designs  technologies and features to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards  however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully introduce new products or features to our existing products or develop new products that will achieve market acceptance 
any delay or failure of these products to achieve market acceptance would adversely affect our business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
should we fail to keep pace with the ever changing nature of the security related defense product market  our revenues and financial condition will be negatively affected 
we believe that  in order to remain competitive in the future  we will need to continue to invest financial resources to develop new and adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies  including through internal research and development  acquisitions and joint ventures or other teaming arrangements 
these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects  and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies 
due to the design complexity of our products  we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate 
the failure of our technology to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our business 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products 

table of contents we may be subject to personal liability claims for our products and if our insurance is not sufficient to cover such claims  our expenses may increase substantially 
our products are used in applications where the failure to use our products properly or their malfunction could result in bodily injury or death  and we may be subject to personal liability claims 
although we currently maintain general liability insurance which includes million of product liability coverage  our insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims 
as a result  a significant lawsuit could adversely affect our business 
we may be exposed to liability for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of our products 
any future claim against us for personal injury or property damage could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and result in negative publicity 
we currently maintain insurance for this type of liability as well as seek support antiterrorism by fostering effective technologies act of also known as the safety act certification for our products where we deem appropriate 
however  although we maintain insurance coverage  we may experience legal claims outside of our insurance coverage  or in excess of our insurance coverage  or that insurance will not cover 
even if we are not found liable  the costs of defending a lawsuit can be high 
we are subject to substantial competition 
we are subject to significant competition that could harm our ability to win business and increase the price pressure on our products 
we face strong competition from a wide variety of firms  including large  multinational  defense and aerospace firms 
most of our competitors have considerably greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do  which may make it difficult to win new contracts and we may not be able to compete successfully 
certain competitors operate larger facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition and larger customer bases 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
moreover  we may not have sufficient resources to undertake the continuing research and development necessary to remain competitive 
we must comply with environmental regulations or we may have to pay expensive penalties or clean up costs 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  and regulations regarding protection of the environment  including air  water  and soil 
our manufacturing business involves the use  handling  storage  discharge and disposal of  hazardous or toxic substances or wastes to manufacture our products 
we must comply with certain requirements for the use  management  handling  and disposal of these materials 
if we are found responsible for any hazardous contamination  we may have to pay expensive fines or penalties or perform costly clean up 
even if we are charged  and later found not responsible  for such contamination or clean up  the cost of defending the charges could be high 
authorities may also force us to suspend production  alter our manufacturing processes  or stop operations if we do not comply with these laws and regulations 
we may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights and trade secrets from unauthorized use  and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of trade secrets  trademarks  and other intellectual property laws  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights to our products and production processes 
we currently have five utility and one provisional us pending patent applications 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims 
we have not emphasized  and do not presently intend to emphasize  patents as a source of significant competitive advantage  however  if we are issued patents we intend to seek to enforce them as commercially appropriate 

table of contents these measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or processes similar or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and we may face other obstacles to enforcing our intellectual property rights outside the united states including the ability to enforce judgments  the possibility of conflicting judgments among courts and tribunals in different jurisdictions and locating  hiring and supervising local counsel in such other countries 
although we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights  these efforts may not be successful 
from time to time  we may litigate within the united states or abroad to enforce our licensed patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights could be expensive  require management s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief 
furthermore  third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
our patents  if granted  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
although there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits against us  we may face litigation or infringement claims in the future 
infringement claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail 
a third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we depend on management and other key personnel and we may not be able to execute our business plan without their services 
our success and our business strategy depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel 
such individuals are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment offers 
we depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued participation of our executive officers and other key employees 
we presently maintain key man insurance on anthony piscitelli  our president and chief executive officer 
we believe that  as our activities increase and change in character  additional experienced personnel will be required to implement our business plan 
competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire them when required  or have the ability to retain them 
we may partner with foreign entities  and domestic entities with foreign contacts  which may affect our business plans by increasing our costs 
we recognize that there may be opportunities for increased product sales in both the domestic and global defense markets 
we have recently initiated plans to strategically team with foreign entities as well as domestic entities with foreign business contacts in order to better compete for both domestic and foreign military contracts 
in order to implement these plans  we may incur substantial costs which may include additional research and development  prototyping  hiring personnel with specialized skills  implementing and maintaining technology control plans  technical data export licenses  production  product integration  marketing  warehousing  finance charges  licensing  tariffs  transportation and other costs 
in the event that working with foreign entities and or domestic entities with foreign business contacts proves to be unsuccessful  this strategy may ineffectively use our resources which may affect our profitability and the costs associated with such work may preclude us from pursuing alternative opportunities 
we are presently classified as a small business and the loss of our small business status may adversely affect our ability to compete for government contracts 
we are presently classified as a small business as determined by the small business administration based upon the north american industry classification systems naics industry and product specific codes which are regulated in the united states by the small business administration 
while we do not presently derive a substantial portion of our business from contracts which are set aside for small businesses  we are able to bid on small business set aside contracts as well as contracts which are open to non small business entities 
it is also possible that we may become more reliant upon small business set aside contracts 
our continuing growth may cause us to lose our designation as a small business  and additionally  as the naics codes are periodically revised  it is possible that we may lose our status as a small business and may sustain an adverse impact 
table of contents on our current competitive advantage 
the loss of small business status could adversely impact our ability to compete for government contracts  maintain eligibility for special small business programs and limit our ability to partner with other business entities which are seeking to team with small business entities as may be required under a specific contract 
we intend to pursue international sales opportunities which may require export licenses and controls and result in the commitment of significant resources and capital 
in order to pursue international sales opportunities  we have initiated a program to obtain product classifications  commodity jurisdictions  licenses  technology control plans  technical data export licenses and export related programs 
due to our diverse products  it is possible that some products may be subject to classification under the united states state department international traffic in arms regulations itar 
in the event that a product is classified as an itar controlled item  we will be required to obtain an itar export license 
while we believe that we will be able to obtain such licenses  the denial of required licenses and or the delay in obtaining such licenses may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to sell products internationally 
alternatively  our products may be subject to classification under the united states commerce department s export administration regulations ear 
we also anticipate that we may be required to comply with international regulations  tariffs and controls and we intend to work closely with experienced freight forwarders and advisors 
we anticipate that an internal compliance program for international sales will require the commitment of significant resources and capital 
increases in our international sales may expose us to unique and potentially greater risks than are presented in our domestic business  which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
if our international sales grow  we may be exposed to certain unique and potentially greater risks than are presented in our domestic business 
international business is sensitive to changes in the budgets and priorities of international customers  which may be driven by potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions  regional and local economic and political factors  as well as us foreign policy 
international sales will also expose us to local government laws  regulations and procurement regimes which may differ from us government regulation  including import export control  exchange control  investment and repatriation of earnings  as well as to varying currency and other economic risks 
international contracts may also require the use of foreign representatives and consultants or may require us to commit to financial support obligations  known as offsets  and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements 
as a result of these and other factors  we could experience award and funding delays on international projects or could incur losses on such projects  which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  strategic acquisitions and investments  and these activities involve risks and uncertainties 
in pursuing our business strategies  we continually review  evaluate and consider potential investments and acquisitions 
in evaluating such transactions  we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities  technologies and other assets  and the risks and cost of potential liabilities 
furthermore  acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties  including the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from acquisitions or investments  the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives  the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
the outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we are defendants in a number of litigation matters 
these matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations 
although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the litigation matters to which we have been named a party and intend to contest each lawsuit vigorously  no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable 
table of contents to us 
an adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims  demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
please see business legal proceedings below 
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
furthermore  changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations  or their interpretation  could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses  thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
additionally  changes in the geographic mix of our sales could also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability 
risks relating to our common stock if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to report accurately our financial results 
this could have a material adverse effect on our share price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide accurate financial reports 
we completed documenting and testing our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules of the sec  which require  among other things  our management to assess annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on that assessment 
as a result of the material weaknesses identified during the course of our evaluation of our controls and procedures  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act was recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
we identified material weaknesses in our period end financial close processes and general computing controls 
to address these material weaknesses  we intend to engage outside experts to provide counsel and guidance in areas where we cannot economically maintain the required expertise internally 
please see part ii 
item a 
for further discussion 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that those controls will be adequate in all cases to uncover inaccurate or misleading financial information that could be reported by members of management 
if our controls failed to identify any misreporting of financial information or our management or independent registered public accounting firm were to conclude in their reports that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our shares could drop significantly 
in addition  we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange upon which our common stock may be listed  the sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
volatility of our stock price could adversely affect stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of quarterly variations in our operating results  cyclical nature of defense spending  interest rate changes  changes in the market s expectations about our operating results  our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period  
table of contents changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the defense industry in general  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes in laws and regulations affecting our business  material announcements by us or our competitors  sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors  executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur  general economic and political conditions such as recessions and acts of war or terrorism  and other matters discussed in risk factors 
fluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of an investor s investment in our company 
we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of common stock appreciates 
we currently do not plan to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements  earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
agreements governing future indebtedness will likely contain similar restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends 
consequently  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in the common stock of our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your common stock at a profit 
in addition  under the certificate of designations for our series a convertible preferred stock  an affirmative vote at a meeting duly called or the written consent without a meeting of the holders of such preferred stock representing at least a majority of then outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock is required for us to pay dividends or any other distribution on our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and  therefore  depress the trading price of our stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of percent of our stockholders  provide that only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board of directors  require super majority voting to amend our bylaws or specified provisions in our certificate of incorporation  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt  limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit common stockholder action by written consent  which requires all common stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  
table of contents provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt  amend  or repeal our bylaws  subject to the rights of our stockholders to do the same by super majority vote of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these and other provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  and may limit the ability of stockholders to remove our current management or approve transactions that our stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
shares of stock issuable pursuant to our stock options  warrant and series a convertible preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of april   we had outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock under our incentive compensation plan and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
in addition  we have  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our incentive compensation plan and  shares reserved for issuance upon the conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock 
our outstanding warrants and series a convertible preferred stock also contain provisions that increase  subject to limited exceptions  the number of shares of common stock that may be acquired upon the conversion or exercise of such securities in the event we issue or are deemed to have issued shares of our common stock at a per share price that is less than their then existing exercise price  in the case of the warrants  and conversion price  in the case of the series a convertible preferred stock 
the exercise of the stock options and warrants would further reduce a stockholder s percentage voting and ownership interest 
further  the stock options and warrants are likely to be exercised when our common stock is trading at a price that is higher than the exercise price of these options and warrants  and we would be able to obtain a higher price for our common stock than we will receive under such options and warrants 
the exercise  or potential exercise  of these options and warrants or conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional financing 
future sales  or the availability for sale  of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
we have registered shares of our common stock that are subject to outstanding stock options  or reserved for issuance under our stock option plan  which shares can generally be freely sold in the public market upon issuance 
pursuant to a settlement with the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock in may  we also have registered the resale of up to  shares of our common stock and intend to register an additional  shares of our common stock held by such preferred stockholders

item selected financial data we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and are not required to provide the information required under this item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in risk factors in item a 
overview we are a defense and security products company engaged in three business areas customized transparent and opaque armor solutions for construction equipment and tactical and non tactical transport vehicles used by the military  architectural hardening and perimeter defense  such as bullet and blast resistant transparent armor  walls and doors  as well as vehicle anti ram barriers such as bollards  steel gates and steel wedges that deploy out of the ground  and tactical training products and services consisting of our live fire interactive t tactical training system and our american institute for defense and tactical studies 
we primarily serve the defense market and our sales are highly concentrated within the us government 
our customers include various branches of the us military through the us department of defense and to a much lesser extent other us government  law enforcement and correctional agencies as well as private sector customers 
our recent historical revenues have been generated primarily from a limited number of large contracts and a series of purchase orders from a single customer 
to continue expanding our business  we are seeking to broaden our customer base and to diversify our product and service offerings 
our strategy to increase our revenue  grow our company and increase stockholder value involves the following key elements increase exposure to military platforms in the us and internationally  develop strategic alliances and form strategic partnerships with original equipment manufacturers oems  capitalize on increased homeland security requirements and non military platforms  focus on an advanced research and development program to capitalize on increased demand for new armor materials  and pursue strategic acquisitions 
we are pursuing each of these growth strategies simultaneously  and expect one or more of them to result in additional revenue opportunities within the next months 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues by fulfilling orders under master contracts awarded by branches of the united states military  law enforcement and corrections agencies and private companies involved in the defense market and other customer purchase orders 
under these contracts and purchase orders  we provide customized transparent and opaque armor products for transport and construction vehicles used by the military  group 
table of contents protection kits and spare parts 
we also derive revenues from sales of our architectural hardening and perimeter defense products  which we sometimes refer to as physical security products 
to date  we have generated nominal revenues from our t and other training solutions and we are evaluating the continued offering of such training products and services and expect to continue that process over the next several months 
as noted in the section entitled business backlog  we have million of contract backlog as of december   which we estimate will be filled in accordingly  in order to maintain our current revenue levels and to generate revenue growth  we will need to win more contracts with the us government and other commercial entities  achieve significant penetration into critical infrastructure and public safety protection markets  and successfully further develop our relationships with oem s and strategic partners 
notwithstanding the possible significant troop reductions in afghanistan and iraq  we expect that demand in those countries for armored military construction vehicles will continue in order to repair significant war damage and for nation building purposes 
in addition  we are exploring interest in armored construction equipment in other countries with mine infested regions 
we continue to aggressively bid on projects and are in preliminary talks with a number of international firms to pursue long term government and commercial contracts  including with respect to homeland security 
while no assurances can be given that we will obtain a sufficient number of contracts or that any contracts we do obtain will be of significant value or duration  we are confident that we will continue to have the opportunity to bid and win contracts as we have in cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of parts  direct labor and overhead expenses incurred for the fulfillment of orders under contract 
these costs are charged to expense upon completion and acceptance of an order 
costs of revenue also includes the costs of prototyping and engineering  which are expensed upon completion of an order as well 
these costs are included as costs of revenue because they are incurred to modify products based upon government specifications and are reimbursable costs within the contract 
these costs for the production of goods under contract are expensed when they are complete 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer supplies  depreciation for computer equipment and office supplies based on personnel assigned to the job 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
sales and marketing 
expenses related to sales and marketing consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  trade shows and related travel 
sales and marketing costs are charged to expense as incurred 
as we have implemented various cost cutting measures  we expect that in  sales and marketing expenses will decrease 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred as we perform ongoing evaluations of materials and processes for existing products  as well as the development of new products and processes 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new protections products  but will remain relatively consistent or decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for finance  accounting  administrative  legal  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenues due to cost cutting measures implemented at the end of general and administrative salaries 
general and administrative salaries expenses consist of compensation for the officers  and it  design and engineering personnel 
we expect that in  general and administrative salaries expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenues due to the cost cutting measures  which include reduction in labor costs  implemented at the end of 
table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue and cost recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  which states that revenue is realized and earned when all of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
under this provision  revenue is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the order 
we recognize revenue and report profits from purchases orders filled under master contracts when an order is complete  as defined below 
purchase orders received under master contracts may extend for periods in excess of one year 
purchase order costs are accumulated as deferred assets and billings and or cash received are charged to a deferred revenue account during the periods of construction 
however  no revenues  costs or profits are recognized in operations until the period upon completion of the order 
an order is considered complete when all costs  except insignificant items  have been incurred and  the installation or product is operating according to specification or the shipment has been accepted by the customer 
provisions for estimated contract losses are made in the period that such losses are determined 
as of december   there were no such provisions made 
all costs associated with uncompleted purchase orders under contract are recorded on the balance sheet as a deferred asset called costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
upon completion of a purchase order  such associated costs are then reclassified from the balance sheet to the statement of operations as costs of revenue 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation consists of stock or options issued to employees  directors and contractors for services rendered 
we account for the stock issued using the estimated current market price per share at the date of issuance 
such cost is recorded as compensation in our statement of operations at the date of issuance 
in december  we adopted our incentive compensation plan pursuant to which we have issued and intend to issue stock based compensation from time to time  in the form of stock  stock options and other equity based awards 
our policy for accounting for such compensation in the form of stock options is as follows we have adopted the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
in accordance with asc  we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
in  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 as codified in asc  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for asc because we have only recently become a public entity  we will have a limited trading history 
the expected term of an award is based on the simplified method allowed by asc  whereby the expected term is equal to the period of time between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award 
the risk free interest rate will be based on the rate on us treasury zero coupon issues with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying a dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future and accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
changes in these assumptions can affect the estimated fair value of options granted and the related compensation expense which may significantly impact our results of operations in future periods 

table of contents stock based compensation expense recognized will be based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest 
we will apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
we recognized  and  in stock compensation expense during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
fair value measurements 
we have adopted the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments 
asc was effective for financial assets and liabilities on january  the statement deferred the implementation of the provisions of asc relating to certain non financial assets and liabilities until january  fair value  as defined in asc  is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants  whether using an in use or an in exchange valuation premise 
the fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance  which includes  among other things  the company s credit risk 
valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories the market approach  the income approach  and the cost approach 
the selection and application of one or more of the techniques requires significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability  the principal or most advantageous market in which participants would transact for the asset or liability and the quality and availability of inputs 
inputs to valuation techniques are classified as either observable or unobservable within the following hierarchy level inputs these inputs come from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs these inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable  for an asset or liability 
this includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level inputs these are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which require the company s own assumptions 
series a convertible preferred stock  investor warrants and placement agent warrants series a convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock or series a preferred is mandatorily redeemable on april  and convertible into shares of common stock at per share subject to adjustment should we issue future common stock at a lesser price 
as a result we elected to record the hybrid instrument  preferred stock and conversion option together  at fair value 
subsequent reporting period changes in fair value are to be reported in the statement of operations 
the proceeds from the issuance of the series a preferred and accompanying common stock warrants  net of direct costs including the fair value of warrants issued to the placement agent in connection with the transaction  must be allocated to the instruments based upon relative fair value upon issuance as they must be measured initially at fair value 
therefore  after the initial recording of the series a preferred based upon net proceeds received  the carrying value of the series a preferred must be adjusted to the fair value at the date of issuance  with the difference recorded as a gain or loss 
on march   the date of initial issuance  we recorded a derivative liability of million 
on april   the date of the second issuance  we recorded a derivative liability of million 
these liabilities were subsequently adjusted to fair value as of december  and  which resulted in a loss of  million and a gain of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the series a preferred liability was million and million  respectively 

table of contents derivative warrants investor warrants 
the warrants issued to the investors in the series a preferred or investor warrants meet the criteria under asc derivatives and hedging 
under asc  the warrants are recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance  with changes in the value fair value recognized as a gain or loss as they occur 
on march   the date of initial issuance  we recorded a derivative liability of million 
on april   the date of the second issuance  we recorded a derivative liability of million 
as of december   the investor warrant liability was as such warrants were no longer outstanding 
we recorded a loss of approximately  on the change in fair value in the statement of operations for the year ended december  on may  we entered into a settlement agreement  waiver and amendment with the series a holders or settlement agreement pursuant to which  among other things  the warrants were amended to reduce the exercise price thereof from per share to per share 
the warrants were exercised in full during may and june  and the investor warrant liability was accordingly reclassified to additional paid in capital 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources series a convertible preferred stock below 
placement agent warrants 
the warrants issued to the placement agent with respect to the sale of the series a preferred and investor warrants or placement agent warrants were accounted for as a transaction cost associated with the issuance of the series a preferred 
the placement agent warrants are recorded at fair value at the date of issuance 
under eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  as codified in asc  we satisfy the criteria for classification of the placement agent warrants as equity on the date of issuance 
we have recorded the corresponding amount recorded as a deferred financing cost since the series a preferred and investor warrants are classified as liabilities and are amortized as additional financing costs over the term of the series a preferred using the interest method 
at the date of each issuance  we recorded million and million in deferred financing costs 
effective january   we were required to analyze these instruments in accordance with eitf as codified in asc based on our analysis  the placement agent warrants include price protection provisions whereby the exercise price could be adjusted upon certain financing transaction at a lower price per share and could no longer be viewed as indexed to our common stock 
as a result  we accounted for these warrants as a derivative under asc and recorded as liabilities at fair value on january  of approximately  the fair value of these warrants was approximately  as of december  and we recorded gain of approximately  on the change in fair value in the statement of operations for the year ended december  warrants and warrants 
upon issuance  warrants issued to the placement agent with respect to our sale of common stock in warrants and warrants met the requirements for equity classification set forth in eitf issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock  and sfas no 
as codified in asc however  effective january   we were required to analyze these instruments in accordance with eitf as codified in asc based on our analysis  the warrants and warrants include price protection provisions whereby the exercise price could be adjusted upon certain financing transaction at a lower price per share and could no longer be viewed as indexed to our common stock 
as a result  the warrants and warrants were accounted for as derivatives under asc and recorded as liabilities at fair value on january  of  the fair value of these warrants was approximately  as of december  and we recorded gain of approximately  on the change in fair value in the statement of operations for the year ended december  debt extinguishment 
we accounted for the effects of the may  settlement agreement see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidelines enumerated in eitf issue no 
debtor s accounting for a modification of exchange of debt instruments as codified in asc asc provides that a substantial modification of terms in an existing debt instrument should be accounted for like  and reported in the same manner as  an extinguishment of debt 

table of contents asc further provides that the modification of a debt instrument by a debtor and a creditor in a non troubled debt situation is deemed to have been accomplished with debt instruments that are substantially different if the present value of cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument is at least ten percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument at the date of the modifications 
we evaluated the modification of the payment terms and the related adjustment to financial instruments to determine whether these modifications resulted in the issuance of a substantially different instrument 
we determined after giving effect to the changes in the due dates of payments and the consideration paid to the debt holders  in the form of reduced conversion and exercise prices  that we had issued substantially different debt instruments  which resulted in a constructive extinguishment of the original debt instrument 
accordingly  we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of  which represented the difference in the carrying value of the old debt and fair value of the new debt 
the debt instrument charge is included in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  consolidated results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for from continuing operations were million  an increase of million or  from revenues of million for the increase in revenues from to was due primarily to increased order fulfillment under our marine corp contract no 
m d during the year ended december  as compared to  including the orders that were delayed from the fourth quarter of into the first and second quarters of the revenue increase also was due to additional sales generated from our physical security product business for the year ended december  of million an increase of million or over revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues from our discontinued operations for the year ended december  were million 
there were no revenues generated from discontinued operations during the year ended december  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over cost of revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributed to additional production costs incurred for the year ended december  resulting from increased sales from our physical security product business and increased production under the marine corps contract mentioned above as well as increased sales of certain of our cpks  which have lower gross margins than our other cpks  as compared to the year ended december  cost of revenue from discontinued operation for the year ended december  was million 
there were no costs of revenues generated from discontinued operations for the year ended december  gross profit margin 
the gross profit margin from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit margin percentage from continuing operations from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was due primarily to the following significantly higher sales under our marine corps contract mentioned above in and of product with lower gross profit margins  and an aggressive sales program with oem vendors of our armor solutions that resulted in a lower gross profit margin for such armor solutions in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  and december  remained unchanged at million  respectively 
although we expected to increase 
table of contents our sales and marketing as our revenues increased for  during the second half of  we have sought to keep such expenses relatively low as we continue to monitor our costs 
there were no sales or marketing expenses for discontinued operations for the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  over research and development expenses of approximately  for the year ended december  during  we incurred higher research and development costs associated with additional testing of our cpks and to a lesser extent  testing and improvement of existing products  such as glass and composite armors  and continued work on our products in development  such as helmets 
there were no research and development expenses for discontinued operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  over general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to our compliance efforts with regard to section of the sarbanes oxley act of million and additional costs relating to professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for discontinued operations were  for the year ended december  there were no such expenses incurred during the year ended december  general and administrative salaries expense 
general and administrative salaries expense for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to no bonuses being earned by our company in we incurred no salary expense with regard to our discontinued operations during the years ended december  and as of december   there were employees that were classified as general and administrative personnel  versus employees as of december  depreciation expense 
depreciation expense from continuing operations was approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million  or was the result of our higher property and equipment balance as of december  versus december  the increase was the result of depreciation of additional leasehold improvements and equipment associated with the expansion of our facility during the second half of  property and equipment purchased in and for our hicksville facility and physical security product business  and t equipment 
other income and expense 
as a result of our agreement to sell our series a convertible preferred stock and related investor warrants to purchase common stock and the subsequent settlement agreement that reduced the exercise price of the investor warrants from to  we incurred losses upon the valuation of the series a convertible preferred stock 
such valuation took into account the features  rights and obligations of the series a convertible preferred stock  which ultimately resulted in a higher fair value than the proceeds received 
since the series a convertible preferred stock and related investor warrants are required to be recorded at fair value  we recorded a loss on such securities 
we experienced a loss on adjustment of fair value with respect to our series a convertible preferred stock of approximately million and a gain on adjustment of approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also recognized gains of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively on our warrants classified as liabilities 
in addition  we incurred interest expense  including interest associated with the amortization of the deferred financing costs  issuance of dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock and amortization of the discount on the series a convertible preferred stock  of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also had a loss on deemed extinguishment of debt related to our series a convertible preferred stock for the year ended december  of million 
loss from discontinued operations we had no loss from operations of our discontinued division for the year ended december  the loss from operations of our discontinued division was  for the year ended december  we 
table of contents recorded a loss from disposal of our discontinued division of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity during the year ended december  have come from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were net accounts receivable of million  costs in excess of billings of million and the sale of accounts receivable under accounts receivable purchase agreement with republic capital access rca  of which rca has not received payment from our customers for million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were net accounts receivable of approximately million and costs in excess of billings of million 
the primary sources of our liquidity during came from operations and the proceeds from the sale of our series a convertible preferred stock 
we believe that our current net accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings together with our expected cash flows from operations  ability to sell accounts receivable to rca as described below will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures at least through december   except with respect to mandatory redemption of million in stated value of our series a convertible preferred stock at april   extended from december   pursuant to a waiver agreement which we entered into with the series a holders on april  we currently are seeking to raise capital or obtain access to capital sufficient to permit us to effect such redemption 
if we are unable to timely raise capital or obtain access to a credit facility or other source of funds sufficient to fund such redemption  our cash flow could be adversely affected and our business significantly harmed 
in addition  restrictions imposed pursuant to the general corporation law of the state of delaware the dgcl  our state of incorporation  would prohibit us from satisfying such redemption if we lack sufficient surplus  as such term is defined under the dgcl 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided in operating activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of changes in our operating assets and liabilities of million  including changes in accounts receivable  cost in excess of billing  prepaid expense  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the changes in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billing of million and million  respectively  reflect the decreases in receivables from completed projects and costs incurred on projects in process as of december  our prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased million due to amounts paid in advance in connection with prepayment of legal expense  interest expense  tradeshow related expense and insurance 
as of december   we experienced a decrease in accounts receivable of million  due to increased collections during the increase in our costs in excess of billings of million as of december   reflects increases in projects in process as of december  our prepaid expenses increased  due to amounts paid in advance in connection with our intent to enter the public market and obtain outside financing 
in addition  the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflect the related increase in expenses incurred  with no funds paid out 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million available to reduce future taxable income 
in the future  we may utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and would begin making cash tax payments at that time 
in addition  the limitations on utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and other minimum taxes may also increase our overall tax obligations 
we expect that if we generate taxable income and or we are not allowed to use net operating loss carryforwards  our cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet our income tax obligations 
net cash used in investing activities
