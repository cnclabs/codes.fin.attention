item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur  it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclical changes caused by general global and industry conditions 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
furthermore  a general economic downturn in a particular country or on an international scale could reduce the overall sales within our industry  thereby likely reducing our sales 
 we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create a surplus capacity of the goods that we sell  which might cause us to either lose sales or lower the prices of our goods 
actions by our competitors and any surplus capacity could cause our sales and profits to decline  affecting our operating results and financial condition 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely affect our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
we have raw material availability issues at our memphis and americana specialty fiber plants 
we have the option to import cotton linters purchases for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production in order to minimize the impact of current constraints on north american cotton fiber availability 
we have limited production at our americana  brazil and memphis specialty fibers facilities because of raw material constraints 
this raw material availability constraint will limit growth and increase our production costs 
energy and chemical costs which had increased substantially in recent years  resulting in increased production costs for our products  have recently moderated 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck  rail and international shipping could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
an increase in international shipping rates or fuel surcharges or a reduction in the availability of vessels could negatively impact our costs and our ability to provide products to our international customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 
risks related to our business exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
our indebtedness levels could adversely affect us 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants and those contained in the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our debt level and the various covenants contained in the indenture related to our senior notes and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors  and our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to pay principal of and interest on our senior notes  to service our other debt and to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results  actions that we take  their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy 
actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining  upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading 
downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets  increase our cost of financing  and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 
any of our manufacturing facilities  or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  an equipment failure  a chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  labor difficulties  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hurricanes or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  governmental regulations  and other operational problems 
we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and anti dumping duties for exported products 
we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and anti dumping duty applications 
it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs  or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future 
these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial results and financial condition 
the impacts of climate related initiatives  at the international  federal and state levels  remain uncertain at this time 
currently  there are numerous international  federal and state level initiatives and proposals addressing domestic and global climate issues 
within the us  most of these proposals would regulate and or tax  in one fashion or another  the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere  and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more clean energy 
for example  in the us house of representatives passed the markey waxman bill hr  which would establish a so called cap and trade regime and new permitting requirements to regulate greenhouse gas generation  as well as provide an incentive for the production and use of clean energy 
to date  the us senate has not passed any comparable legislation 
in sum  we believe that the potential for climate change legislation on the federal level is unknown 
in addition  in late  the us epa issued an endangerment finding under the clear air act caa with respect to carbon dioxide  which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the caa and have significant ramifications for us and the industry in general 
on the international front  the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen  which took place in december  did not result in any significant progress toward a binding agreement to replace the kyoto protocol  which expires in we are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel 
we believe that our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel 
our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
as of august   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida and memphis  tennessee 
our foley plant s labor agreement is in effect through april  the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  at our canadian facility  the labor agreement expired on june   but was automatically extended until negotiations are completed 
employee representation is provided by a national union for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and a works council at our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumberton and king  north carolina are not unionized 
the failure to renegotiate labor agreements in a timely manner could lead to a curtailment or stoppage of work at our factories 
if we negotiated a labor agreement on unfavorable terms  our production costs will increase 
a reduction in production or increasing the costs of production would lower our profits and harm our business 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely affect our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
such environmental laws and regulations at the federal level include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  the clean air act of  as amended  the clean water act of  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  the toxic substances control act of  as amended  and the safe drinking water act of  as amended 
these environmental regulatory programs are primarily admin istered by the us environmental protection agency epa 
in addition  the individual states and foreign countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt in the future equivalent or more stringent environmental laws and regulations or have enacted their own parallel environmental programs 
we closely monitor our environmental compliance with current environmental requirements and believe that we are in substantial compliance 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements  including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions  such as emissions of greenhouse gases  and general permitting requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
we also expect that we will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
any failure on our part to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to penalties or other sanctions that could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we cannot currently assess  however  the impact that more stringent environmental requirements may have on our operations or capital expenditure requirements 
we do not anticipate that c apital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance will have a material effect on our earnings during fiscal year compliance with recently passed legislation may adversely affect our business 
in march  congress passed the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  the acts 
among other things  the acts contain provisions that will affect employer sponsored health care plans  impose excise taxes on certain plans  and reduce the tax benefits available to employers that receive the medicare part d subsidy 
we are currently reviewing provisions of the acts and their impact on our company sponsored plans 
we are currently unable to estimate costs associated with compliance with the acts 
because approximately of our sales are to customers outside the united states  we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in approximately countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united states represented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the us dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our industries and business and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products  capacity changes  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  our growth rate and our competitors growth rates  the financial market and general economic conditions  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors or our industry generally  or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  and changes in accounting principles 
in addition  there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in our industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could result in substantial costs and would divert management s attention and resources

as of june   the americana plant operated at about of its capacity 
nonwovens plants the stated capacity of airlaid nonwovens machines is based upon an assumed mix of products 
the flexible nature of airlaid technology allows for a wide range of materials to be produced 
machine production capability has typically been lower than the stated capacity  often by factors of  when adjusted to reflect the actual product mix 
based on current product mix  utilization of our airlaid machines worldwide  as of june   was approximately of their capacity 
delta plant 
the delta plant is located in delta  british columbia on a acre industrial park site and has a total capacity of approximately  annual metric tons of airlaid nonwovens  based on current production mix from two production lines

all of the facilities located in the united states are pledged as collateral for certain debt agreements 
we believe that our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials manufacturing facilities and administrative buildings are adequate to meet current operating demands 
item legal proceedings we are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess the probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
we believe the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results from operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies and estimates 
unless otherwise indicated  references to a year eg  refers to our fiscal year ended june of that year 
executive summary we manufacture and distribute value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  cigarette filters  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
our key focus areas over the next twelve months include maximizing cash flow  optimizing capacity utilization  investing in the foley energy project  identifying new bio energy initiatives that support profitable  sustainable growth  and accelerating the rate of change to a lean enterprise culture 
we plan to take a balanced approach in allocating capital between debt reduction  investment in high rate of return projects  and returning cash to shareholders 
our financial results were much improved 
toward the end of  we began to recover from the deepest economic recession since the great depression  which had had a noticeable impact on our markets beginning in october this improving trend continued and accelerated throughout while not satisfied with our overall results  we are pleased with the consistent improvement each quarter over the course of the year 
the versatility of our wood specialty facility allowed us to focus on other specialty markets to remain sold out at the beginning of the year after taking some market downtime in the third quarter of as our key markets returned to full strength  we continued to improve our product mix throughout the year 
our new office in beijing  china opened in january is adding value by increasing sales of our products in china 
net sales for were million compared to million in  with the specialty fibers segment market sales excluding intercompany sales down and sales in the nonwoven materials segment up 
higher shipment volume had a positive million impact on sales compared to  while lower selling prices and unfavorable mix reduced sales by million 
market shipment volume was up for our specialty fibers segment and for our nonwovens segment 
while selling prices have been trending up over the past several quarters  total year average prices are down year over year by about overall 
this was partly due to lower fluff pulp prices and partly due to reduced prices for higher purity specialty grades and nonwovens products reflecting lower input costs 
operating income for was million compared to a loss of million in a large part of the million improvement is explained by two items last year s million non cash goodwill impairment charge and an increase of million in income from the alternative fuel mixture credit in total gross margin increased by million in spite of only a slight million increase in sales revenue  largely due to the return to profitability of our memphis cotton specialty fibers plant and higher sales and improved margins in our nonwovens segment 
total gross margin for our wood specialty products was down about million year over year due to sales mix and the million impact of a power outage and voltage surge at our florida specialty fibers facility in june 
 gross margin as a percentage of sales improved from to 
partially offsetting the improvement in gross margin were restructuring costs of million related to headcount reductions required to i reduce selling  research and administrative expenses  ii to reduce costs at our memphis plant based on reduced capacity utilization  and iii to restructure our ultrafiber sales force 
total headcount enrollment as of june  was  compared to  one year earlier and  two years earlier 
selling  research and administrative sra expenses of million were up million over the prior year due to higher employee bonus accruals  but sra expenses are expected to drop to the million range in as a result of these restructuring actions 
net earnings for of million  or per diluted share  were up million or per diluted share compared to last year s goodwill impairment charge accounted for of this improvement and the increase in income from the alternative fuel mixture credit accounted for an additional 
excluding these two items along with restructuring costs  early debt extinguishment costs and investment tax credits related to prior period expenditures  adjusted eps reconciled below improved from per diluted share in to per share in the impact of the improved gross margin net of higher sra expenses mentioned above added to earnings 
net interest expense for the year was down million or  adding an additional to eps for the year  but a higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rates on income excluding the goodwill impairment charge and income from alternative fuel mixture credit were in compared to in net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million  including million from the alternative fuel mixture credit  enabling us to reduce total debt to million on june  we have made significant progress reducing our debt and improving our balance sheet 
reducing total debt by million this year  retiring million of bonds and million of our bonds were significant milestones for buckeye 
net interest expense for the year was million  compared to million in most of the reduction in interest expense came from lower total debt  but also from exchanging and bond debt for our banking facility debt of libor plus 
a top priority continues to be generating free cash flow 
our debt target is to be i n a range of ebitda 
on july  we received our us federal income tax refund of million 
we used this refund to reduce the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
after this reduction  our debt to ebitda ratio was below the target range 
there will be times when we will be well below that range  however  this provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of potential opportunities to improve shareholder value 
our capital spending for the year just completed was million 
this included million in spending on the florida energy project  which is on schedule to be complete with full startup in the first quarter of incentives received in related to spending to date on this project included a million state of florida grant received in the first quarter and million in section federal investment tax credits received as part of the tax refund in june we expect to see some benefits of the project beginning as early as the second quarter of over the past two fiscal years  the alternative fuel mixtures credits afmc  which expired on december   have generated significant net income and cash flow for buckeye  and have allowed us to reach our debt reduction goals much more quickly than would have otherwise been the case 
during this period  the afmc generated million in operating income and added million in net income or per share 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million during this period 
on a cumulative basis through july including the receipt of the tax refund  the afmc has generated total cash flow of million for buckeye since we began earning these credits in february now  based on a new irs chief counsel advice memorandum issued in j uly addressing the applicability of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credit cbpc to black liquor in calendar year  we anticipate filing claims for additional tax benefits under that program 
we received a cellulosic biofuel producer registration number which allowed us to amend our tax return for the year ended june  and claim approximately million of cbpc on black liquor produced and used in our business from january  until february  before we began mixing diesel with black liquor to qualify for the afmc 
we expect to be able to realize this million through a combination of tax refunds and reductions in quarterly estimated tax payments by the end of december we could also convert alternative fuel mixture credits for gallons of black liquor produced and used by us from february  through december   the time period that we mixed diesel with black liquor to claim alternative fuel mixture cash refunds and alternative fuel mixture income tax credits 
for any gallon of fuel  the alternative fuel mixture credit may be exchanged for the cbpc by repaying the credit  with interest  for any gallon of fuel for which the credit was claimed and received by us 
tax returns would have to be amended to claim the cbpc 
converting the alternative fuel mixture credits refunds to cbpc for all gallons of the black liquor mixed with diesel would produce an additional benefit of approximately million  less interest paid to the irs  and is dependent on our future taxable income for the tax years ending june  through june  we are currently analyzing this opportunity based on the recent irs guidance and will recognize any benefits in the financial statements for the first quarter of on august  the board of directors announced our first ever quarterly dividend of 
per share  a milestone for buckeye 
with approximately million shares outstanding  this will initially represent a million annual distribution of cash to shareholders 
this in essence is cash flow that was formerly used to reduce our debt and pay our interest expense and now will be used to return cash to shareholders 
our objectives for returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends are to increase shareholder returns and to broaden our shareholder base 
we expect that buckeye will continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to pay this dividend and grow it over time while also continuing to invest in high return projects and growth opportunities

we also experienced lower volume in cotton specialty products  as we reduced our production to match raw material availability 
gross margin in versus improved by million on the increased sales volume and increased as a percent of net sales from to 
our costs were down significantly year over year  but reductions in cost were mostly offset by lower selling prices and unfavorable sales mix 
we experienced lower raw material prices million  primarily for cotton linter fibers and fluff pulp  although prices for both started increasing in the second half of and have continued to rise in the first quarter of in addition  chemical prices were lower by million and energy prices were lower by million 
direct cost spending was up about million year over year in spite of significant reductions at our memphis specialty cotton fibers plant mainly due to higher shipment volume s  increased maintenance spending and higher bonus accruals 
only million of this increase in direct cost spending was due to the june power outage 
the global economic downturn had an unfavorable impact on the demand for many of our products in net sales decreased for versus  primarily due to lower shipment volume in both the specialty fibers and nonwoven materials segments 
lower shipment volume accounted for approximately million of the decline 
higher selling prices for our products partially offset the lower volume  with selling prices being up approximately on average compared to million 
gross margin was lower for versus by million 
lower shipment volume and associated market related production downtime resulted in lost margin on reduced shipments and higher costs due to lower capacity utilization rates 
overall selling price increases more than offset increases in raw material  chemical and energy prices over that same period 
selling  research and administrative expenses increased million in due mainly to higher bonus and stock compensation expense which offset the impact of lower employment 
selling  research and administrative expenses decreased million in as a percentage of net sales these costs increased to in versus in and in based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  during the three months ended march   we completed this analysis 
we concluded that there was no change to the impairment loss of million we recognized at december  since this goodwill impairment charge is non cash  it did not affect our liquidity or financial covenants 
we recorded million and million in alternative fuel mixture credits  which were net of expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations for the years and  respectively 
during and we received million and million  respectively  in cash refunds through the filing of periodic excise tax refund claims 
we claimed million as income tax credits on our tax return and million as income tax credits on our tax return which reduced our cash taxes in by an additional million 
we have treated the credits received in cash as taxable income and the income tax credits as non taxable income 
the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to audit by the irs 
the credit expired on december  further discussion of revenue and operating trends can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the goodwill impairment may also be found in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment consists of our chemical cellulose  customized fibers and fluff pulp product lines which are cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
the nonwovens materials segment consists of our airlaid plants and our converting plant 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administrative expenses to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
 we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  the impact of goodwill impairment loss  alternative fuel mixture credits  amortization of intangibles  and unallocated at risk and stock based compensation

fluff pulp pricing decreased by per ton 
prices for high end specialty wood grades were down  primarily due to cost pass through provisions included in our annual sales agreements 
prices for specialty cotton grades were down reflecting lower costs for cotton linters 
unfavorable product sales mix also contributed to the lower sales 
shipment volume for the segment was up  as shipment volume for specialty wood fibers increased by  but shipment volume was lower by for specialty cotton fibers 
operating income for improved by million compared to in spite of a million drop in sales revenue  largely due to the return to profitability of our memphis cotton specialty fibers plant 
our gross margin for this plant improved by million due to a combination of lower raw material costs  chemical costs  energy costs and headcount and other direct cost reductions  although as a percentage of sales  it is still below the average for the total specialty fibers segment 
total gross margin for our wood specialty products was down about million year over year due to sales mix and the million impact of a power outage and voltage surge at our florida specialty fibers facility in june 
operating margin as a percentage of sales for the specialty fibers segment improved fr om to 
we also saw a reduction in finished goods inventory in the specialty fibers segment  partly due to  tons of lost production in june at the foley plant due to the power outage 
inventories are currently below sustainable levels both at the foley plant and at the memphis plant  and will have to be rebuilt during the first six months of specialty fibers net sales were down  primarily due to lower shipment volume for versus as the global economic downturn impacted demand for many of our products 
shipment volume for the specialty fibers segment was down compared to  with specialty wood fibers shipments off and specialty cotton fibers off 
specialty wood fibers sales were most negatively impacted by reduced demand for fluff pulp and specialty wood grades used in automotive and construction applications 
partially offsetting the lower volume were higher prices of approximately on our wood specialty products excluding fluff and on our cotton specialty products 
fluff pulp prices decreased approximately per ton compared to operating income for versus was unfavorably affected by the lower sales volume and lower production volume 
higher raw material costs million  primarily due to the increase in cotton fibers  higher chemical costs million  higher energy costs million and higher transportation costs million contributed to the lower operating income 
the higher specialty fibers prices  lower direct cost spending and favorable exchange rates in brazil partially offset the unfavorable items

this trend of expanding margins during times of falling raw material costs reversed course in mid year as fluff pulp prices started to rapidly escalate  with operating margin for the fourth quarter down to 
nonwoven materials sales decreased in versus  primarily due to lower shipment volume million and a weakening of the euro versus the us dollar million 
higher pricing of million partially offset the impact of lower volumes 
shipment volumes for the nonwoven materials segment were down 
part of this reduction was because we did not completely replace the business lost in january and part was due to the global recession 
shipment volume for our airlaid nonwovens products used in wipes  however  our largest product category  was up year over year by about 
selling prices were up about on the average compared to the prior year 
operating income decreased million for versus the impact of lower sales volumes  unfavorable product mix and higher raw material prices were partially offset by higher selling prices  lower transportation costs  a weaker canadian dollar and reduced selling  research  and administrative spending 
corporate our intercompany net sales elimination represents intercompany sales from our florida and memphis specialty fiber facilities to our airlaid nonwovens plants 
intercompany sales were down million from to primarily due to reduced shipments and selling prices for fluff pulp shipped from our florida mill to our airlaid nonwovens plants

the total cost of this program was million and was completed during the fourth quarter of as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated and employees were transferred from selling  research and administrative positions to management positions at our florida facility 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus interest expense decreased due to debt reduction of million and a reduction of approximately basis points in our average interest rate 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus this improvement was the result of lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates during in addition  approximately million more interest was capitalized on long term projects in versus gain loss on early extinguishment of debt costs during  we used borrowings under our credit facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes 
as a result of this extinguishment  we recorded a million non cash gain which was the net of the deferred financing costs  offset by the remaining unamortized interest rate swap early termination fee 
we also used cash and borrowings to redeem million of our notes

income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in and in during and  we claimed the alternative fuel mixture credits as cash refunds through the filing of periodic excise tax refund claims and as income tax credits on the federal income tax returns filed for the and tax years 
for purposes of calculating federal and state income taxes  we treat the credits claimed as cash refunds of excise tax as taxable income and the credits claimed on the federal income tax return as nontaxable income 
in and  we recorded tax benefits of million and million  respectively  due to the nontaxable nature of the alternative fuel mixture credits claimed on the federal income tax return 
this tax benefit was much larger in than in because only of the credits were claimed as cash refunds of excise tax treated as taxable inc ome compared to in the american recovery and reinvestment act of expanded the irc section energy investment tax credit to include qualified property for facilities producing electricity using open loop biomass 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of million relating to this tax credit  of which million relates to expenditures prior to june  and million relates to expenditures 
we expect to realize continuing benefits from the energy investment tax credit which will reduce our effective tax rate over the next several years based on planned spending on energy projects at our foley mill 
on december  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge and we recognized a tax benefit of million in connection with the goodwill impairment charge 
effective july  germany reduced its tax rates resulting in a million net tax benefit for related to remeasurement of german deferred tax liabilities based on reversal of temporary differences 
on july   we adopted the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded an adjustment of million to reduce retained earnings at july  at adoption and june   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled million 
we include interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income before income taxes 
all unrecogniz ed tax benefits at adoption would affect the effective tax rate  if recognized 
during  as a result of a state audit  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million and our related interest and penalties by million 
during  we increased unrecognized tax benefits by million related to federal income taxes 
the balance in unrecognized tax benefits and our related interest and penalties is million and million  respectively 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during with the million debt reduction 
we plan to take a balanced approach in allocating capital between debt reduction  investment in high rate of return projects  and returning cash to shareholders 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing a senior secured credit facility and senior notes 
our senior secured credit facility and senior notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june   and believe we will continue to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  long term debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june   as compared to at june  and at june  on july   we established a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july  we used the proceeds from this credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former credit facility plus fees and expenses 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility is grid based pricing  related to our total leverage ratio  at the agent s prime rate plus to or a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
we also used proceeds from this facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes  to redeem million of the notes in mid september  and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
our credit facility contains covenants customary for financing of this type 
the financial covenants include maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
during and at june   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facility 
on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and we had million borrowing capacity on our credit facility 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranges from to per annum based on a grid related to our leverage ratio 
total costs for the issuance of the facility were approximately million and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the facility 
on june  we amended the notes to permit the redemption  repurchase or retirement of subordinated indebtedness  including our then existing notes  up to sixteen months prior to maturity  four months earlier than was allowed by the indenture prior to amendment 
on july  we redeemed the remaining million of our notes using borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
on july  we received our us federal income tax refund of million 
we used this refund to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
on september   we called the remaining  of the notes for redemption on october  these notes will be redeemed using borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the next twenty four months 
treasury stock at june   a total of million shares have been repurchased under authorizations by our board of directors to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
repurchased shares  if any  are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
we did not repurchase any shares during but during and  we repurchased and million shares  respectively

in addition  working capital was reduced by million during as reductions in finished goods inventory and increased payables more than offset an increase in accounts receivable 
the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily due to the million in cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits during the year  which offset the negative impact of reduced sales revenue and gross margin 
cash flow in also benefitted from lower inventory levels  partially offset by lower accounts payable and current liabilities 
the inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of raw cotton linters and lower prices on raw materials at all sites 
the decrease in accounts payable was also due to the lower inventory levels and lower prices for raw materials  chemicals and energy 
finally  the lower level of net sales resulted in cash generated from reduced accounts receivable million in compared to an increase in acc ounts receivable of million in due to increased net sales in that year 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment were at relatively consistent levels during the last three years 
we expect efficiency improvement and energy saving projects  maintenance capital and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately million for  of which million will be for the foley energy project 
during  we spent million on this project  which is on schedule to be complete with full startup in the first quarter of a large portion of the spending for this project was financed by the million state of florida grant received in september through  we have spent million of this three year  million project  which involves the installation of a steam turbine generator and upgrade of two recovery boiler s  and is expected to save the equivalent of  barrels of oil per year and improve the energy self sufficiency of our foley plant from about to about 
we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with environmental obligations at our foley plant specialty fibers facility 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors  including when the final npdes permit is issued and its final terms and conditions

recent accounting pronouncements see note  recent accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectability of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
we increased decreased tax expense by million in  by million in and by million in by changes to our valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
on july  we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we record our unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included as a component of income before income taxes 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method which is based on the expected productive hours of the assets  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets is determined to not be recoverable  we measure the potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
no circumstances existed in and to indicate the carrying value of any of our assets may not be recoverable 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have previously adopted asc intangibles goodwill and other  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
in accordance with asc  we perform a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis  in the fourth fiscal quarter  and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill of businesses acquired is specifically identified to the reporting units to which the businesses belong 
we estimate fair value based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
the market approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units on comparable market prices 
goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
during our quarter ended december   based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million which represented our best estimate of the resulting goodwill impairment 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist with this impairment testing by expressing opinions as of december  of the fair values of the business enterprises of our four reporting units 
the results of step one indicated goodwill was impaired at three of our reporting units as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting units 
as such  step two of the goodwill impairment test was performed to determine the actual amount of goodwill impairment 
in this step  we were required to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step one  to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if these reporting units had been acquired on the date of the test 
we reviewed our long lived tangible and intangible assets within the impaired reporting units and we determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess of their carrying values and therefore these assets were not impaired 
see note  accounting policies and note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long lived assets and impairment charges 
non gaap financial measures in our press releases and other communication with investors  we include certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the non gaap measures used are adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share and are equal to operating income  net income and earnings per share excluding income from alternative fuel mixture credits  investment tax credits on prior period expenditures  restructuring  goodwill impairment and early debt retirement costs 
we believe that the presentation of these non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it allows for a more meaningful comparison of these financial measures to prior periods  but this information sh ould not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap 
we manage our business units by financial measures which exclude these items 
operating income and earnings per share targets for our all employee bonus and at risk compensation also exclude the benefit of alternative fuel mixture credits and the goodwill impairment charge 
year ended june  adjusted operating income operating income loss in accordance with gaap goodwill impairment restructuring costs alternative fuel mixture credits adjusted operating income adjusted net income net income loss in accordance with gaap goodwill impairment restructuring costs alternative fuel mixture credits early extinguishment of debt investment tax credit on prior period expenditures adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share eps eps in accordance with gaap goodwill impairment restructuring costs alternative fuel mixture credits early extinguishment of debt investment tax credit on prior period expenditures adjusted diluted eps we calculate ebitda as earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting plus interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda by adding back the following items asset impairment charges  non cash charges and other gains losses 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda to be an alternative measure of our net income  as an indicator of operating performance  or our cash flow  as an indicator of liquidity 
adjusted ebitda corresponds with the definition contained in our us revolving credit facility  established on july   and it provides useful information concerning our ability to comply with debt covenants 
although we believe adjusted ebitda enhances your understanding of our financial condition  this measure  when viewed individually  is not a better indicator of any trend as compared to other measures eg  net sales  net earnings  net cash flows  eg year ended june  adjusted ebitda net income loss income tax expense interest expense amortization of debt costs early extinguishment of debt depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda asset impairments non cash charges adjusted ebitda free cash flow is provided supplementally because it is widely used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in our industry 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities 
this measure is not a substitute for  and should not be used in conjunction with  gaap liquidity or financial measures 
we use free cash flow as one of our measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations 
other companies may calculate free cash flow differently

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to a million increase in the fair value of long term debt as of june  we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding on june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to libor rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
we and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we do not have any hedges in place to protect against fluctuations in any of these currencies  but we do sometimes hedge this exposure 
our euro exposure is internally hedged for the most part because a high percentage of both the sales and costs at our steinfurt  germany plant are denominated in euros 
we estimate that the negative pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the euro usd euro rate on our operating income is about million annually 
we estimate the positive pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the canadian dollar usd cad exchange rate at about million annually 
we estimate the negative pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the brazilian real usd brl exchange rate at about million annually 
we are continuously evaluating our foreign currency exposure and our hedging policy is subject to change 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolid ated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
as of june  and june  we had contracts in place to purchase  mmbtus through december and  mmbtus through may  respectively  of natural gas at various fixed prices through december additionally  as of june  we had options in place to purchase  mmbtus of natural gas at prices ranging from to per mmbtu through november
