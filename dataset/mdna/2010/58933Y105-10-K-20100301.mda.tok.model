joint ventures merck schering plough partnership in  old merck and schering plough collectively  the legacy companies entered into an agreement to create an equally owned partnership to develop and market in the united states new prescription medicines for cholesterol management 
in december  the cholesterol management partnership was expanded to include all the countries of the world  excluding japan 
in october  zetia  the first in a new class of cholesterol lowering agents  was launched in the united states 
in july  vytorin  a combination product containing the active ingredients of both zetia and zocor  was approved in the united states 
as previously disclosed  in january  the legacy companies announced the results of the effect of combination ezetimibe and high dose simvastatin vs 
simvastatin alone on the atherosclerotic process in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia enhance clinical trial  an imaging trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  a rare genetic condition that causes very high levels of ldl bad cholesterol and greatly increases the risk for premature coronary artery disease 
as previously reported  despite the fact that ezetimibe simvastatin mg vytorin significantly lowered ldl bad cholesterol more than simvastatin mg alone  there was no significant difference between treatment with ezetimibe simvastatin and simvastatin alone on the pre specified primary endpoint  a change in the thickness of carotid artery walls over two years as measured by ultrasound 
the improved reduction in high risk subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome improve it trial is underway and is designed to provide cardiovascular outcomes data for ezetimibe simvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndrome 
no incremental benefit of ezetimibe simvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established 
in january  the fda announced that it had completed its review of the final clinical study report of enhance 
the fda stated that the results from enhance did not change its position that elevated ldl cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that lowering ldl cholesterol reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease 
for a discussion concerning litigation arising out of the enhance study  see item a 
risk factors and item legal proceedings below 
on july   efficacy and safety results from the simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis seas study were announced 
seas was designed to evaluate whether intensive lipid lowering with vytorin mg would reduce the need for aortic valve replacement and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality versus placebo in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic stenosis who had no indication for statin therapy 
vytorin failed to meet its primary endpoint for the reduction of major cardiovascular events 
in the study  patients in the group who took vytorin mg had a higher incidence of cancer than the group who took placebo 
there was also a nonsignificant increase in deaths from cancer in patients in the group who took vytorin versus those who took placebo 
cancer and cancer deaths were distributed across all major organ systems 
the company believes the cancer finding in seas is likely to be an anomaly that  taken in light of all the available data  does not support an association with vytorin 
in august  the fda announced that it was investigating the results from the seas trial 
in december  the fda announced that it had completed its review of the data from the seas trial as well as a review of interim data from the study of heart and renal protection sharp and improve it trials 
based on currently available information  the fda indicated it believed it is unlikely that vytorin or zetia increase the risk of cancer related death 
the sharp trial is expected to be completed in the improve it trial is scheduled for completion in in the improve it trial  a blinded interim efficacy analysis will be conducted by the data safety monitoring board for the trial when approximately of the endpoints have been accrued 
that interim analysis is expected to be conducted in the company is committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data  however  the company does not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted

this amount was based primarily on a multiple of old merck s average annual variable returns derived from sales of the former astra usa  inc products for the three years prior to the redemption the limited partner share of agreed value 
old merck recorded a billion pretax gain on the partial redemption in the partial redemption of old merck s interest in the product rights did not result in a change in old merck s limited partnership interest 
as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below  after certain adjustments  old merck recorded an aggregate pretax gain of billion in in conjunction with the restructuring  astra purchased an option the asset option for a payment of million  which was recorded as deferred income  to buy old merck s interest in the kbi products  excluding the gastrointestinal medicines nexium esomeprazole and prilosec the non ppi products 
astrazeneca can exercise the asset option in the first half of at an exercise price of million which represents the net present value as of march  of projected future pretax revenue to be received by the company from the non ppi products the appraised value 
on february   astrazeneca notified the company that it was exercising the asset option 
old merck also had the right to require astra to purchase such interest in at the appraised value

table of contents competition the markets in which the company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the company s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors  industry consolidation  patents granted to competitors  competitive combination products  new products of competitors  new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as the company s products mature 
in addition  patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors  and the outcome can be highly uncertain 
an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to certain products 
competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown 
the effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted 
pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively 
with its long standing emphasis on research and development  the company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations 
additional resources to meet market challenges include quality control  flexibility to meet customer specifications  an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service 
the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances  such as joint ventures  and licenses and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions 
however  the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements  even for products protected by patents 
for example  the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth for the company s products in that therapeutic category 
global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access 
in addressing cost containment pressure  the company makes a continuing effort to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care 
in addition  pricing flexibility across the company s product portfolio has encouraged growing use of its medicines and mitigated the effects of increasing cost pressures on individual medicines 
outside the united states  in difficult government budgetary environments  the company has worked with payers to encourage allocation of scarce resources to optimize healthcare outcomes  limiting the potentially detrimental effects of government policies on sales growth and access to innovative medicines and vaccines  and to support the discovery and development of innovative products to benefit patients 
the company also is working with governments in many emerging markets in eastern europe  latin america and asia to encourage them to increase their investments in health and thereby improve their citizens access to medicines 
in addition  certain countries within the eu  recognizing the economic importance of the research based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society  are working with industry representatives to improve the competitive climate through a variety of means including market deregulation 
the company anticipates that the worldwide trend toward cost containment will continue  resulting in ongoing pressures on healthcare budgets 
in the united states  major healthcare reform has been introduced and passed in both houses of congress 
a final revised bill which unifies both versions may be considered and adopted into law 
the impact of such actions  as well as budget pressures on governments in the united states and other nations  cannot be predicted at this time 
as the company continues to successfully launch new products  contribute to health care debates and monitor reforms  its new products  policies and strategies should enable it to maintain a strong position in the changing economic environment 
although no one can predict the outcome of these and other legislative  regulatory and advocacy initiatives  the company believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces 
access to medicines the company is also committed to improving access to medicines and enhancing the quality of life for people around the world 
to cite just one example  the african comprehensive hiv aids partnerships in 
table of contents botswana  a partnership between the government of botswana  the bill melinda gates foundation and the merck company foundation merck co  inc  is supporting botswana s response to hiv aids through a comprehensive and sustainable approach to hiv prevention  care  treatment  and support 
to further catalyze access to hiv medicines in developing countries  the company makes no profit on the sale of its current hiv aids medicines in the world s poorest countries and those hardest hit by the pandemic  and offers its hiv aids medicines at significantly reduced prices to medium income countries 
in february  old merck announced that it had again reduced the price of stocrin in the least developed countries of the world and those hardest hit by the pandemic 
through these and other actions  the company is working independently and with partners in both the public and private sectors to address the most critical barriers to access to medicines in the developing world 
addressing these barriers requires investments in education  training and health infrastructure and to improve capacity achieved through increased international assistance and sustainable financing 
in addition  old merck has committed to providing rotateq to the global alliance for vaccines and immunization eligible countries at prices at which it does not profit 
also  in  old merck and the wellcome trust established the msd wellcome trust hilleman laboratories  a joint venture in india to develop vaccines for millions of people in some of the poorest areas of the world 
government regulation the pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by regional  country  state and local agencies around the world 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states  which administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling  and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in many cases  the fda requirements have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states 
in  the food and drug administration modernization act the fda modernization act was passed and was the culmination of a comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the fda and to improve the regulation of drugs  medical devices  and food 
the legislation was principally designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting the premarket review process for new products 
a key provision of the legislation is the re authorization of the prescription drug user fee act of  which permits the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment fda resources earmarked for the review of human drug applications 
this helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs 
in the united states  the government expanded access for senior citizens to prescription drug coverage by enacting the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which was signed into law in december prescription drug coverage began on january  this legislation supports the company s goal of improving access to medicines by expanding insurance coverage  while preserving market based incentives for pharmaceutical innovation 
at the same time  the legislation has helped control the cost of prescription drug costs through competitive pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines 
as mentioned above  in the united states major healthcare reform has been introduced and passed in both houses of congress 
a final revised bill which unifies both versions may be considered and adopted into law 
the us congress has also considered  and may consider again  proposals to increase the government s role in pharmaceutical pricing in the medicare program 
these proposals may include removing the current legal prohibition against the secretary of the health and human services intervening in price negotiations between medicare drug benefit program plans and pharmaceutical companies 
they may also include mandating the payment of rebates for some or all of the pharmaceutical utilization in medicare drug benefit plans 
in addition  congress may again consider proposals to allow  under certain conditions  the importation of medicines from other countries 
for many years  the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with the approval process for new drugs  drug safety  advertising and promotion  drug purchasing and reimbursement programs  and formularies 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations  including the introduction of new drugs to the market  in this regulatory environment 
the company continues to work with private and public payors to slow increases in healthcare spending 
also  us federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for 
table of contents which they pay 
for example  federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid  to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and disproportionate share hospitals hospitals meeting certain criteria  and to provide minimum discounts of off of a defined non federal average manufacturer price for purchases by certain components of the federal government such as the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense 
initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by medicaid legislation  in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for medicaid 
under the federal vaccines for children entitlement program  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc funds and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of medicaid eligible  uninsured  native american and certain underinsured children 
old merck was awarded a cdc contract in for the supply of pediatric vaccines for the vaccines for children program 
outside the united states  the company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in most of the countries where it does business 
there  too  the primary thrust of governmental inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness  often with mechanisms for controlling the prices of or reimbursement for prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies 
the eu has adopted directives concerning the classification  labeling  advertising  wholesale distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use 
the company s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives  consequently  it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company s business 
in january  the ec launched a sector inquiry in the pharmaceutical industry under the rules of eu competition law 
as part of this inquiry  old merck s offices in germany were inspected by the authorities beginning in january the preliminary report of the ec was issued on november   and following the public consultation period  the final report was issued in july the final report confirmed that there has been a decline in the number of novel medicines reaching the market and instances of delayed market entry of generic medicines and discussed industry practices that may have contributed to these phenomena 
while the ec has issued further inquiries with respect to the subject of the investigation  the ec has not alleged that the company or any of its subsidiaries have engaged in any unlawful practices 
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is  therefore  subject to potential administrative actions 
such actions may include seizures of products and other civil and criminal sanctions 
under certain circumstances  the company on its own may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 
the company believes that it should be able to compete effectively within this environment 
privacy and data protection the company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally 
the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve  and there has been an increasing attention to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the company s business  including recently enacted laws and regulations in the united states and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information 
distribution the company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers  hospitals  government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions 
human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians  wholesalers  physician distributors and government entities 
the company s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice  group practices and managed care organizations 
the company s professional representatives communicate the safety and value of the company s animal health products to veterinarians  distributors and animal producers 
the company s otc  foot care and sun care products are sold through wholesale and retail drug  food chain and mass merchandiser outlets 

table of contents raw materials raw materials and supplies  which are generally available from multiple sources  are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the company s business 
patents  trademarks and licenses patent protection is considered  in the aggregate  to be of material importance in the company s marketing of human health products in the united states and in most major foreign markets 
patents may cover products per se  pharmaceutical formulations  processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage 
the fda modernization act includes a pediatric exclusivity provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant 
these exclusivity provisions were re authorized by the prescription drug user fee act passed in september current us patent law provides additional patent term under patent term restoration for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review before the fda 

table of contents patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the company normally provide market exclusivity

that decision is being appealed 
see item legal proceedings patent litigation below 
by virtue of litigation settlement  generics have been given the right to enter the market as of while the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product  commercial benefits may continue to be derived from i later granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product  ii patents relating to the use of such product  iii patents relating to novel compositions and formulations  and iv in the united states and certain other countries  market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law 
the effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it  the growth of the market  the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act or similar laws and regulations in other countries 

table of contents the patents that provide us market exclusivity for cozaar and hyzaar expire in april in addition  the patent for cozaar will expire in a number of major european markets in march hyzaar lost patent protection in major european markets in february the company expects that sales of these products will decline rapidly after expiration of these patents  particularly in the united states since there are expected to be multiple sources of generic products at the time of patent expiry 
in addition  the patent that provides us market exclusivity for singulair expires in august the company expects that within the two years following patent expiration  it will lose substantially all us sales of singulair  with most of those declines coming in the first full year following patent expiration 
also  the patent for singulair will expire in a number of major european markets in august and the company expects sales of singulair in those markets will decline significantly thereafter 
additions to market exclusivity are sought in the united states and other countries through all relevant laws  including laws increasing patent life 
some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by a general increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products 
additionally  improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the united states and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties

trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
royalties received during on patent and know how licenses and other rights amounted to million 
merck also paid royalties amounting to billion in under patent and know how licenses it holds 
research and development the company s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program 
approximately  people are employed in the company s research activities 
research and development expenses which included restructuring costs were billion in  billion in and billion in the company maintains its ongoing commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical development in support of new products 
the company maintains a number of long term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development 
the company s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company s research and development resources on disease areas of unmet medical needs  scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity 
merck is managing its research and development portfolio across diverse approaches to discovery and development by balancing investments appropriately on novel  innovative targets with the potential to have a major impact on human health  on developing best in class approaches  and on delivering maximum value of its new medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations 
another important component of the company s science based diversification is based on expanding the company s portfolio of modalities to include not only small molecules and vaccines  but also biologics  peptides and rnai 
further  merck moved to diversify its portfolio by creating a new division  merck bioventures  which has the potential to harness the market opportunity presented by biological medicine patent expiries by delivering high quality follow on biologic products to enhance access for patients worldwide 
the company will continue to pursue appropriate external licensing opportunities 
the integration plans for research and development are focused on integrating the research operations of the legacy companies  including providing an effective transition for employees  realizing projected merger synergies in the form of cost savings and revenue growth opportunities  and maintaining momentum in the company s late stage pipeline 
during  merck continued implementing a new model for its basic research global operating strategy at legacy merck research laboratories sites 
the new model will align franchise and function as well as align resources with disease area priorities and balance capacity across discovery phases and allow the company to act upon those programs with the highest probability of success 
additionally  across all 
table of contents disease area priorities  the company s strategy is designed to expand access to worldwide external science and incorporate external research as a key component of the company s early discovery pipeline in order to translate basic research productivity into late stage clinical success 
the company s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas  including anemia  atherosclerosis  cancer  diabetes  heart disease  hypertension  infectious diseases  inflammatory autoimmune diseases  migraine  neurodegenerative diseases  ophthalmics  osteoporosis  psychiatric diseases  respiratory disease and women s health 
the company supplements its internal research with an aggressive licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late stage compounds  as well as new technologies 
in the development of human health products  industry practice and government regulations in the united states and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation 
before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the united states  recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the new drug application nda for a drug or the biologics license application bla for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the fda for the required approval 
once the company s scientists discover a new small molecule compound that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition  the company commences preclinical testing with that compound 
preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry  pharmacology and toxicology 
pending acceptable preclinical data  the company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements 
the clinical testing begins with phase i studies  which are designed to assess safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans 
if favorable  additional  larger phase ii studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population  define appropriate dosing for the compound  as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound s usefulness 
if data from the phase ii trials are satisfactory  the company commences large scale phase iii trials to confirm the compound s efficacy and safety 
upon completion of those trials  if satisfactory  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing 
there can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed 
vaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs 
preclinical testing focuses on the vaccine s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response immunogenicity 
pre marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases 
initial phase i clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to evaluate the safety  tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate 
phase ii studies are dose ranging studies 
finally  phase iii trials provide the necessary data on effectiveness and safety 
if successful  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies 
also during this stage  the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre approval inspection during which production of the vaccine as it is in progress is examined in detail 
in the united states  the fda review process begins once a complete nda is submitted and received by the fda 
pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act  the fda review period targets for ndas or supplemental ndas is either six months  for priority review  or ten months  for a standard review 
within days after receipt of an nda  the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review
