introduction the pep boys manny  moe jack is the only national chain offering automotive service  tires  parts and accessories 
this positioning allows us to streamline the distribution channel and pass the savings to the customer facilitating our vision of becoming the automotive solutions provider of choice for the value oriented customer 
the majority of our stores are in a supercenter format  which serves both do it for me difm  which includes service labor  installed merchandise and tires and do it yourself diy  or retail customers with the highest quality service offerings and merchandise 
most of our supercenters also have a commercial sales program that provides delivery of tires  parts and other products to automotive repair shops and dealers 
in  as part of our long term strategy to lead with automotive service  we began complementing our existing supercenter store base with service tire centers 
these service tire centers are designed to capture market share and leverage our existing supercenter and support infrastructure 
during fiscal  we opened new service tire centers  including ten locations acquired through our purchase of the assets of florida tire  inc  and opened one new prototype supercenter 
we are targeting a total of new service tire centers in fiscal and in fiscal as of january   we operated supercenters and service tire centers  as well as nine legacy pep express retail only stores throughout states and puerto rico 
executive summary during fiscal  the company continued to focus on executing its long term strategic plan and reported its first profitable year since fiscal for fiscal  earnings from continuing operations before taxes increased by  to  compared to a loss from continuing operations before taxes of  in the prior year 
net earnings for fiscal increased by  to  compared to a net loss of  in the prior year 
our increase in profitability resulted primarily from increased service revenues  increased gross profit margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses due to continued disciplined spending control 
our diluted earnings per share for fiscal was  a improvement over the loss per diluted share recorded in fiscal see results of operations 
for fiscal  our comparable sales sales generated by locations in operation during the same period of the prior year decreased by compared to a decrease of in the prior year 
the decrease in comparable sales was comprised of a increase in comparable service revenue and a decrease in comparable merchandise sales 
the difficult macroeconomic environment  including 
table of contents continued high unemployment and tight credit  negatively impacted sales of our discretionary product categories such as accessories and complementary merchandise 
sales of non discretionary product categories such as service and hard parts have benefited somewhat from this environment  as customers have focused on maintaining their existing vehicles rather than purchasing new vehicles 
in addition  our non discretionary product categories are primarily impacted by miles driven  which stabilized in the second half of after having declined for the previous year 
we believe that the stabilization in miles driven is primarily due to lower gasoline prices 
the company remains focused on refining and expanding the parts assortment to improve our in stock position  improving execution and the customer experience and utilizing television and radio advertising to communicate our value offerings 
in fiscal  we were able to successfully increase customer traffic and sales in our service and commercial businesses 
results of operations the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the years ended january   january  and february  analysis of statement of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues except as otherwise provided and the percentage change in dollar amounts of such items compared to the indicated prior period

table of contents costs of merchandise sales include the cost of products sold  buying  warehousing and store occupancy costs 
costs of service revenue include service center payroll and related employee benefits and service center occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include utilities  rents  real estate and property taxes  repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 
as a percentage of related sales or revenue  as applicable 
as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenue and comparable sales for fiscal decreased and  respectively as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in comparable store revenues consisted of a increase in comparable service revenue offset by a decrease in comparable merchandise sales 
while our total revenue figures were favorably impacted by our opening of new stores in fiscal  a new store is not added to our comparable store sales base until it reaches its th month of operation 
stores are removed from the comparable store sales base upon their relocation or closure 
once a relocated store reaches its th month of operation at its new location  it is added back into our comparable store sales base 
square footage increases are immaterial and accordingly  are not considered in our calculations of comparable store sales data 
total merchandise sales decreased to  compared to  in fiscal total service revenue increased to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease in merchandise sales was primarily due to weaker sales in our retail business stemming from less discretionary spending by our customers and lower diy customer counts 
excluding sales of discretionary products such as generators  electronics and transportation products  our diy core automotive sales remained relatively flat year over year 
service revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased customer counts 
during fiscal  customer traffic generated by improved store execution  promotional events and an improved hard parts inventory position resulted in an increase in service and commercial customer count 
however  total customer count declined as a result of a decrease in diy customer count 
we believe the decrease in retail customer count is due to reduced spending as a result of the current economic environment and our competitors continuing to open new stores as well as the result of the long term industry decline in the diy business 
in addition  we carry a large assortment of more discretionary retail product that is more susceptible to consumer spending deferrals 
we continue to believe that providing a differentiated merchandise assortment  better customer experience  low price value proposition and innovative marketing will stem the overall decline in customer counts and sales over the long term 
in fact  customer count in our diy space declined at a much lower rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year and we experienced our first increase in total customer count and sales in our third fiscal quarter since the first quarter of fiscal  and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased by  to  for fiscal from  in the prior year 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross profit from merchandise sales in fiscal includes the reversal of inventory accruals of approximately  established in the prior year related to our temporarily restricting the sale of certain small engine merchandise that was subject to an ongoing epa inquiry and a gain from insurance settlements of  mostly offset by an asset impairment charge of  as a result of continued declines in real estate values of previously closed locations 
in the prior year  gross profit from merchandise sales included an asset impairment charge of  and a  inventory accrual due to the epa inquiry referred to above 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit from merchandise sales increased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased despite a decrease in merchandise 
table of contents sales as discussed above  primarily as a result of an improvement in inventory shrinkage  lower in bound freight costs  lower warehousing costs which declined by basis points to of merchandise sales and lower store occupancy costs which declined by basis points to of merchandise sales 
warehousing costs declined primarily due to lower out bound freight costs to stores and occupancy costs declined due to lower building maintenance costs and the elimination of equipment leasing costs 
gross profit from service revenue increased to for fiscal from in fiscal gross profit from service revenue increased by  or 
both the current year and the prior year gross profit from service revenue included an asset impairment charge related to previously closed stores of  and  respectively 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit from service revenues increased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased service revenue which resulted in higher absorption of fixed expenses such as occupancy costs and  to a certain extent  labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or 
the decrease was primarily due to lower media expense of  lower legal expenses and professional services fees of  reduced payroll and related expenses of  lower travel expenses of  and improved general liability claims expense of  net gains from the disposition of assets for fiscal and fiscal reflect gains of  and  respectively  primarily as a result of sale leaseback transactions 
the company completed sale leaseback transactions on four stores during fiscal  as compared to sale leaseback transactions on approximately stores in fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal  a decline of  compared to the prior year 
fiscal and included gains from the retirement of debt of  and  respectively 
fiscal also included a  charge for deferred financing costs related to our revolving credit facility that was replaced 
excluding these items  interest expense declined by  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to reduced debt levels 
income tax expense was  or an effective rate of for the fiscal as compared to an income tax benefit of  or an effective rate of for the fiscal the current year effective tax rate includes a benefit of  due to the allocation of additional costs to certain jurisdictions thereby reducing past and future tax liabilities 
the prior year effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes  the recognition of gain for tax on surrender of life insurance policies and the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and credits 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal fiscal and included  on a pre tax basis  impairment charges of  and  respectively 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of  for fiscal  an increase of  from our net loss of  in fiscal our basic and diluted earnings per share were as compared to our basic and diluted loss per share of in the prior year 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenues for fiscal decreased to  compared to  for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to weaker sales in our retail business stemming from lower customer counts and the de emphasis of non core automotive merchandise 
comparable revenues decreased by  consisting of an decrease in comparable merchandise sales and a decrease in comparable service revenue 

table of contents in late fiscal and the first half of fiscal  as part of our long term strategic plan  we rebalanced our inventory through an aggressive mark down and sell through program of non core and unproductive merchandise in order to allow us to allocate a larger portion of our inventory investment to core automotive merchandise 
this action was taken because our core automotive merchandise  which is utilized in each of our lines of business diy and difm carries a higher gross product margin  requires less promotional activity and communicates to our customers our commitment to fulfilling all of their automotive aftermarket needs 
merchandise sales declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of our decision to exit non core and unproductive products and lower customer counts 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased  as a percentage of merchandise sales  to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in dollars was  or a decrease from fiscal the prior year included an inventory impairment charge of  and a  asset impairment charge resulting from the closure of stores 
included in fiscal is an asset and inventory impairment charge of  the asset impairment charge was primarily for certain closed locations as a result of the decline in real estate values and the inventory impairment charge was due to our temporarily restricting certain small engine merchandise for sale that is the subject of an ongoing epa inquiry 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit as a percent of merchandise sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in dollars  merchandise gross profit decreased  or primarily due to reduced merchandise sales 
a further breakdown of our gross profit from merchandise sales excluding the items mentioned above is as follows our product gross margins improved by basis points to and warehousing costs declined by basis points to of merchandise sales 
these improvements were partially offset by increased occupancy costs of basis points as a result of increased rental obligations stemming from the sale leaseback transactions 
gross profit from service revenue declined as a percentage of service revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit dollars from service revenue declined by in fiscal or  from fiscal the fiscal included a  asset impairment charge related to the closure of closed stores while fiscal included an additional asset impairment charge of  excluding these adjustments  gross profit from service revenue declined by  as a percentage of service revenues  gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to a  decline in service revenue as discussed above and higher workers compensation expense  partly offset by lower service payroll and related expenses 
the decline in sales volume resulted in reduced leverage of fixed expenses such as occupancy costs and to a certain extent labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal  however total selling general and administrative expenses declined by  or over the prior year 
this decrease in dollars was the result of expense control initiatives  with major reductions in compensation and compensation related benefits of  and lower media expense of  as compared to the same period in fiscal net gain from disposition of assets for fiscal and fiscal reflect gains of  and  respectively 
the  decrease resulted from the decline in the immediate recognition of gain on the sale leaseback transactions that were completed in the prior year as compared to those completed in the current year 
interest expense decreased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to reduced debt levels as a result of applying proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions 
included in fiscal are a gain of  due to debt repurchases and a  charge for deferred financing costs related to our previous credit facility 
fiscal includes a  charge for deferred financing costs resulting from the repayment of  
table of contents of our senior secured term loan facility and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss for the portion of the related interest rate swap that is no longer designated as a hedge 
excluding these adjustments  interest expense declined by  or 
non operating income as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease of  was due to lower investment balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal loss from discontinued operations was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal fiscal included impairment charges of  due to declines in real estate values 
fiscal included impairment charges of  due to store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal our income tax benefit as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  or  for fiscal versus  or  for fiscal the decline in the effective rate was due to the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes  the recognition of a gain for tax on the surrender of life insurance policies and the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and credits 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss decreased by  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the company s basic and diluted loss per share improved per share in fiscal to a loss of per share versus a loss of per share in fiscal discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted our long term strategic plan 
one of the initial steps in this plan was the identification of low return stores for closure 
we have accounted for these store closures and recognize impairments in accordance with the provisions established for exit or disposal activities 
accordingly  our discontinued operations for all periods presented reflect the operating results for of the closed stores because we do not believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores due to geographical considerations 
the operating results for the other closed stores are included in continuing operations because we believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores that are in close proximity 
the analysis of our results of continuing operations excludes the operating results of the above referenced stores which have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
industry comparison we operate in the us automotive aftermarket  which has two general lines of business the service business defined as do it for me service labor  installed merchandise and tires and the retail business defined as do it yourself retail merchandise and commercial 
generally  specialized automotive retailers focus on either the retail or service area of the business 
we believe that operation in both the retail and service areas positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation  which includes the reclassification of revenue from installed products from retail sales to service center revenue  shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas 
we compete in the retail area of the business through our retail sales floor and commercial sales 
table of contents business 
our service center business competes in the service area of the industry 
the following table presents the revenues and gross profit for each area of the business 
fiscal year ended dollar amounts in thousands january  january  february  retail sales service center revenue total revenues gross profit from retail sales gross profit from service center revenue total gross profit excludes revenues from installed products 
includes revenues from installed products 
gross profit from retail sales includes the cost of products sold  buying  warehousing and store occupancy costs 
gross profit from service center revenue includes the cost of installed products sold  buying  warehousing  service center payroll and related employee benefits and service center occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include utilities  rents  real estate and property taxes  repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 
effects of inflation we use the lifo method of inventory valuation 
thus  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current cost 
although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on revenues or results of operations during all fiscal years presented 

table of contents capital liquidity capital resources and needs our cash requirements arise principally from the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures related to existing and new stores  offices and distribution centers  debt service and contractual obligations 
cash flows realized through the sales of automotive services  tires  parts and accessories are our primary source of liquidity 
net cash provided by continuing operations was  for fiscal compared to a use of cash of  in fiscal the  improvement from the prior year was due to a  increase in our net earnings net of non cash adjustments and a  favorable change in operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to favorable changes in inventory of  accounts payable of  and in all other assets and liabilities of  the improved cash flows from inventory resulted from more disciplined inventory management  including reduced seasonal inventory purchases  inventory lead times and safety stocks 
the improvement in accounts payable after taking into consideration changes in the trade payable program liability shown as cash flows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows improved by  primarily due to the timing of our accounts payable cycle 
the favorable change in all other assets and liabilities was due to reduced accounts receivable as a result of improved collection of vendor allowances and trade receivables 
in addition  in the prior year  we expended approximately  to convert our vacation plan to a paid time off plan  satisfied approximately  of liabilities associated with the defined benefit portion of the executive supplemental retirement plan and paid  in connection with reducing the notional value on our interest rate swap 
cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal as compared to cash provided of  in fiscal during fiscal  we sold four properties that were classified as held for sale for net proceeds of  of which  is included in discontinued operations 
we also completed sale leaseback transactions on four stores for net proceeds of  during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets other than real property of florida tire  inc for  in connection with the acquisition  we recorded a contingent liability of  which could result in future payments through november fiscal included positive cash flows of  primarily due to sale leaseback transactions 
the proceeds were used primarily to repurchase properties for  that were previously leased under a master operating lease 
capital expenditures were  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures for the current year were for improvement of our existing stores and distribution centers  opening of new service tire centers and one prototype supercenter 
our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  which includes the addition of approximately service tire centers and required expenditures for our existing stores  offices and distribution centers 
these expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand  net cash generated from operating activities and opportunistic single store sale leaseback transactions 
additional capacity  if needed  exists under our line of credit 
in fiscal and fiscal  we used cash in financing activities of  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we repurchased  of our outstanding senior subordinated notes for  and repaid  of borrowings under our credit facility 
in fiscal  we used the proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions discussed above to reduce debt obligations under our then existing credit facility and to repurchase  principal amount of our senior secured notes for we anticipate that cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities  and cash provided by opportunistic single store sale leaseback transactions will exceed our expected cash requirements in fiscal in addition  we expect to have excess availability under our existing line of credit during the 
table of contents entirety of fiscal as of january   we had undrawn availability under our revolving credit agreement of  our working capital was  and  at january  and january   respectively 
our long term debt  as a percentage of our total capitalization  was and at january  and january   respectively 
as of january   we had an outstanding balance of  classified as trade payable program liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet under our vendor financing program 
the vendor financing program  which is funded by various bank participants who have the ability  but not the obligation  to purchase account receivables owed by us directly from our vendors 
contractual obligations the following chart represents our total contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years dollars in thousands long term debt operating leases expected scheduled interest payments on long term debt other long term obligations total contractual obligations long term debt includes current maturities 
primarily includes pension obligation of  income tax liabilities and asset retirement obligations 
we made voluntary contributions of   and  to our pension plans in fiscal  and  respectively 
future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
the above table does not reflect the timing of projected settlements for our recorded asset disposal costs of  income tax liabilities of  and pension obligation of  because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments 
commercial commitments total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years dollar amounts in thousands import letters of credit standby letters of credit surety bonds purchase obligations total commercial commitments our open purchase orders are based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short periods of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements and generally  our open purchase orders orders that have not been shipped are not binding agreements 
those purchase obligations that are in transit from our vendors at january  are considered commercial commitments 

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a commercial commitment to purchase approximately  of products over a six year period 
at january   we expect to meet the cumulative minimum purchase requirements under this contract and to completely satisfy and terminate this contract during fiscal long term debt senior subordinated notes  due december on december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december  during fiscal and  the company repurchased notes in the principal amount of  and  respectively 
on january   the outstanding balance of these notes was senior secured term loan facility  due october on january   we entered into a  senior secured term loan facility due january  this facility is secured by a collateral pool consisting of real property and improvements associated with our stores  which is adjusted periodically based upon real estate values and borrowing levels 
interest at the rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus on this facility was payable starting in february proceeds from this facility were used to satisfy and discharge our then outstanding  medium term notes due march  and  term enhanced remarketable securities terms due july  and to reduce borrowings under our line of credit by approximately on october   we amended and restated the senior secured term loan facility to i increase the size from  to  ii extend the maturity from january  to october  and iii reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
proceeds were used to satisfy and discharge  in outstanding convertible senior notes due june  on february   we further amended the senior secured term loan facility to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
on november   we sold the land and buildings for owned properties to an independent third party 
we used  of the net proceeds to prepay a portion of the senior secured term loan facility 
this prepayment reduced the principal amount of the facility to  and reduced the scheduled quarterly repayments from  to  in addition  the prepayment resulted in the recognition in interest expense of approximately  of deferred financing fees and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss for the portion of the related interest rate swap that is no longer designated as a hedge 
as of january   stores collateralized the senior secured term loan 
the outstanding balance under the term loan at the end of fiscal was  the  decline in the outstanding balance was due to quarterly principal payments 
revolving credit agreement  through january on january   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with available borrowings up to  our ability to borrow under the revolving credit agreement is based on a specific borrowing base consisting of inventory and accounts receivable 
total incurred fees of  were capitalized and are amortized over the year life of the facility 
the interest rate on this credit line is libor or prime plus to based upon the then current availability under the agreement 
fees based on the unused portion of the agreement range from to basis points 
as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement 

table of contents the weighted average interest rate on all debt borrowings during fiscal and were and  respectively 
other matters several of our debt agreements require compliance with covenants 
the most restrictive of these requirements is contained in our revolving credit agreement 
during any period when the availability under the revolving credit agreement drops below the greater of  or of the borrowing base  we are required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least  calculated as the ratio of a ebitda net income plus interest charges  provision for taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  non cash stock compensation expenses and other non recurring  non cash items minus capital expenditures and income taxes paid to b the sum of debt service charges and restricted payments made 
the failure to satisfy this covenant would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit agreement  which would result in a cross default under our senior subordinated notes and senior secured term loan 
as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  additional availability of approximately  and was in compliance with its financial covenants 
other contractual obligations on june   we entered into a vendor financing program with availability up to  under this program  our factor made accelerated and discounted payment to our vendors and we in turn  made our regularly scheduled full vendor payments to the factor 
the availability was subsequently reduced to  on april   we replaced this program with a new program which is funded by various bank participants who have the ability  but not the obligation  to purchase account receivables owed by us directly from our vendors 
there was an outstanding balance of  and  under these programs as of january  and january   respectively 
we have letter of credit arrangements in connection with our risk management  import merchandising and vendor financing programs 
we were contingently liable for  and  in outstanding import letters of credit and  and  in outstanding standby letters of credit as of january  and january   respectively 
we are also contingently liable for surety bonds in the amount of approximately  and  as of january  and january   respectively 
the surety bonds guarantee certain of our payments for example utilities  easement repairs  licensing requirements and customs fees 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases and lease financings which contain renewal and escalation clauses  step rent provisions  capital improvements funding and other lease concessions 
these provisions are considered in the calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
total operating lease commitments as of january  were  pension and retirement plans the company has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this unfunded plan had a defined benefit component that provided key employees designated by the board of directors with 
table of contents retirement and death benefits 
retirement benefits were based on salary and bonuses  death benefits were based on salary 
benefits paid to a participant under the defined pension plan are deducted from the benefits otherwise payable under the defined benefit portion of the serp 
on january   we amended and restated our serp 
this amendment converted the defined benefit portion of the serp to a defined contribution portion for certain unvested participants and all future participants 
on december   the company terminated the defined benefit portion of the serp with a  payment and recorded a charge of  the serp currently consists of only the defined contribution plan which we refer to as our account plan 
the company has two qualified k savings plans  which cover all full time employees who are at least years of age with one or more years of service 
the company contributes the lesser of of the first of a participant s contributions or of the participant s compensation 
for fiscal  and again for fiscal  the company s contributions were conditional upon the achievement of certain pre established financial performance goals 
the company s savings plans contribution expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan covering our full time employees hired on or before february  as of december   the company froze the accrued benefits under the plan and active participants became fully vested 
the plan s trustee will continue to maintain and invest plan assets and will administer benefits payments 
pension plan assets are stated at fair market value and are composed primarily of money market funds  and collective trust funds primarily invested in equity and fixed income investments 
the expense under these plans for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
the fiscal pension expense includes a serp settlement charge of  pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
in developing the expected return on asset assumptions  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations 
the discount rate utilized for the pension plans is based on a model bond portfolio with durations that match the expected payment patterns of the plans 
we continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions and make adjustments as necessary for the existing plans 
in fiscal  we contributed an aggregate of  to our pension plans to fund the retirement obligations and for the termination of the defined benefit portion of the serp 
based upon the current funded status of the account plan  we do not expect to make any cash contributions in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventory is stated at the lower of cost  as determined under lifo  or market in the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and current market conditions 
in addition  historically we have been able to return excess items to vendors for credit 
future changes in vendors  in their policies or in their willingness to accept returns of excess inventory  could require a revision in the estimates 
if our estimates regarding excess or obsolete inventory are inaccurate  we may incur losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in these estimates at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  other casualty coverages and health care insurance  including stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using generally accepted actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we record reserves for future product returns  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on expected returns of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have significant pension costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and merit and promotion increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the 
table of contents assumptions 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligation and expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant change in assumption dollars in thousands impact on annual pension expense impact on projected benefit obligation percentage point decrease in discount rate increase increase  percentage point increase in discount rate decrease decrease  percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets increase percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets decrease we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments  including judgments related to store cash flows  are based on market and operating conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management s conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans on a fair value basis 
we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for fiscal would have affected net earnings by approximately  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings 
at any one time our tax returns for many tax years are subject to examination by us federal  commonwealth  and state taxing jurisdictions 
for income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  
table of contents court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in this regard when determining whether or not we should establish a valuation allowance  the company considers various tax planning strategies  including potential real estate transactions  as future taxable income 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods from either operations or projected tax planning strategies 
we had net deferred tax assets of  and  as of january  and january   respectively
