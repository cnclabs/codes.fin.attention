item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the principal elements of our global business strategy 
we maintain our principal executive offices at valley road  wayne  new jersey our wholly owned subsidiaries are located in the united states  the united kingdom and australia with distribution centers situated at their various locations 
see business properties 
our telephone number is continuing operations products our infant and juvenile product line currently consists of approximately  products that principally focus on children of the age group newborn to three years 
kids line products  which are marketed primarily under the kids line  carter s and disney brands  and cocalo products  which are marketed primarily under the cocalo baby  cocalo couture  and cocalo naturals tm brands  each consist primarily of infant bedding and related nursery accessories and d cor such as blankets  rugs  mobiles  nightlights  hampers  lamps and wall art 
lajobi products  which are marketed primarily under the babi italia  europa baby  bonavita  graco and serta brands  consist primarily of cribs  mattresses and other nursery furniture 
sassy products  which are marketed primarily under the sassy brand  consist primarily of developmental toys and feeding  bath and baby care items with features that address the various stages of an infant s early years 
during and  we expanded our product line to offer products at a broader variety of price points and also added several environmentally friendly products 
for example  kids line significantly increased its sales of carter s brand bedding separates  while kids line and cocalo each introduced new organic  eco friendly brands 
cocalo also expanded and refined its cocalo couture brand  which targets higher price points 
lajobi also developed a new brand nursery which was introduced in  which represents products at a lower price point than the rest of its line 
we have also expanded the collaborative activities between our business units  and co develop and cross market certain products 
most of our infant and juvenile products have selling prices between and  with the exception of lajobi furniture products  which have selling prices of to product sales are highly diverse  and no single item represented more than of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in the company categorizes its sales in five product categories  functional soft goods  functional hard goods  accessories and d cor  toys and entertainment and other 
functional soft goods includes bedding  blankets  mattresses and sleep positioners  functional hard goods includes cribs and other nursery furniture  feeding products  baby gear and organizers  accessories and d cor includes hampers  lamps  rugs and d cor  toys and entertainment includes developmental toys  bath toys and mobiles  other includes all other products that do not fit in the above four categories 
the following table sets forth the company s consolidated net sales by product category  as a percentage of total consolidated net sales  for the years ended december   and year ended december  functional soft goods functional hard goods accessories and d cor toys and entertainment other total 
table of contents design and production we maintain a continuing program of new product development 
we design most of our own products  although certain products are designed by independent designers or are licensed from other third parties 
items are added to the product line only if we believe that they can be sourced and marketed on a basis that meets our profitability standards 
generally  a new design is brought to market in less than one year after a decision is made to produce the product 
sales of our products are  in large part  dependent on our ability to anticipate  identify and react quickly to changing consumer preferences and to effectively utilize our sales and distribution systems to bring new products to market 
we occasionally engage in market research and test marketing to evaluate consumer reactions to our products 
research into consumer buying trends often suggests new products 
we assemble information from retail stores  our sales force  focus groups  industry experts and our product development personnel 
we continually analyze our products to determine whether they should be adapted into new or different products using elements of the initial design or whether they should be removed from the product line 
substantially all of our products are produced by independent manufacturers  generally in eastern asia  under the quality review of our personnel 
our products are designed  manufactured  packaged and labeled to conform to all applicable safety requirements under us federal and other applicable laws and regulations  various industry developed voluntary standards and product specific standards 
during  we utilized numerous manufacturers in eastern asia for our continuing operations  with facilities primarily in the people s republic of china prc and other eastern asia countries 
during  approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our continuing operations was attributable to manufacturing in the prc 
members of our eastern asia and us product development staff make frequent visits to such manufacturers 
the prc currently enjoys permanent normal trade relations pntr status under us tariff laws  which provides a favorable category of us import duties 
the loss of such pntr status would result in a substantial increase in the import duty for products manufactured for us in the prc and imported into the united states and would result in an increase in our sourcing costs 
in  the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of the purchases for our continuing operations accounted for approximately of such purchases and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate 
we believe that there are alternate manufacturers for our products and sources of raw materials 
see item a  risk factors we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations 
pursuant to the terms of a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of lajobi  we currently utilize the full time services of approximately employees of a thailand company owned by the former owners of the lajobi business  including lawrence bivona  who currently serves as president of lajobi  and certain members of mr 
bivona s family 
these employees are engaged primarily in quality control activities with respect to the manufacture of lajobi products 
pursuant to the terms of our arrangements with lajobi  we reimburse the thailand company for the actual  direct costs incurred in connection with the employment of these individuals  and we intend to establish arrangements to directly employ a staff in thailand 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  certain relationships and related transactions and director independence  for more information regarding these arrangements 
in addition  we employ additional staff in the prc who monitor the production process with 
table of contents responsibility for the quality  safety and prompt delivery of our products  as well as product development and compliance issues 
marketing and sales our products are marketed through our own direct sales force of full time employees as of december  and through independent manufacturers representatives and distributors to retail customers in the united states and certain foreign countries including  but not limited to  mass merchandisers  baby superstores  specialty stores  department stores and boutiques 
during  we maintained a direct sales force and distribution network for our continuing operations in the united states  the united kingdom and australia 
we also maintain relationships with several independent manufacturers representatives and distributors to service certain retail customers in several other foreign countries 
our sales by foreign based operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our consolidated foreign sales from continuing operations  including export sales from the united states  aggregated million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to revenues from external customers  a measure of profit or loss and total assets for each of the years ending december  and  respectively  as well as specified geographic information 
during  we sold infant and juvenile products to approximately  customers worldwide 
toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc 
in the aggregate accounted for approximately  and target corporation target accounted for approximately  of our consolidated gross sales from continuing operations during the loss of any of these customers  or the loss of certain other large customers  could have a material adverse affect on us 
see item a  risk factors our business is dependent on several large customers and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we reinforce the marketing efforts of our sales force through an active promotional program  including showrooms at our principal facilities  participation in trade shows  trade and consumer advertising 
we also seek to further capture synergies between our businesses by cross marketing products and building upon the strong customer relationships developed by each of our subsidiaries  as well as by consolidating certain operational activities 
customer service is an essential component of our marketing strategy 
we maintain customer service departments that respond to customer inquiries  investigate and resolve issues and generally assist customers 
our general terms of sale are competitive with others in our industry 
sales are typically made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions 
distribution many of our customers  particularly mass merchandisers  pick up their goods at our regional distribution centers  which are located in south gate  california  cranbury  new jersey  kentwood  michigan  eastleigh  hampshire uk  and sydney  australia 
we also use common carriers to arrange shipments to customers who request such arrangements  including smaller retailers and specialty stores 
cocalo distributes its products through a third party logistics provider that is a related company 
lajobi also utilizes the services of an independent third party logistics provider in california for a portion of its distribution requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  certain relationships and related transactions and director independence  for more information regarding cocalo s third party logistics agreement 

table of contents seasonality we typically do not experience significant seasonal variations in demand for our products 
sales to our retail customers may be higher in periods when retailers take initial shipments of new products  as these orders typically incorporate enough products to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year  and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
competition the infant and juvenile products industry is highly competitive and is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and includes numerous domestic and foreign competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have financial and other resources greater than ours 
we compete with a number of different competitors  depending on the product category  and compete against no single company across all of our product categories 
our competition includes large  infant and juvenile product companies and specialty infant and juvenile product manufacturers 
we compete principally on the basis of proprietary product design  brand name recognition  product quality  innovation  relationships with major retailers  customer service and price value relationship 
in addition  certain of our potential customers  in particular mass merchandisers  have the financial and other resources necessary to buy products similar to those that we sell directly from manufacturers in eastern asia and elsewhere  thereby potentially reducing the size of our potential market 
see item a  risk factors competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
copyrights  trademarks  patents and licenses we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights  patents  licenses and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property 
we believe our intellectual property has significant value  though we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on intellectual property due to the availability of substitutes  creation of other designs  and the variety of other products 
intellectual property protections are limited or even unavailable in some foreign countries and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property can be difficult even in countries with substantial legal protection 
in addition  the portion of our business that relies on the use of intellectual property is subject to the risk of challenges by third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights 
we enter into license agreements relating to trademarks  copyrights  patents  designs and products which enable us to market items compatible with our product line 
we currently maintain license agreements with  among others  the william carter company carter s  disney enterprises  inc  graco childrens products  inc  and serta  inc our license agreements are typically for terms of two to five years with extensions possible if agreed to by both parties 
royalties are paid on licensed products and  in many cases  advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single license  although the carter s license accounted for a significant percentage of net revenue of kids line for the years ended  and  and the graco and serta licenses each accounted for a significant percentage of net revenues of lajobi for the years ended and in connection with the gift sale  a newly formed delaware limited liability company owned by kid the licensor executed a license agreement the license agreement with trc 
pursuant to the license agreement  the licensor has granted to trc an exclusive license subject to certain specified exceptions permitting the licensee to use specified intellectual property  consisting generally of the russ and applause trademarks and trade names the retained ip 
subject to provisions for early termination for specified events of default  the license agreement will expire on december  subject to a nine month extension under specified circumstances 
trc has the option to purchase all of the retained ip from the licensor for million at any time  subject to certain requirements  including the absence of any defaults and 
table of contents the prior repayment in full of the seller note as defined in the license agreement 
if trc does not purchase the retained ip by december  or  under certain circumstances  nine months thereafter  the licensor will have the option to require trc to purchase all of the retained ip for million 
during the term of the license agreement  trc is required to pay the licensor a fixed  annual royalty the royalty equal to  the initial annual royalty payment was due and was payable in one lump sum on december  thereafter  the royalty is due quarterly at the close of each three month period during the term 
licensor has not received either the initial  lump sum royalty payment or the first quarterly royalty payment due on march  kid and trc are currently in active negotiations with respect to  among other things  a potential restructuring of i the consideration received by kid for its former gift business  ii payments due to ip sub under the license agreement  and iii ongoing arrangements between the parties and their respective affiliates 
however  there can be no assurance that any such defaulted payments under the license agreement will be made in a timely manner  or at all  or that such negotiations will result in any definitive agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section captioned other events and circumstances pertaining to liquidity for a discussion of the royalty defaults under the license agreement with trc 
further detail with respect to the license agreement can be found in our current report on form k filed on december  employees as of december   we employed approximately persons 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
most of our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement  although approximately sassy employees  representing approximately of our total employees  were represented by a collective bargaining agreement as of december  government regulation certain of our products are subject to the provisions of  among other laws  the federal hazardous substances act  the federal consumer product safety act and the federal consumer product safety improvement act 
those laws empower the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to protect consumers from certain hazardous articles by regulating their use or excluding them from the market and requiring the recall of products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
the cpsc s determination is subject to judicial review 
similar laws exist in some states and cities in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold 
we maintain a quality control program in order to comply with such laws  and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all the foregoing laws 
notwithstanding the foregoing  no assurance can be made that all products are or will be free from hazards or defects

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below constitute the material risks pertaining to our business 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such cases  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our net sales and profitability depend on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market products that appeal to consumers 
the introduction of new products is critical in our industry and to our growth strategy 
a significant percentage of our product line is replaced each year with new products 
our business depends on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of our product offerings 
rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends make it difficult to predict how long consumer demand for our existing products will continue or which new products will be successful 
our current products may not continue to be popular or new products that we introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
a decline in consumer demand for our products  our failure to develop new products on a timely basis in anticipation of changing consumer preferences or the failure of our new products to achieve and sustain consumer acceptance could reduce our net sales and profitability 
in addition  changes in customer preferences leave us vulnerable to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
thus  our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales and brand loyalty 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to the excessive discounts and markdowns that might be necessary to reduce inventory levels 
our inability to effectively manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin could be adversely affected by several factors 
gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by increases in vendor costs including as a result of increases in the cost of raw materials or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
for example  increased costs in the prc  primarily for labor  raw materials and the impact of certain tax laws  as well as the appreciation of the chinese yuan against the us dollar  have at times negatively impacted our gross margins 
in addition  increased pressure from major retailers  primarily as a result of prevailing economic conditions  to offer additional mark downs and other credits or price concessions to clear existing inventory and secure new product placements  may also negatively impact our margins 
economic conditions  such as rising fuel prices and currency exchange fluctuations  may also adversely impact our margins 
in addition  our kids line and cocalo businesses use significant quantities of cotton  either in the form of cotton fabric or cotton polyester fabric 
cotton is subject to ongoing price fluctuations because it is an agricultural product impacted by changing weather patterns  disease and other factors  such as supply and demand considerations  both domestically and internationally 
in addition  increased oil prices affect key components of the raw material prices in many of our products 
significant increases in the prices of cotton or oil could adversely affect our gross margins and our operations 

table of contents the state of the economy may impact our business 
economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many of the countries and regions in which we do business and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
global economic conditions have been challenged by slowing growth and the sub prime debt devaluation crisis  causing worldwide liquidity and credit concerns 
continuing adverse global economic conditions in our markets would likely negatively impact our business  which could result in reduced demand for our products  increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  limitations in the capital resources available to us and others with whom we conduct business  increased risk in the collectability of accounts receivable from our customers  increased risk of potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues  and delays in signing or failing to sign customer contracts or signing customer agreements at reduced purchase levels 
in addition  our operations and performance depend significantly on levels of consumer spending  which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions  including without limitation the united states  and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
for example  some of the factors that could influence the levels of consumer spending include consumer confidence  increases in fuel and other energy costs  conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets  stock market conditions  labor and healthcare costs  access to credit and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior 
these potential effects of the current global financial crisis are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  our operating results for any particular period may be difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price 
if the national and world wide financial crisis intensifies  further potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if sufficient internal funds are not available from our operations  we may be required to further rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as have been experienced during and  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility 
our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to such facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives  or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs 
table of contents can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  and reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash 
competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
certain of our competitors have greater brand recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  we may face competition from new participants in our markets because the infant and juvenile product industry has limited barriers to entry 
many of our principal customers are large mass merchandisers 
the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers  together with changes in consumer shopping patterns  have contributed to the formation of dominant multi category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers 
current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers  demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times 
other trends are for retailers to import products directly from factory sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with our products 
the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which our principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use  resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for consumer meaningful brands  the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products  continuing improvements in customer service  and the maintenance of strong relationships with large  high volume purchasers 
we also face the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of our major retailer customers  such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation 
the resulting risks include possible loss of sales  reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 
we also experience price competition for our products  competition for shelf space at retailers and competition for licenses  all of which may increase in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully in the future  our net sales and profitability will likely decline 
to compete successfully  we must develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands 
our ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on our ability to develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands so that our retailer customers will need our products to meet consumer demand 
the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives  although any such investment may not deliver the anticipated results 
our debt covenants may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions  incur debt  make investments  sell assets  merge or complete other significant transactions 
our current credit agreement includes provisions that place limitations on a number of our activities  including our ability to incur additional debt  create liens on our assets or make guarantees  make certain investments or loans  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  dispose of or sell assets  or enter into acquisitions  mergers or similar transactions 
these covenants could restrict our ability to pursue opportunities to expand our business operations 
we are required to make prepayments of our debt upon the occurrence of certain transactions  including most asset sales or debt or equity issuances and extraordinary receipts 

table of contents inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants 
our ability to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our current credit agreement is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our business model and current operational plans 
see the state of the economy may impact our business above 
if an event of default in such covenants occurs and is continuing  among other things  the lenders may accelerate the loans  declare the commitments thereunder to be terminated  seize collateral or take other actions of secured creditors 
if the loans are accelerated or commitments terminated  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
such alternative measures may not be available or successful 
also  our bank covenants may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
even if we are able to restructure or refinance our indebtedness  the economic terms may not be favorable to us 
in addition  an event of default under our credit agreement could result in a cross default under certain license agreements that we maintain 
all of the foregoing could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
our cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash to meet scheduled payments with respect to our debt depends on our financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and the other factors discussed in this risk factors section 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
as discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor  such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt services obligations 
the breach of any covenants or restrictions in our credit agreement could result in a default thereunder  which would permit the lenders to take the actions discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 
in addition  an event of default under our credit agreement could result in a cross default under certain license agreements that we maintain 
as discussed above  this could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
if we lose key personnel we may not be able to achieve our objectives 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of various members of senior management  as well as senior executives of several of our subsidiaries 
if for any reason  these or other key members of management do not continue to be active in management  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain senior executives or other personnel necessary for the continued success of our business 
our business is dependent on several large customers 
the continued success of our infant and juvenile businesses depends on our ability to continue to sell our products to several large mass market retailers 
in particular  toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc considered together and target accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated gross sales from continuing operations during we typically do not have long term contracts with our customers and the loss of the foregoing customers or one or more of our other large customers could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  our success depends upon the continuing willingness of large retailers to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
our access to shelf space at retailers for our products may be reduced by store closings  consolidation among these retailers  competition from other products or stricter requirements for infant and juvenile products by retailers that we may not be able to meet 
an adverse change in our relationship with  or the financial viability of  one or more of our customers could reduce our net sales and profitability 

table of contents we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our major retail customers 
certain of our retail customers purchase large quantities of our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our largest customers 
our profitability may be harmed if one or more of our largest customers were unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due or demand credits or other concessions for products they are unable to sell or for other reasons 
federal and state statutes allow courts  under certain specific circumstances  to void purchase transactions in the event of the bankruptcy of the purchaser 
under current federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws  in the event of the bankruptcy of a purchaser of the company s assets  the sale transaction may be voided or cancelled  and damages imposed on the company  if  among other things  such purchaser  at the time the transaction was consummated  received less than reasonably equivalent value for the consideration paid  and either was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such transaction 
the measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws vary depending upon the particular law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer or conveyance has occurred 
with respect to the gift sale  we believe that  on the basis of historical financial information  operating history and other factors  trc did receive reasonably equivalent value for the consideration paid by trc  and that trc was neither insolvent prior or subsequent to the consummation of the transaction 
we cannot assure you  however  as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 
in addition  although we obtained a solvency opinion in connection with this transaction confirming our position  we cannot assure what weight  if any  would be accorded thereto by a court 
we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products 
approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our continuing operations are attributable to manufacturers in the prc 
the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of purchases for our continuing operations accounted for approximately and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate during while we believe that there are many other manufacturing sources available for our product lines  difficulties encountered by one or several of our larger suppliers such as a fire  accident  natural disaster or an outbreak of illness eg  hn  sars or avian or other flu at one or more of their facilities  could halt or disrupt production at the affected facilities  delay the completion of orders  cause the cancellation of orders  delay the introduction of new products or cause us to miss a selling season applicable to some of our products 
in addition  our international operations subject us to certain other risks  including economic and political instability  restrictive actions by foreign governments  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights  changes in import duties or import or export restrictions  delays in shipping of product and unloading of product through ports  as well as timely rail truck delivery to our warehouses and or a customer s warehouse  complications in complying with the laws and policies of the united states affecting the importation of goods  including duties  quotas and taxes  complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws  and the effects of terrorist activity  armed conflict and epidemics 

table of contents any of these risks could disrupt the supply of our products or increase our expenses 
the costs of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws may increase our expenses and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
in addition  the introduction of certain social programs in the prc or otherwise will likely increase the cost of doing business for certain of our manufacturers  which could increase our manufacturing costs 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses 
our net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  except for a small amount of net sales denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars and euros 
our purchases of finished goods from eastern asian manufacturers are denominated in us dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are denominated in chinese yuan or other eastern asian currencies 
as a result  any material increase in the value of the yuan or such other currencies relative to the us or australian dollars or the uk pound would increase the prices at which we purchase finished goods and therefore could adversely affect our profitability 
we are also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars or euros from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
product liability  product recalls and other claims relating to the use of our products could increase our costs 
we face product liability risks relating to the use of our products 
we also must comply with a variety of product safety and product testing regulations 
in particular  our products are subject to  among other statutes and regulations  the consumer product safety act  the federal hazardous substances act fhsa and the consumer product safety improvement act cpsia  which empower the consumer product safety commission the cpsc  to take action against hazards presented by consumer products  including adjudication and promulgation of regulations and uniform safety standards 
with expanded authority under the cpsia  the cpsc has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to substantially all of our products 
these new regulations have or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of children s products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada  australia and europe  as well as certain other countries 
while we take the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  or if we face product liability claims  we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage and we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements 
furthermore  concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
for instance  following the receipt of consumer complaints that certain drop side cribs manufactured by lajobi did not work properly when the locking device was damaged or broken  we recently notified the cpsc of our intention to undertake voluntary corrective action with respect to such cribs 
with the exception of one child who received a bruise  we are unaware of any injuries associated with these cribs 
the financial impact of the proposed corrective action  an estimate of which has been accrued in the three months ended december   is not expected to be material 
recalls or post manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future that may adversely impact children s products  including the categories of products that we produce and sell 
in addition  one or more of our customers might require changes or impose their own standards for our products  such as the non use of certain materials 
complying with existing or any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business 
similarly  increased penalties for non compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such 
table of contents regulations 
furthermore  substantially all of our licenses give the licensor the right to terminate the license agreement if any products marketed under the license are subject to a product liability claim  recall or similar violations of product safety regulations or if we breach covenants relating to the safety of the products or their compliance with product safety regulations 
a termination of a license could adversely affect our net sales 
even if a product liability claim is without merit  the claim could harm our reputation and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
competition for licenses could increase our licensing costs or limit our ability to market products 
we market a portion of our products through licenses with other parties 
these licenses are generally limited in scope and duration and generally authorize the sale of specific licensed products on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis 
our license agreements often require us to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments that may exceed the amount we are able to generate from actual sales of the licensed products 
any termination of or failure to renew our significant licenses  or inability to develop and enter into new licenses  could limit our ability to market our licensed products or develop new products  and could reduce our net sales and profitability 
competition for licenses could require us to pay licensors higher royalties and higher minimum guaranteed payments in order to obtain or retain attractive licenses  which could increase our expenses 
in addition  licenses granted to other parties  whether or not exclusive  could limit our ability to market products  including products we currently market  which could cause our net sales and profitability to decline 
trademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs 
we have from time to time received claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property relating to certain of our products  and we may face similar claims in the future 
the defense of intellectual property litigation can be both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management  even if the claim is without merit 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation 
in addition  these claims could materially harm our brand name  reputation and operations 
we may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we may pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our mission and enable us to leverage our competitive strengths 
the integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks including possible failure to maintain customer  licensor and other relationships after the closing of the transaction of the acquired company  the acquired business may experience losses which could adversely affect our profitability  unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses  difficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net sales  diversion of management s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations  and unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition  or possible failure to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer of licenses or other agreements of the acquired company 
additionally  we financed our acquisitions of kids line  lajobi and cocalo with senior debt financing 
this debt leverage  or additional leverage that may be incurred with any other future acquisitions  could adversely affect our profitability and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities
