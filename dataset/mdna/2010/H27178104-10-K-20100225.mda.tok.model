in january  we relocated our principal executive offices to geneva  switzerland 
business we operate through two business groups our global engineering and construction group  which we refer to as our global e c group  and our global power group 
our global e c group  which operates worldwide  designs  engineers and constructs onshore and offshore upstream oil and gas processing facilities  natural gas liquefaction facilities and receiving terminals  gas to liquids facilities  oil refining  chemical and petrochemical  pharmaceutical and biotechnology facilities and related infrastructure  including power generation and distribution facilities  and gasification facilities 
our global e c group provides engineering  project management and construction management services  and purchases equipment  materials and services from third party suppliers and contractors 
our global e c group is also involved in the design of facilities in new or developing market sectors  including carbon capture and storage  solid fuel fired integrated gasification combined cycle power plants  coal to liquids  coal to chemicals and biofuels 
our global e c group owns one of the leading refinery residue upgrading technologies referred to as delayed coking and a hydrogen production process used in oil refineries and petrochemical plants 
additionally  our global e c group has experience with  and is able to work with  a wide range of processes owned by others 
our global e c group also designs and supplies direct fired furnaces  including fired heaters and waste heat recovery generators  used in a range of refinery  chemical  petrochemical  oil and gas processes  including furnaces used in its proprietary delayed coking and hydrogen production technologies 
in addition  our global e c group performs environmental remediation services  together with related technical  engineering  design and regulatory services 
our global e c group is also involved in the development  engineering  construction  ownership and operation of power generation facilities  from conventional and renewable sources  and of waste to energy facilities in europe 
our global e c group generates revenues from engineering and construction activities pursuant to contracts spanning up to approximately four years in duration and from returns on its equity investments in various power production facilities 

table of contents our global power group designs  manufactures and erects steam generating and auxiliary equipment for electric power generating stations and industrial facilities worldwide 
our steam generating equipment includes a full range of technologies  offering independent power producers  utility and industrial clients high value technology solutions for economically converting a wide range of fuels  including coal  lignite  petroleum coke  oil  gas  biomass and municipal solid waste  into high quality steam and power 
our circulating fluidized bed steam generator technology  which we refer to as cfb  is ideally suited to burning a very wide range of fuels  including low quality and waste type fuels  and we believe is generally recognized as one of the cleanest burning solid fuel technologies available on a commercial basis in the world today 
for both our cfb and pulverized coal  which we refer to as pc  steam generators  we offer supercritical once through unit designs to further improve the energy efficiency and  therefore  the environmental performance of these units 
once through supercritical steam generators operate at higher steam pressures than traditional plants  which results in higher efficiencies and lower emissions  including emissions of carbon dioxide  or co  which is considered a greenhouse gas 
further  for the longer term  we are actively developing flexi burn tm technology for our cfb steam generators 
we believe flexi burn tm technology will be an important part of an overall strategy for capturing and storing co from coal power plants 
this technology will enable our cfb steam generators to operate in oxygen firing cocapture mode  commonly referred to as oxy fuel combustion 
in this mode  the cfb combustion process will produce a co rich flue gas which can then be delivered to a storage location while avoiding the need for large  expensive and energy intensive post combustion coseparation equipment 
we also design  manufacture and install auxiliary equipment  which includes steam generators for solar thermal power plants  feedwater heaters  steam condensers and heat recovery equipment 
our global power group also offers a full line of new and retrofit nitrogen oxide  which we refer to as nox  reduction systems such as selective non catalytic and catalytic nox reduction systems as well as complete low noxcombustion systems

table of contents design and engineering our global e c group provides a broad range of engineering and design related services 
our design and engineering capabilities include process  civil  structural  architectural  mechanical  instrumentation  electrical  and health  safety and environmental management 
for each project  we identify the project requirements and then integrate and coordinate the various design elements 
other critical tasks in the design process may include value engineering to optimize costs  risk and hazard reviews  and the assessment of construction  maintenance and operational requirements 
project management and project control our global e c group offers a wide range of project management and project control services for overseeing engineering  procurement and construction activities 
these services include estimating costs  project planning and project cost control 
the provision of these services is an integral part of the planning  design and construction phases of projects that we execute directly for clients 
we also provide these services to our clients in the role of project management or program management consultant  where we oversee  on our client s behalf  the execution by other contractors of all or some of the planning  design and construction phases of a project 
procurement our procurement activities focus on those projects where we also execute the design and engineering work 
we manage the procurement of materials  subcontractors and craft labor 
often  we purchase materials  equipment and third party services on behalf of our client  where the client will pay for the purchased items or services at cost and reimburse us the cost of our associated services plus a margin or fee 
construction commissioning and start up our global e c group provides construction and construction management services on a worldwide basis 
our construction  commissioning and start up activities focus on those projects where we have performed most of the associated design and engineering work 
depending on the project  we may function as the primary contractor or as a subcontractor to another firm 
on some projects  we function as the construction manager  engaged by the customer to oversee another contractor s compliance with design specifications and contracting terms 
in some instances  we have responsibility for commissioning and plant start up  or  where the client has responsibility for these activities  we provide experts to work as part of our client s team 
operations and maintenance our global e c group provides project management  plant operations and maintenance services  such as repair  renovation  predictive and preventative services and other aftermarket services 
in some instances  our contracts may require us to operate a plant  which we have designed and built  for an initial period that may vary from a very short period to up to approximately two years 
fired heaters our global e c group designs and supplies direct fired furnaces used in a wide range of refining  petrochemical  chemical  oil and gas processes  including fired heaters and waste heat recovery units 
in addition  our global e c group also designs and supplies fired heaters which form an integral part of its proprietary delayed coking and hydrogen production technologies 
the principal products of our global power group are steam generators  commonly referred to as boilers 
our steam generators produce steam in a range of conditions and qualities  from low pressure saturated steam to high quality superheated steam at either sub critical or supercritical conditions steam pressures above approximately  pounds force per square inch absolute 
the steam produced by steam generators can be used to produce electricity in power plants  to heat buildings and in the production of many manufactured goods and products  such as paper  chemicals and food products 
our steam generators convert the energy of a wide range of solid and liquid fuels  as well as hot process gases  into steam and can be classified into several types circulating fluidized bed  pulverized coal  oil and natural gas  grate  heat recovery steam generators and fully assembled package boilers 
the two most significant elements of our product portfolio are our cfb and pc steam generators 
our global power group s products and services include circulating fluidized bed steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies steam generators that utilize our proprietary cfb technology 
we believe that cfb combustion 
table of contents is generally recognized as one of the most commercially viable  fuel flexible and clean burning ways to generate steam on a commercial basis from coal and many other solid fuels and waste products 
a cfb steam generator utilizes air nozzles on the floor and lower side walls of its furnace to mix and fluidize the fuel particles as they burn  resulting in a very efficient combustion and heat transfer process 
the fuel and other added solid materials  such as limestone  are continuously recycled through the furnace to maximize combustion efficiency and the capture of pollutants  such as the oxides of sulfur  which we refer to as sox 
due to the efficient mixing of the fuel with the air and other solid materials and the long period of time the fuel remains in the combustion process  the temperature of the process can be greatly reduced below that of a conventional burning process 
this has the added benefit of reducing the formation of nox  which is another pollutant formed during the combustion process 
due to these benefits  additional sox and sox control systems are frequently not needed 
the application of supercritical steam technology to cfb technology is the latest technical development 
by dramatically raising the pressure of the water as it is converted to steam  supercritical steam technology allows the steam to absorb more heat from the combustion process  resulting in a substantial improvement of approximately in the efficiency of an electric power plant 
as discussed above  we are actively developing flexi burn tm technology for our cfb steam generators 
we believe flexi burn tm technology will be an important part of an overall strategy for capturing and storing co from coal power plants 
we sell our cfb steam generators to clients worldwide 
pulverized coal steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies pc steam generators 
pc steam generators are commonly used in large coal fired power plant applications 
the coal is pulverized into fine particles and injected through specially designed low nox burners 
our pc steam generators control nox by utilizing advanced low nox combustion technology and selective catalytic reduction technology  which we refer to as scr 
pc technology requires flue gas desulfurization equipment  which we refer to as fgd  to be installed after the steam generator to capture sox 
we offer our pc steam generators with either conventional sub critical steam technology or more efficient supercritical steam technology for electric power plant applications 
we sell our pc steam generators to clients worldwide 
industrial steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies industrial steam generators of various types including cfb  as described above  grate  fully assembled package  field erected oil and gas  waste heat  and heat recovery steam generators 
depending on the steam generator type and application  our industrial boilers are designed to burn a wide spectrum of industrial fuels from high quality oil and natural gas to biomass and waste type fuels such as tires  municipal solid waste  waste wood and paper 
our industrial steam generators are designed for ruggedness and reliability 
auxiliary equipment and aftermarket services our global power group also manufactures and installs auxiliary and replacement equipment for utility power and industrial facilities  including steam generators for solar thermal power plants  surface condensers  feed water heaters  coal pulverizers  steam generator coils and panels  biomass gasifiers  and replacement parts 
additionally  we install noxreduction systems manufactured by third parties 
the nox reduction systems include scr equipment and low nox combustion systems for pc steam generators  which significantly reduce nox emissions from pc steam generators

table of contents item a 
risk factors amounts in thousands of dollars our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
if any of these events occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our securities could decline 
the following discussion of risks relating to our business should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
for additional information regarding forward looking statements  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement 
the categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories 
any adverse effects related to the risks discussed below may  and likely will  adversely affect many aspects of our business 
risks related to our operations our current and future lump sum or fixed price contracts and other shared risk contracts may result in significant losses if costs are greater than anticipated 
some of our contracts are fixed price contracts and other shared risk contracts that are inherently risky because we agree to the selling price of the project at the time we enter into the contract 
the selling price is based on estimates of the ultimate cost of the contract and we assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing the project  as well as the post completion warranty obligations 
certain of these contracts are lump sum turnkey projects where we are responsible for all aspects of the work from engineering through construction  as well as commissioning  all for a fixed selling price 
as of december   our backlog included  attributable to lump sum turnkey and other fixed price contracts  which represented of our total backlog 
in addition  we assume the project s technical risk and associated warranty obligations on all of our contracts and projects  meaning that we must tailor products and systems to satisfy the technical requirements of a project even though  at the time the project is awarded  we may not have previously produced such a product or system 
warranty obligations can range from re performance of engineering services to modification or replacement of equipment 
we also assume the risks related to revenue  cost and gross profit realized on such contracts that can vary  sometimes substantially  from the original projections due to changes in a variety of other factors  including but not limited to engineering design changes  unanticipated technical problems with the equipment being supplied or developed by us  which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem  changes in the costs of components  materials or labor  difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals  changes in local laws and regulations  changes in local labor conditions  project modifications creating unanticipated costs  delays caused by local weather conditions  and our project owners  suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform 
these risks may be exacerbated by the length of time between signing a contract and completing the project because most of the projects that we execute are long term 
the term of our contracts can be as long as approximately four years 
in addition  we sometimes bear the risk of delays caused by unexpected conditions or events 
we may be subject to penalties if portions of the long term fixed priced projects are not completed in accordance with agreed upon time limits 
therefore  significant losses can result from performing 
table of contents large  long term projects on a fixed price or lump sum basis 
these losses may be material  including in some cases up to or exceeding the full contract value in certain events of non performance  and could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may increase the size and number of fixed price or lump sum turnkey contracts  sometimes in countries where or with clients with whom we have limited previous experience 
we may bid for and enter into such contracts through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties 
this may increase our ability and willingness to bid for increased numbers of contracts and or increased size of contracts 
in addition  in some cases  applicable law and joint venture or other agreements may provide that each joint venture partner is jointly and severally liable for all liabilities of the venture 
entering into these partnerships or joint ventures will expose us to credit and performance risks of those third party partners  which could have a negative impact on our business and our results of operations if these parties fail to perform under the arrangements 
failure by us to successfully defend against claims made against us by project owners  suppliers or project subcontractors  or failure by us to recover adequately on claims made against project owners  suppliers or subcontractors  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our projects generally involve complex design and engineering  significant procurement of equipment and supplies and construction management 
we may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering  equipment and supply delivery  schedule changes and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that affect our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule or to meet the contractual performance obligations 
in addition  we generally rely on third party partners  equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to assist us with the completion of our contracts 
as such  claims involving project owners  suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us and by us in connection with our project contracts 
claims brought against us include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work  breaches of warranty and or late completion of the project work and claims for cancelled projects 
the claims and back charges can involve actual damages  as well as contractually agreed upon liquidated sums 
claims brought by us against project owners include claims for additional costs incurred in excess of current contract provisions arising out of project delays and changes in the previously agreed scope of work 
claims between us and our suppliers  subcontractors and vendors include claims like any of those described above 
these project claims  if not resolved through negotiation  are often subject to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings 
charges associated with claims could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for further information on project claims  please refer to note  litigation and uncertainties  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
projects included in our backlog may be delayed or cancelled  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the dollar amount of backlog does not necessarily indicate future earnings related to the performance of that work 
backlog refers to expected future revenues under signed contracts and legally binding letters of intent that we have determined are likely to be performed 
backlog represents only business that is considered firm  although cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur 
because of changes in project scope and schedule  we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed or the associated revenue will be recognized 
in addition  even where a project proceeds as scheduled  it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
because our operations are concentrated in four particular industries  we may be adversely impacted by economic or other developments in these industries 
we derive a significant amount of revenues from services provided to clients that are concentrated in four industries oil and gas  oil refining  chemical petrochemical and power generation 
these industries historically 
table of contents have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  depending on the demand for our products and services from these industries 
unfavorable developments in global or regional economic growth rates or other unfavorable developments in one or more of these industries could adversely affect our clients investment plans and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the weakness in the global economy is impacting the demand for the products that our global e c group s clients produce 
we have seen instances of postponement or cancellation of prospects  resizing of prospective projects to make them more economically viable and intensified competition among engineering and construction contractors which has resulted in pricing pressure 
these factors may continue in the future 
in our global power group business  new order activity has been unfavorably affected by several trends which began in fiscal year  continued during fiscal year and which may continue in the future 
these trends include weakness in the global economy and its impact on the near term growth in demand for electricity  political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators and the depressed level of natural gas pricing experienced in fiscal years and  which increased the attractiveness of that fuel  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity 
in addition  the constraints on the global credit market are impacting  and may continue to impact  some of our global e c group s and global power group s clients investment plans as these clients are affected by the availability and cost of financing  as well as their own financial strategies  which could include cash conservation 
our results of operations and cash flows depend on new contract awards  and the selection process and timing for performing these contracts are not entirely within our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from new contract awards of projects 
it is difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards due to the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
we often compete with other general and specialty contractors  both us and us  including large international contractors and small local contractors 
the strong competition in our markets requires us to maintain skilled personnel and invest in technology  and also puts pressure on our profit margins 
because of this  we could be prevented from obtaining contracts for which we have bid due to price  greater perceived financial strength and resources of our competitors and or perceived technology advantages 
alternatively  we may have to agree to lower prices and margins for contracts that we win or we may lose a bid or decide not to pursue a contract if the profit margins are below our minimum acceptable margins based on our risk assessment of the project conditions 
our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  certain of these contracts are subject to client financing contingencies and environmental permits  and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing and approvals for the project  which could result in a delay or cancellation of the proposed project and thereby reduce our revenues and profits 
a failure by us to attract and retain key officers  qualified personnel  joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to attract and retain key officers  qualified engineers and other professional personnel  as well as joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors  will be an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive and we may not be successful in efforts to attract and retain these individuals 
failure to attract or retain these key officers  professionals  joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our worldwide operations involve risks that may limit or disrupt operations  limit repatriation of cash  increase taxation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have worldwide operations that are conducted through us and non us subsidiaries  as well as through agreements with joint venture partners 
our non us subsidiaries  which accounted for approximately of our operating revenues and a majority of our operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended december   have operations located in asia  australia  europe  the middle east  south africa and south america 
additionally  we purchase materials and equipment on a worldwide basis and are heavily dependent on unrelated third party non us sources for these materials and equipment 
our worldwide operations are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including uncertain political  legal and economic environments  potential incompatibility with non us joint venture partners  foreign currency controls and fluctuations  energy prices and availability  terrorist attacks  the imposition of additional governmental controls and regulations  war and civil disturbances  labor problems  and interruption or delays in international shipping 
because of these risks  our worldwide operations and our execution of projects may be limited  or disrupted  our contractual rights may not be enforced fully or at all  our non us taxation may be increased  or we may be limited in repatriating earnings 
these potential events and liabilities could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to anti bribery laws in the countries in which we operate 
failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities 
many of the countries in which we transact business have laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action 
we are subject to these laws in addition to being governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act restricting these types of activities 
in addition to prohibiting certain bribery related activity with foreign officials and other persons  these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws and we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance 
however  any failure by us  our subcontractors  agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties 
the failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals  and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and other countries  
table of contents that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes 
we cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties  the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us  including increasing our tax burden  increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may be materially adversely impacted by regional  national and or global requirements to significantly limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future 
greenhouse gases that result from human activities  including burning of fossil fuels  have been the focus of increased scientific and political scrutiny and are being subjected to various legal requirements 
international agreements  national laws  state laws and various regulatory schemes limit or otherwise regulate emissions of greenhouse gases  and additional restrictions are under consideration by different governmental entities 
we derive a significant amount of revenues and contract profits from engineering and construction services provided to clients that own and or operate a wide range of process plants and from the supply of our manufactured equipment to clients that own and or operate electric power generating plants 
additionally  we own or partially own plants that generate electricity from burning natural gas or various types of solid fuels 
these plants emit greenhouse gases as part of the process to generate electricity or other products 
compliance with the existing greenhouse gas regulations may prove costly or difficult 
it is possible that owners and operators of existing or future process plants and electric generating plants could be subject to new or changed environmental regulations that result in significantly limiting or reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions  increasing the cost of emitting such gases or requiring emissions allowances 
the costs of controlling such emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances could be significant 
it also is possible that necessary controls or allowances may not be available 
such regulations could negatively impact client investments in capital projects in our markets  which could negatively impact the market for our manufactured products and certain of our services  and also could negatively affect the operations and profitability of our own electric power plants 
this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may incur significant costs and penalties that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations are subject to us  european and other laws and regulations governing the generation  management and use of regulated materials  the discharge of materials into the environment  the remediation of environmental contamination  or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
both our global e c group and our global power group make use of and produce as wastes or byproducts substances that are considered to be hazardous under these environmental laws and regulations 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination as an owner or operator or former owner or operator of a facility or as a generator of hazardous substances without regard to negligence or fault  and we are subject to additional liabilities if we do not comply with applicable laws regulating such hazardous substances  and  in either case  such liabilities can be substantial 
these laws and regulations could expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of current and past operations or conditions  including those associated with formerly owned or operated properties caused by us or others  or for acts by us or others which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in some cases  we have assumed contractual indemnification obligations for environmental liabilities associated with some formerly owned properties 
the ongoing costs of complying with existing environmental laws and regulations could be substantial 
additionally  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury  property damage or natural resource damages as a result of alleged exposure to or contamination by hazardous substances 
changes in the environmental laws and regulations  remediation obligations  enforcement actions  stricter interpretations of existing requirements  future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons  property  natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate 

table of contents we may lose future business to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our proprietary products 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights to the technologies and know how used in our proprietary products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of trade secret  unfair competition and similar laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot provide assurance that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
we also hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
we rely on our information systems in our operations 
failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time  our business could be harmed 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems 
information systems are vulnerable to internal and external security breaches including by computer hackers and cyber terrorists 
the unavailability of the information systems  the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
risks related to asbestos claims the number and cost of our current and future asbestos claims in the united states could be substantially higher than we have estimated and the timing of payment of claims could be sooner than we have estimated  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits and out of court administrative claims pending in the united states in which the plaintiffs claim damages for alleged bodily injury or death arising from exposure to asbestos in connection with work performed  or heat exchange devices assembled  installed and or sold  by our subsidiaries 
we expect these subsidiaries to be named as defendants in similar suits and that claims will be brought in the future 
for purposes of our financial statements  we have estimated the indemnity and defense costs to be incurred in resolving pending and forecasted us claims through fiscal year although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the actual number of future claims brought against us and the cost of resolving these claims could be substantially higher than our estimates 
some of the factors that may result in the costs of asbestos claims being higher than our current estimates include the rate at which new claims are filed  the number of new claimants  changes in the mix of diseases alleged to be suffered by the claimants  such as type of cancer  asbestosis or other illness  increases in legal fees or other defense costs associated with asbestos claims  increases in indemnity payments  decreases in the proportion of claims dismissed with zero indemnity payments  indemnity payments being required to be made sooner than expected  
table of contents bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants  causing a reduction in the number of available solvent defendants and thereby increasing the number of claims and the size of demands against our subsidiaries  adverse jury verdicts requiring us to pay damages in amounts greater than we expect to pay in settlements  changes in legislative or judicial standards that make successful defense of claims against our subsidiaries more difficult  or enactment of federal legislation requiring us to contribute amounts to a national settlement trust in excess of our expected net liability  after insurance  in the tort system 
the total liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  is based on estimated indemnity and defense costs expected to be incurred through fiscal year we believe that it is likely that there will be new claims filed after fiscal year  but in light of uncertainties inherent in long term forecasts  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate the indemnity and defense costs that might be incurred after fiscal year our forecast contemplates that the number of new claims requiring indemnity will decline from year to year 
if future claims fail to decline as we expect  our aggregate liability for asbestos claims will be higher than estimated 
since fiscal year end  we have worked with analysis research planning corporation  or arpc  nationally recognized consultants in the united states with respect to projecting asbestos liabilities  to estimate the amount of asbestos related indemnity and defense costs 
arpc reviews our asbestos indemnity payments  defense costs and claims activity and compares them to our year forecast prepared at the previous year end 
based on its review  arpc may recommend that the assumptions used to estimate our future asbestos liability be updated  as appropriate 
our forecast of the number of future claims is based  in part  on a regression model  which employs the statistical analysis of our historical claims data to generate a trend line for future claims and  in part  on an analysis of future disease incidence 
although we believe this forecast method is reasonable  other forecast methods that attempt to estimate the population of living persons who could claim they were exposed to asbestos at worksites where our subsidiaries performed work or sold equipment could also be used and might project higher numbers of future claims than our forecast 
the actual number of future claims  the mix of disease types and the amounts of indemnity and defense costs may exceed our current estimates 
we update our forecasts at least annually to take into consideration recent claims experience and other developments  such as legislation and litigation outcomes  that may affect our estimates of future asbestos related costs 
the announcement of increases to asbestos liabilities as a result of revised forecasts  adverse jury verdicts or other negative developments involving asbestos litigation or insurance recoveries may cause the value or trading prices of our securities to decrease significantly 
these negative developments could also negatively impact our liquidity  cause us to default under covenants in our indebtedness  cause our credit ratings to be downgraded  restrict our access to capital markets or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the adequacy and timing of insurance recoveries of our asbestos related costs in the united states is uncertain 
the failure to obtain insurance recoveries could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
although we believe that a significant portion of our subsidiaries liability and defense costs for asbestos claims will be covered by insurance  the adequacy and timing of insurance recoveries is uncertain 
since fiscal year end  we have worked with peterson risk consulting llc  nationally recognized experts in the united states with respect to the estimation of insurance recoveries  to annually review our estimate of the value of the settled insurance asset and assist in the estimation of our unsettled asbestos related insurance asset 

table of contents the asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  represents our best estimate of settled and probable future insurance settlements relating to our us liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims through fiscal year the insurance asset includes an estimate of the amount of recoveries under existing settlements with other insurers 
certain of our subsidiaries have entered into settlement agreements calling for certain insurers to make lump sum payments  as well as payments over time  for use by our subsidiaries to fund asbestos related indemnity and defense costs and  in certain cases  for reimbursement for portions of out of pocket costs that we previously have incurred 
we entered into an additional settlement in the fiscal year ended december  and we intend to continue to attempt to negotiate additional settlements where achievable on a reasonable basis in order to minimize the amount of future costs that we would be required to fund out of the cash flows generated from our operations 
unless we settle the remaining unsettled insurance asset at amounts significantly in excess of our current estimates  it is likely that the amount of our insurance settlements will not cover all future asbestos related costs and we will continue to fund a portion of such future costs  which will reduce our cash flows and our working capital 
additionally  certain of the settlements with insurance companies during the past several years were for fixed dollar amounts that do not change as the liability changes 
accordingly  increases in the asbestos liability will not result in an equal increase in the insurance asset 
our insurance recoveries may be limited by future insolvencies among our insurers 
we have not assumed recovery in the estimate of our asbestos related insurance asset from any of our currently insolvent insurers 
other insurers may become insolvent in the future and our insurers may fail to reimburse amounts owed to us on a timely basis 
if we fail to realize expected insurance recoveries  or experience delays in receiving material amounts from our insurers  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
a number of asbestos related claims have been received by our subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
to date  these claims have been covered by insurance policies and proceeds from the policies have been paid directly to the plaintiffs 
the timing and amount of asbestos claims that may be made in the future  the financial solvency of the insurers and the amount that may be paid to resolve the claims are uncertain 
the insurance carriers failure to make payments due under the policies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom have received claims alleging personal injury arising from exposure to asbestos in connection with work performed  or heat exchange devices assembled  installed and or sold  by our subsidiaries 
we expect these subsidiaries to be named as defendants in additional suits and claims brought in the future 
to date  insurance policies have provided coverage for substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with resolving asbestos claims in the united kingdom 
in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   we have recorded uk asbestos related insurance recoveries equal to the uk asbestos related liabilities  which are comprised of an estimated liability relating to open outstanding claims and an estimated liability relating to future unasserted claims through fiscal year our ability to continue to recover under these insurance policies is dependent upon  among other things  the timing and amount of asbestos claims that may be made in the future  the financial solvency of our insurers and the amount that may be paid to resolve the claims 
these factors could significantly limit our insurance recoveries  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our liquidity and capital resources we require cash repatriations from our subsidiaries to meet our cash needs related to our asbestos related and other liabilities  corporate overhead expenses and share repurchases 
our ability to repatriate funds from our subsidiaries is limited by a number of factors 
as a holding company  we are dependent on cash inflows from our subsidiaries in order to fund our asbestos related and other liabilities and corporate overhead expenses 
to the extent that our us subsidiaries do not generate enough cash flows to cover our holding company payments and expenses in the us  we are 
table of contents dependent on cash repatriations from our non us subsidiaries 
additionally  we are dependent on cash repatriations to cover essentially all payments and expenses of our holding company in switzerland and at our discretion  the acquisition of our shares under our share repurchase program by our holding company domiciled in switzerland 
there can be no assurance that the forecasted cash repatriations will occur as our subsidiaries need to keep certain amounts available for working capital purposes  to pay known liabilities  to comply with covenants and for other general corporate purposes 
the repatriation of funds may also subject those funds to taxation in some jurisdictions 
the inability to repatriate cash could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
certain of our various debt agreements impose financial covenants  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities  which could negatively impact our business 
our us senior credit agreement imposes financial covenants on us 
these covenants limit our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments and sell assets 
these limitations may restrict our ability to pursue business opportunities  which could negatively impact our business 
we may have significant working capital requirements  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and cash flows 
in some cases  we may require significant amounts of working capital to finance the purchase of materials and in the performance of engineering  construction and other work on certain of our projects before we receive payment from our customers 
in some cases  we are contractually obligated to our customers to fund working capital on our projects 
increases in working capital requirements could negatively impact our business  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  we may invest some of our cash in longer term investment opportunities  including  as described below  the acquisition of other entities or operations  the reduction of certain liabilities such as unfunded pension liabilities and or repurchases of our outstanding registered shares 
to the extent we use cash for such other purposes  the amount of cash available for the working capital needs described above would be reduced 
our new contract awards  current projects and liquidity may be adversely affected by the availability and or cost of our performance related standby letters of credit  bank guarantees  surety bonds and other guarantee facilities 
consistent with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance related standby letters of credit  bank guarantees  surety bonds or other forms of performance related guarantees to clients  which we refer to as bonds or bonding 
these bonds provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under our contract 
a restriction  reduction  termination and or increase in the cost of our bonding facilities may limit our ability to bid on new project awards  delay work on current projects or significantly change the timing of cash flows for current projects  adversely affecting our liquidity 
additionally  in the event our credit ratings are lowered by independent rating agencies  such as standard poor s or moody s investors service  it may be more difficult or costly for us to obtain bonding for new awards or maintain such bonding on current projects 
we may also be required to provide or increase cash collateral to obtain these bonds  which would reduce our available cash and could impact our ability to renew or increase availability under our us senior credit agreement or other bonding facilities 
we are also subject to the risk that any new or amended bonding facilities might not be on terms as favorable as those we have currently  which could adversely affect our liquidity 

table of contents we may invest in longer term investment opportunities  such as the acquisition of other entities or operations in the engineering and construction industry or power industry 
acquisitions of other entities or operations have risks that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in fiscal year  we completed two acquisitions and have been exploring other possible acquisitions within the engineering and construction industry to strategically complement or expand on our technical capabilities or access to new market segments 
we have also been exploring possible acquisitions within the power industry to complement our product offering 
the acquisition of companies and assets in the engineering and construction and power industries is subject to substantial risks  including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence  the risk of over paying for assets and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired 
further  the integration and consolidation of acquisitions require substantial human  financial and other resources including management time and attention  and ultimately  our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated and or our resources may be diverted 
there can be no assurances that we will consummate any such future acquisitions  that any acquisitions we make will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the investment required to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them 
risk factors related to our financial reporting and corporate governance if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected 
although we had no material weaknesses as of december   we have reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past 
there can be no assurance that we will avoid a material weakness in the future 
if we have another material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future  it could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner 
our use of the percentage of completion accounting method could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
a substantial portion of our revenues is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
revisions to estimated revenues and estimated costs can and do result in changes to revenues  costs and profits

registered holders who acquired our shares after the redomestication must apply for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights in order to have voting rights  we may deny such registration under certain circumstances 
to be able to exercise voting rights  registered holders of our shares who acquired our shares after the redomestication must apply to us for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights 
our board of directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds 
in particular  under our articles of association  no shareholder will generally not be registered with voting rights for or more of our share capital as recorded in the commercial register 
only shareholders that are registered as shareholders with voting rights on the relevant record date are permitted to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting 
registered holders who received our shares as a result of the redomestication are registered as shareholders with voting rights and shareholders who hold in street name will be entitled to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting through cede co 

table of contents there are provisions in our articles of association that may reduce the voting rights of our registered shares 
our articles of association provide that shareholders have one vote for each registered share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  our articles of association provide that shareholders whose controlled shares as defined in the articles of association represent or more of our total voting shares are limited to voting one vote less than of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the commercial register 
this provision is intended to prevent the possibility of our company becoming a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes  which could have certain adverse us federal income tax consequences to us persons who own directly  indirectly or under applicable constructive ownership rules or more of our voting shares 
it may also have an anti takeover effect by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
following the redomestication  as a result of the higher par value of our shares  we have less flexibility than we had prior to the redomestication with respect to certain aspects of capital management 
the par value of our shares is chf per share 
the par value of foster wheeler ltd 
s common shares was per share 
under swiss law  we may not issue our shares below par value 
as of february   the closing price of our registered shares on the nasdaq global select market was  and chf was equivalent to approximately based on a foreign exchange rate of chf to on such date 
in the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares  we will be unable to issue shares 
in addition  we will not be able to issue options under our various compensation and benefits plans with an exercise price below the par value  which would limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements 
following the redomestication  as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements  we have less flexibility than we had before the redomestication with respect to certain aspects of capital management 
under bermuda law  foster wheeler ltd 
s directors were able to issue  without shareholder approval  any common shares authorized in foster wheeler ltd 
s memorandum of association that were not issued or reserved 
bermuda law also provided the board of directors with substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred shares 
in addition  foster wheeler ltd 
s board of directors had the right  subject to statutory limitations  to declare and pay dividends on foster wheeler ltd 
s common shares without a shareholder vote 
swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without shareholder approval  but our authorization is presently limited to chf  divided into  registered shares with a par value of chf per share and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years 
additionally  subject to specified exceptions  including the exceptions described in our articles of association  swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities 
swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares 
for example  while the board of directors of foster wheeler ltd 
could authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  we may not issue preferred stock without the approval of of the votes cast and a majority of the par value of the registered shares represented at a general meeting of our shareholders 
swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which foster wheeler ltd 
s board of directors had authority 
for example  dividends must be approved by shareholders 
while we do not believe that the differences between bermuda law and swiss law relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on us  we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 
the anticipated benefits of moving our principal executive offices to switzerland may not be realized  and difficulties in connection with moving our operating headquarters could have an adverse effect on us 
we relocated our operating headquarters from clinton  new jersey in the united states  to geneva  switzerland in january we may face significant challenges resulting from the relocation of our principal executive offices to a different country  including difficulties in retaining and attracting officers  key personnel and other employees 
management may also be required to devote substantial time to matters relating to the 
table of contents relocation  which could otherwise be devoted to focusing on ongoing business operations and other initiatives and opportunities 
in addition  we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the relocation  including the benefit derived from moving to a location that is more centrally located within our area of worldwide operations 
any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we elect to declare dividends  we would be required to declare such dividends in swiss francs and any currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc will affect the dollar value of the dividends we pay 
under swiss corporate law  if we elect to declare dividends  including distributions through a reduction in par value  we would be required to declare such dividends in swiss francs 
dividend payments will be made by our transfer agent in us dollars converted at the applicable exchange rate shortly before the payment date 
as a result  shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the date used for purposes of calculating the chf amount of any proposed dividend or par value reduction and the relevant payment date  which will not be shorter than two months and could be as long as a year 
we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 
if we are not successful in our efforts to make distributions  if any  through a reduction of par value or  based on current legislation  after january   pay dividends  if any  out of qualifying additional paid in capital  then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 
the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration 
a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income  which we refer to as the us swiss treaty  may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the treaty rate or in excess of the reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least participation in our voting stock  or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds 
payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to swiss withholding tax 
however  there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value  that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value  or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future 
in addition  over the long term  the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited 
if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or  based on current legislation  after january   pay a dividend out of qualifying additional paid in capital  we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
we have anti takeover provisions in our articles of association that may discourage a change of control 
our articles of association and swiss law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for the board of directors to be divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms 
in addition  directors may be removed from office  by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the issued shares generally entitled to vote 
these provisions of our articles of association may delay or limit the ability of a shareholder to obtain majority representation on the board of directors 
limiting the voting rights of shareholders whose controlled shares as defined in the articles of association represent or more of our total voting shares to one vote less than of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the swiss commercial register 
under swiss corporate law  merger and demerger transactions require the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the shares represented at the applicable shareholders meeting 
in addition  under certain circumstances for example  in the case of so called cashout or squeezeout mergers a merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of shares 
any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as a director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to our corporate secretary 

table of contents these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
we are a swiss company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
foster wheeler ag is a swiss corporation 
as a result  the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and by our articles of association and organizational regulations 
the rights of shareholders under swiss law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies of other jurisdictions 
a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
it may be difficult for investors to enforce in the united states judgments obtained in us courts against us or our directors based on the civil liability provisions of the us securities laws 
uncertainty exists as to whether courts in switzerland will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including in the united states  under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in switzerland under the securities laws of other jurisdictions

please refer to the section entitled results of operations below for further discussion of the above noted drivers that impacted net income attributable to foster wheeler ag 
challenges and drivers our primary operating focus continues to be booking quality new business and executing our contracts well 
the global markets in which we operate are largely dependent on overall economic growth and the resultant demand for oil and gas  electric power  petrochemicals and refined products 
in our global e c business  we expect long term demand to be strong for the end products produced by our clients  and to continue to stimulate investment by our clients in new and expanded plants 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the current weakness in the global economy has caused many of our e c clients to reevaluate the size  timing and scope of their capital spending plans in relation to the kinds of energy and petrochemical projects that we serve 
these factors may continue into fiscal year the challenges and drivers for our global e c group are discussed in more detail in the section entitled results of operations business segments global e c group overview of segment  within this item attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel to execute the existing backlog of unfilled orders and future bookings 
table of contents continues to be a management priority 
equally important is ensuring that we maintain an appropriate management infrastructure to integrate and manage the technical personnel 
in our global power group business  new order activity has been unfavorably affected by several trends which began in fiscal year  continued during fiscal year and which may continue in the future 
these trends include weakness in the global economy and its impact on the near term growth in demand for electricity  political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators and the depressed level of natural gas pricing experienced in fiscal years and  which increased the attractiveness of that fuel  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity

contract profit fiscal years ended december  december  december  amount change change contract profit is computed as operating revenues less cost of operating revenues

provision for income taxes fiscal years ended december  december  december  amount change change effective tax rate our effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may differ significantly from the us federal statutory rate as a result of income taxed in various non us jurisdictions with rates different from the us statutory rate  as a result of our inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses generated by certain unprofitable operations and as a result of the varying mix of income earned in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
in periods when operating units subject to a valuation allowance generate pretax earnings  the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance favorably impacts our effective tax rate 
conversely  in periods when operating units subject to a valuation allowance generate pretax losses  the corresponding increase in the valuation allowance has an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate 
fiscal year our effective tax rate for fiscal year was lower than the us statutory rate of due principally to the net impact of income earned in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate  which contributed to an approximate percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year our effective tax rate for fiscal year was lower than the us statutory rate of due principally to the impact of the following income earned in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate  which contributed to an approximate percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal year  and a valuation allowance decrease which consisted of a reversal of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in one of our non us subsidiaries and a decrease in our valuation allowance because we recognized earnings in jurisdictions where we had a full valuation allowance 
these factors which reduced the effective tax rate were partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in another of our non us subsidiaries and our inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses subject to valuation allowance in certain other jurisdictions and other permanent differences 
total changes in our valuation allowance contributed to an approximate six percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal year fiscal year our effective tax rate for fiscal year was lower than the us statutory rate of due principally to the impact of the following income earned in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate  which contributed to an approximate ten percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal year  and a valuation allowance decrease which contributed to an approximate two percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal year a decrease in our valuation allowance occurred in the fiscal year because we recognized earnings in jurisdictions where we had a full valuation allowance 
these variances were partially offset by losses in certain other jurisdictions for which no benefit is recognized a valuation allowance is established and other permanent differences 
we monitor the jurisdictions for which valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were established in previous years  and we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the need for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions 
such evaluation includes a review of all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
for statutory purposes  the majority of the us federal tax benefits  against which valuation allowances have been established  do not expire until fiscal year and beyond  based on current tax laws 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests fiscal years ended december  december  december  amount change change net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents third party ownership interests in the results of our global power group s martinez  california gas fired cogeneration subsidiary and our manufacturing subsidiaries in poland and the people s republic of china as well as our global e c group s subsidiary in south africa 
the change in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is based upon changes in the underlying earnings of these subsidiaries and or changes in noncontrolling interests ownership interest in the subsidiaries 

table of contents fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  compared to fiscal year  primarily resulted from increases of  from our operations in south africa and due to increased earnings from our operations in martinez  california

ebitda is a supplemental financial measure not defined in generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we define ebitda as income attributable to foster wheeler ag before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because we believe it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
certain covenants under our current and prior senior credit agreements use an adjusted form of ebitda such that in the covenant calculations the ebitda as presented herein is adjusted for certain unusual and infrequent items specifically excluded in the terms of our current and prior senior credit agreements 
we believe that the line item on the consolidated statement of operations entitled net income attributable to foster wheeler ag is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net income attributable to foster wheeler ag as an indicator of operating performance or any other gaap financial measure 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure 
table of contents does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information that is included in net income attributable to foster wheeler ag  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance some of our operations  interest is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations  it does not include taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations  and it does not include depreciation and amortization 
because we must utilize property  plant and equipment and intangible assets in order to generate revenues in our operations  depreciation and amortization are necessary and ongoing costs of our operations 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization has material limitations

overview of segment our global e c group  which operates worldwide  designs  engineers and constructs onshore and offshore upstream oil and gas processing facilities  natural gas liquefaction facilities and receiving terminals  gas to liquids facilities  oil refining  chemical and petrochemical  pharmaceutical and biotechnology facilities and related infrastructure  including power generation and distribution facilities  and gasification facilities 
our global e c group is also involved in the design of facilities in new or developing market sectors  including carbon capture and storage  solid fuel fired integrated gasification combined cycle power plants  coal to liquids  coal to chemicals and biofuels 
our global e c group generates revenues from engineering  procurement  construction and project management activities pursuant to contracts spanning up to approximately four years in duration and from returns on its equity investments in various power production facilities 
our global e c group owns one of the leading technologies delayed coking used in refinery residue upgrading and a hydrogen production process used in oil refineries and petrochemical plants 
the global e c group also designs and supplies direct fired furnaces  including fired heaters and waste heat recovery generators  used in a range of refinery  chemical  petrochemical  oil and gas processes  including furnaces used in its proprietary delayed coking and hydrogen production technologies 
additionally  our global e c group has experience with  and is able to work with  a wide range of processes owned by others 
although the global economy is showing signs of recovery  several of our clients are continuing to reevaluate the size  timing and scope of their capital spending plans in relation to the kinds of energy and petrochemical projects that we serve 
we have seen instances of postponement or cancellation of prospects  resizing of prospective projects to make them more economically viable and intensified competition among engineering and construction contractors which has resulted in pricing pressure 
these factors may continue into fiscal year in addition  the constraints on the global credit market are impacting and may continue to impact some of our clients investment plans as these clients are affected by the availability and cost of financing  as well as their own financial strategies  which could include cash conservation 
however  we continue to see projects moving forward and clients starting to re examine previously postponed projects to review the business cases for proceeding with such projects 
in addition  we believe world demand for energy and chemicals will continue to grow over the long term and that clients will continue to invest in new and upgraded capacity to meet that demand 
in that regard  we were successful in booking contracts for studies and front end engineering work in fiscal year  for example feed work at a lng project in australia  which is frequently the precursor to subsequent significant opportunities as projects move into the engineering  procurement and construction phase 
moreover  we have continued to be successful in booking contracts of varying types and sizes in our key end markets  including a very large award in fiscal year for the engineering  procurement and construction of a new refinery in india 
our success in this regard is a reflection of our technical expertise  our long term relationships with clients  and our selective approach in pursuit of new prospects where we believe we have significant differentiators

table of contents overview of segment our global power group designs  manufactures and erects steam generators for electric power generating stations  district heating plants and industrial facilities worldwide 
our competitive differentiation in serving these markets is the ability of our products to cleanly and efficiently burn a wide range of fuels  singularly or in combination 
in particular  our cfb steam generators are able to burn coal grades of varying quality  as well as petroleum coke  lignite  municipal waste  waste wood  biomass  and numerous other materials 
among these fuel sources  coal is the most widely used  and thus the market drivers and constraints associated with coal strongly affect the steam generator market and our global power group s business 
additionally  our global power group designs  manufactures and erects auxiliary equipment for electric power generating stations and industrial facilities worldwide and owns and or operates several cogeneration  independent power production and waste to energy facilities  as well as power generation facilities for the process and petrochemical industries 
in our global power group business  new order activity has been unfavorably affected by several trends which began in fiscal year  continued during fiscal year and which may continue in the future 
weakness in the global economy reduced the near term growth in demand for electricity 
in addition  political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators caused a number of our global power group s prospective projects to be postponed or cancelled as clients experienced difficulty in obtaining the required environmental permits or decided to wait for additional clarity regarding state and federal regulations 
this environmental concern has been especially pronounced in the united states  and to a lesser extent in europe  and is linked to the view that solid fuel fired steam generators contribute to global warming through the discharge of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere 
credit concerns among certain clients also contributed to the slowed pace of new contract awards in fiscal year in addition  the depressed level of natural gas pricing experienced in fiscal years and  increased the attractiveness of that fuel  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity 
finally  the constraints on the global credit market are impacting and may continue to impact some of our clients investment plans as these clients are affected by the availability and cost of financing  as well as their own financial strategies  which could include cash conservation 
we believe that the impact of these factors on global demand for new solid fuel steam generators  with the exception of political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators  may decrease in fiscal year and that the global demand for new solid fuel steam generators could begin to improve 
however  the severity of the impact on new contract awards in fiscal year is likely to impact our financial performance in fiscal year during the first fiscal quarter of  our global power group was notified of the termination of a previously awarded contract for the design and supply of two cfb steam generators for a us power project 
our global power group removed the contract from its backlog of unfilled orders in the first fiscal quarter of the amount removed from backlog represented approximately of our global power group s backlog as of the end of fiscal year longer term  we believe that world demand for electrical energy will continue to grow and that solid fuel fired steam generators will continue to fill a significant portion of the incremental growth in new generating capacity 
in addition  we are seeing a growing need to repower older coal plants with new clean coal plants driven by the need to improve environmental  economical  and reliability performance of mature coal plant fleets in such countries as the us  poland  and russia 
the fuel flexibility of our cfb steam generators enables them to burn a variety of fuels other than coal and to produce carbon neutral electricity when fired by biomass 
in addition  our utility steam generators can be designed to incorporate supercritical technology  which significantly improves power plant efficiency and reduces power plant emissions 
we have recently received an award to carry out the detail engineering  supply  assembly and commissioning for a cfb steam generator which will be used to research co capture through oxy fuel combustion utilizing our flexi burn tm technology 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources fiscal year activities during fiscal year  we generated  of cash flows from operating activities  which is net of contributions to our pension plans of  and experienced an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  due to the effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash equivalents  which were partially offset by capital expenditures of  and payments totaling approximately  primarily for two business acquisitions specializing in upstream oil and gas engineering services

cash flows from operating activities fiscal years ended december  december  december  amount change change the net cash provided by operations in fiscal year was attributable primarily to net income of  and non cash charges included in net income of  partially offset by cash used for working capital of  net payments for asbestos liability indemnity and defense costs in excess of proceeds from settlements with asbestos insurance carriers of  and mandatory and discretionary contributions to our us and us pension plans of  which included discretionary contributions of  and  to our us and us pension plans  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations resulted primarily from a decrease in net income of  which includes a gain and the related cash receipts of  on the settlement of coverage litigation with certain asbestos insurance carriers in fiscal year  and an increase in cash used for working capital of  partially offset by an increase in non cash charges included in net income of  and decreased mandatory and discretionary contributions to our us and us pension plans of  payments of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  which included discretionary contributions of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal year was relatively unchanged compared to fiscal year which was the net result of an increase in net income of  which includes a gain and the related cash receipts of  on the settlement of coverage litigation with certain asbestos insurance carriers in fiscal year  partially offset by a net increase in cash used for mandatory and discretionary contributions to our us and us pension plans of  payments of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  which included discretionary contributions of  and  in fiscal years 
table of contents and  respectively and a net reduction in cash flows of  to fund an increase in working capital net cash outflow for working capital increase of  versus net cash inflow generated from a reduction in working capital of  in fiscal years and  respectively 
working capital varies from period to period depending on the mix  stage of completion and commercial terms and conditions of our contracts and the timing of the related cash receipts 
our global e c group typically experiences a use of cash for working capital when the workload of reimbursable contracts increases since services are rendered prior to billing clients 
conversely  our global e c group typically experiences cash in flows from working capital when the workload of reimbursable contracts decreases as cash receipts from client billings exceed new services rendered 
our global power group typically experiences cash receipts from working capital when their workload increases as cash typically is received prior to ordering materials and equipment and rendering of services 
whereas  our global power group typically experiences a use of cash for working capital when their workload decreases as cash used for materials and equipment purchased and services rendered exceeds cash receipts from new client billings 
cash used for working capital in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  reflects an increase in cash used for working capital in our global power group  partially offset by a decrease in cash used for working capital in our global e c group 
our global power group s cash receipts in fiscal year from client billings decreased relative to cash used for materials and equipment purchased and services rendered that were billed and collected from clients in the prior fiscal year and resulted in an increase in cash used for working capital in fiscal year our global e c group experienced a decrease in new services rendered relative to cash receipts from client billings which resulted in a decrease in cash used for working capital in fiscal year as more fully described below in outlook  we believe our existing cash balances and forecasted net cash provided from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations throughout the next months 
our ability to increase or maintain our cash flows from operating activities in future periods will depend in large part on the demand for our products and services and our operating performance in the future

outlook our liquidity forecasts cover  among other analyses  existing cash balances  cash flows from operations  cash repatriations from non us entities  changes in working capital activities  unused credit line availability and claim recoveries and proceeds from asset sales  if any 
these forecasts extend over a rolling month period 
based on these forecasts  we believe our existing cash balances and forecasted net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations throughout the next months 
based on these forecasts  our primary cash needs will be working capital  capital expenditures  asbestos liability indemnity and defense costs and acquisitions 
we may also use cash to repurchase our shares under the share repurchase program that foster wheeler ag adopted as part of the redomestication  as described further below  under which we are authorized to repurchase up to  of our outstanding registered shares 
the majority of our cash balances are invested in short term interest bearing accounts with maturities of less than three months 
we continue to consider investing some of our cash in longer term investment opportunities  including the acquisition of other entities or operations in the engineering and construction industry or power industry and or the reduction of certain liabilities such as unfunded pension liabilities 
we may elect to make additional discretionary contributions to our us and or uk pension plans during fiscal year 
table of contents we continue to monitor our credit exposure in light of the global economic environment with respect to our counterparty credit exposure  in general  and specifically related to cash and cash equivalents  bonding and bank guarantees  forward currency contracts  pension assets  insurance assets and clients 
we believe that we are well diversified and third party credit exposure should not expose us to material downside risks 
it is customary in the industries in which we operate to provide standby letters of credit  bank guarantees or performance bonds in favor of clients to secure obligations under contracts 
we believe that we will have sufficient letter of credit capacity from existing facilities throughout the next months 
our us operating entities do not generate sufficient cash flows to fund our obligations related to corporate overhead expenses and asbestos related liabilities incurred in the us additionally  we are dependent on cash repatriations to cover essentially all payments and expenses of our switzerland based corporate overhead expenses and to fund the acquisition of our shares under our share repurchase program described below 
consequently  we require cash repatriations to the us and switzerland from our entities located in other countries in the normal course of our operations to meet our swiss and us cash needs and have successfully repatriated cash for many years 
we believe that we can repatriate the required amount of cash to the us and switzerland 
additionally  we continue to have access to the revolving credit portion of our us senior credit facility  if needed 
during fiscal year  we had net cash outflows  payments related to asbestos liability indemnity and defense costs in excess of insurance settlement proceeds  of  in fiscal year  we expect net cash outflows to be approximately  which assumes no additional settlements with insurance companies or elections by us to fund additional payments 
as we continue to collect cash from insurance settlements and assuming no increase in our asbestos related insurance liability or any future insurance settlements  the asbestos related insurance receivable recorded on our balance sheet will continue to decrease 
we have a senior credit agreement which provides for a facility of  and includes a provision which permits future incremental increases of up to  in total availability under the facility 
we had approximately  and  of letters of credit outstanding under our us senior credit agreement as of december  and december   respectively 
the letter of credit fees range from to  excluding a fronting fee of per annum 
we do not intend to borrow under our us senior revolving credit facility during fiscal year a portion of the letters of credit issued under the us senior credit agreement have performance pricing that is decreased or increased as a result of improvements or reductions in the credit rating assigned to the us senior credit agreement by moody s investors service and or standard poor s 
as a result of the improvement in our s p credit rating in march  we achieved  and continue to maintain  the lowest possible pricing under the performance pricing provisions of our us senior credit agreement 
this performance pricing is not expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources in fiscal year our us senior credit agreement expires on september   however  we may consider refinancing the agreement during fiscal year on december   foster wheeler ag  foster wheeler ltd  certain of foster wheeler ltd 
s subsidiaries and bnp paribas  as administrative agent  entered into an additional amendment of our us senior credit agreement 
the amendment includes a consent of the lenders under the credit agreement to the redomestication 
in addition  the amendment reflects the addition of foster wheeler ag as a guarantor of the obligations under the credit agreement and reflects changes relating to foster wheeler ag becoming the ultimate parent of foster wheeler ltd 
and its subsidiaries upon completion of the redomestication 
the amendment became effective upon consummation of the redomestication on february  we are not required to make any mandatory contributions to our us pension plans in fiscal year based on the minimum statutory funding requirements 
based on the minimum statutory funding requirements for fiscal year  we expect to make mandatory contributions totaling approximately  to our non us pension plans in fiscal year on september   we announced a share repurchase program pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to  of foster wheeler ltd 
s outstanding common shares 
in connection with the redomestication described in item  business the redomestication  foster wheeler ag adopted a share 
table of contents repurchase program pursuant to which it is authorized to repurchase up to  of its outstanding registered shares and designate the repurchased shares for cancellation 
the amount authorized for repurchase of registered shares under the foster wheeler ag program is equal to the amount that remained available for repurchases under the foster wheeler ltd 
program as of february   the date of the completion of the redomestication 
the foster wheeler ag program replaces the foster wheeler ltd 
program  and no further repurchases will be made under the foster wheeler ltd 
program 
any repurchases will be made at our discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions  share price and other factors 
the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular number of shares 
the program has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
any repurchases made pursuant to the share repurchase program will be funded using our cash on hand 
cumulatively through february   we have repurchased  under the foster wheeler ltd 
and foster wheeler ag programs   shares for an aggregate cost of approximately  which includes commissions of 
we have executed the repurchases in accordance with b repurchase plans as well as other open market purchases 
the b repurchase plans allow us to purchase shares at times when we may not otherwise do so due to regulatory or internal restrictions 
purchases under the b repurchase plans are based on parameters set forth in the plans 
we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since july and we do not have any plans to declare or pay any cash dividends 
our current credit agreement contains limitations on cash dividend payments as well as other restricted payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we own several noncontrolling equity interests in power projects in chile and italy

backlog and new orders new orders are recorded and added to the backlog of unfilled orders based on signed contracts as well as agreed letters of intent  which we have determined are legally binding and likely to proceed 
although backlog represents only business that is considered likely to be performed  cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur 
the elapsed time from the award of a contract to completion of performance may be up to approximately four years 
the dollar amount of backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future earnings related to the performance of such work due to factors outside our control  such as changes in project schedules  scope adjustments or project cancellations 
we cannot predict with certainty the portion of backlog to be performed in a given year 
backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations  deferrals  revised project scope and cost and sales of subsidiaries  if any 
backlog measured in foster wheeler scope reflects the dollar value of backlog excluding third party costs incurred by us on a reimbursable basis as agent or principal  which we refer to as flow through costs 
foster wheeler scope measures the component of backlog with profit potential and corresponds to our services plus fees for reimbursable contracts and total selling price for fixed price or lump sum contracts

although a majority of our revenues are realized under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to complete the projects in these future periods 
in addition  many of our projects are reimbursable at actual cost plus a fee  while some of the fixed price contracts provide for price adjustments through escalation clauses 
application of critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management and the audit committee of our board of directors approve the critical accounting policies 
highlighted below are the accounting policies that we consider significant to the understanding and operations of our business as well as key estimates that are used in implementing the policies 
revenue recognition revenues and profits on long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
progress towards completion on fixed price contracts is measured based on physical completion of individual tasks for all contracts with a value of  or greater 
for contracts with a value less than  progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs the cost to cost method 
progress towards completion on cost reimbursable contracts is measured based on the ratio of quantities expended to total forecasted quantities  typically man hours 
incentives are also recognized on a percentage of completion basis when the realization of an incentive is assessed as probable 
we include flow through costs consisting of materials  equipment or subcontractor services as both operating revenues and cost of operating revenues on cost reimbursable contracts when we have overall responsibility as the contractor for the engineering specifications and procurement or procurement services for such costs 
there is no contract profit impact of flow through costs as they are included in both operating revenues and cost of operating revenues 
contracts in process are stated at cost  increased for profits recorded on the completed effort or decreased for estimated losses  less billings to the customer and progress payments on uncompleted contracts 
at any point  we have numerous contracts in progress  all of which are at various stages of completion 
accounting for revenues and profits on long term contracts requires estimates of total estimated contract costs and estimates of progress toward completion to determine the extent of revenue and profit recognition 
we rely extensively on estimates to forecast quantities of labor man hours  materials and equipment  the costs for those quantities including exchange rates  and the schedule to execute the scope of work including allowances for weather  labor and civil unrest 
many of these estimates cannot be based on historical data  as most contracts are unique  specifically designed facilities 
in determining the revenues  we must estimate the percentage of completion  the likelihood that the client will pay for the work performed  and the cash to be received net of any taxes ultimately due or withheld in the country where the work is performed 
projects are reviewed on an individual basis and the estimates used are tailored to the specific circumstances 
in establishing these estimates  we exercise significant judgment  and all possible risks cannot be specifically quantified 

table of contents the percentage of completion method requires that adjustments or re evaluations to estimated project revenues and costs  including estimated claim recoveries  be recognized on a project to date cumulative basis  as changes to the estimates are identified 
revisions to project estimates are made as additional information becomes known  including information that becomes available subsequent to the date of the consolidated financial statements up through the date such consolidated financial statements are filed with the sec 
if the final estimated profit to complete a long term contract indicates a loss  provision is made immediately for the total loss anticipated 
profits are accrued throughout the life of the project based on the percentage of completion 
the project life cycle  including project specific warranty commitments  can be up to approximately six years in duration 
the actual project results can be significantly different from the estimated results 
when adjustments are identified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate is recognized as a change in the profit on the contract in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
we review all of our material contracts on a monthly basis and revise our estimates as appropriate for developments such as earning project incentive bonuses  incurring or expecting to incur contractual liquidated damages for performance or schedule issues  providing services and purchasing third party materials and equipment at costs differing from those previously estimated and testing completed facilities  which  in turn  eliminates or confirms completion and warranty related costs 
project incentives are recognized when it is probable they will be earned 
project incentives are frequently tied to cost  schedule and or safety targets and  therefore  tend to be earned late in a project s life cycle 
changes in estimated final contract revenues and costs can either increase or decrease the final estimated contract profit 
in the period in which a change in estimate is recognized  the cumulative impact of that change is recorded based on progress achieved through the period of change 
there were  and separate projects that had final estimated contract profit revisions whose impact on contract profit exceeded  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the changes in final estimated contract profit resulted in a net increase of   and  to reported contract profit for fiscal years  and  respectively  relating to the revaluation of work performed on contracts in prior periods 
the changes in fiscal year included  for positive settlements on two projects in our global e c group  of which  was associated with the receipt of a payment on a long outstanding arbitration award 
the impact on contract profit is measured as of the beginning of each fiscal year and represents the incremental contract profit or loss that would have been recorded in prior periods had we been able to recognize in those periods the impact of the current period changes in final estimated profits 
asbestos some of our us and us subsidiaries are defendants in numerous asbestos related lawsuits and out of court informal claims pending in the united states and the united kingdom 
plaintiffs claim damages for personal injury alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with work allegedly performed by our subsidiaries during the s and earlier 
the calculation of asbestos related liabilities and assets involves the use of estimates as discussed below 
we believe the most critical assumptions within our asbestos liability estimate are the number of future mesothelioma claims to be filed against us  the number of mesothelioma claims that ultimately will require payment from us or our insurers  and the indemnity payments required to resolve those mesothelioma claims 
united states as of december   we had recorded total liabilities of  comprised of an estimated liability of  relating to open outstanding claims being valued and an estimated liability of  relating to future unasserted claims through fiscal year of the total   is recorded in accrued expenses and  is recorded in asbestos related liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
since year end  we have worked with analysis research planning corporation  or arpc  nationally recognized consultants in the united states with respect to projecting asbestos liabilities  to estimate the amount of asbestos related indemnity and defense costs at year end for the next years 
based on its review 
table of contents of fiscal year activity  arpc recommended that the assumptions used to estimate our future asbestos liability be updated as of fiscal year end accordingly  we developed a revised estimate of our aggregate indemnity and defense costs through fiscal year considering the advice of arpc 
in fiscal year  we revalued our liability for asbestos indemnity and defense costs through fiscal year to  which brought our liability to a level consistent with arpc s reasonable best estimate 
in connection with updating our estimated asbestos liability and related asset  we recorded a charge of  in fiscal year resulting primarily from increased asbestos defense costs projected through fiscal year our liability estimate is based upon the following information and or assumptions number of open claims  forecasted number of future claims  estimated average cost per claim by disease type mesothelioma  lung cancer  and non malignancies and the breakdown of known and future claims into disease type mesothelioma  lung cancer or non malignancies 
the total estimated liability  which has not been discounted for the time value of money  includes both the estimate of forecasted indemnity amounts and forecasted defense costs 
total defense costs and indemnity liability payments are estimated to be incurred through fiscal year  during which period the incidence of new claims is forecasted to decrease each year 
we believe that it is likely that there will be new claims filed after fiscal year  but in light of uncertainties inherent in long term forecasts  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate the indemnity and defense costs that might be incurred after fiscal year historically  defense costs have represented approximately of total defense and indemnity costs 
through december   cumulative indemnity costs paid  prior to insurance recoveries  were approximately  and total defense costs paid were approximately  as of december   we had recorded assets of  which represents our best estimate of actual and probable insurance recoveries relating to our liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims through fiscal year   of this asset is recorded within accounts and notes receivable other  and  is recorded as asbestos related insurance recovery receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
the asbestos related asset recorded within accounts and notes receivable other as of december  reflects amounts due in the next months under executed settlement agreements with insurers and includes an estimate for a future settlement 
the recorded asbestos related insurance recovery receivable includes an estimate of recoveries from insurers in the unsettled insurance coverage litigation referred to below based upon the application of new jersey law to certain insurance coverage issues and assumptions relating to cost allocation and other factors as well as an estimate of the amount of recoveries under existing settlements with other insurers 
such amounts have not been discounted for the time value of money 
since fiscal year end  we have worked with peterson risk consulting llc  nationally recognized experts in the united states with respect to the estimation of insurance recoveries  to review our estimate of the value of the settled insurance asset and assist in the estimation of our unsettled asbestos insurance asset 
based on insurance policy data  historical claim data  future liability estimates including the expected timing of payments and allocation methodology assumptions we provided them  peterson risk consulting llc provided an analysis of the unsettled insurance asset as of december  we utilized that analysis to determine our estimate of the value of the unsettled insurance asset as of december  as of december   we estimated the value of our unsettled asbestos insurance asset related to ongoing litigation in new york state court with our subsidiaries insurers at  the litigation relates to the amounts of insurance coverage available for asbestos related claims and the proper allocation of the coverage among our subsidiaries various insurers and our subsidiaries as self insurers 
we believe that any amounts that our subsidiaries might be allocated as self insurer would be immaterial 
an adverse outcome in the pending insurance litigation described above could limit our remaining insurance recoveries and result in a reduction in our insurance asset 
however  a favorable outcome in all or part of the litigation could increase remaining insurance recoveries above our current estimate 
if we prevail in whole or in part in the litigation  we will revalue our asset relating to remaining available insurance recoveries based on the asbestos liability estimated at that time 
we have considered the asbestos litigation and the financial viability and legal obligations of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and believe that the insurers or their guarantors will continue to reimburse a significant portion of claims and defense costs relating to asbestos litigation 
we write off receivables from 
table of contents insurers that have become insolvent  there have been no such write offs during fiscal years  and the overall historic average combined indemnity and defense cost per resolved claim through december  has been approximately the average cost per resolved claim is increasing and we believe it will continue to increase in the future 
we plan to update our forecasts periodically to take into consideration our experience and other considerations to update our estimate of future costs and expected insurance recoveries 
the estimate of the liabilities and assets related to asbestos claims and recoveries is subject to a number of uncertainties that may result in significant changes in the current estimates 
among these are uncertainties as to the ultimate number and type of claims filed  the amounts of claim costs  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies with asbestos claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  as well as potential legislative changes 
increases in the number of claims filed or costs to resolve those claims could cause us to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the fiscal year consolidated financial statements associated with a change in certain estimates used in relation to the us asbestos related liabilities 
approximate change changes increase or decrease in assumption in liability one percentage point change in the inflation rate related to the indemnity and defense costs twenty five percent change in average indemnity settlement amount twenty five percent change in forecasted number of new claims based on the fiscal year end liability estimate  an increase of in the average per claim indemnity settlement amount would increase the liability by  as described above and the impact on expense would be dependent upon available additional insurance recoveries 
assuming no change to the assumptions currently used to estimate our insurance asset  this increase would result in a charge in the statement of operations in the range of approximately to of the increase in the liability 
long term cash flows would ultimately change by the same amount 
should there be an increase in the estimated liability in excess of this  the percentage of that increase that would be expected to be funded by additional insurance recoveries would decline 
our subsidiaries have been effective in managing the asbestos litigation  in part  because our subsidiaries have access to historical project documents and other business records going back more than years  allowing them to defend themselves by determining if the claimants were present at the location of the alleged asbestos exposure and  if so  the timing and extent of their presence  maintain good records on insurance policies and have identified and validated policies issued since  and have consistently and vigorously defended these claims which has resulted in dismissal of claims that are without merit or settlement of meritorious claims at amounts that are considered reasonable 
united kingdom as of december   we had recorded total liabilities of  comprised of an estimated liability relating to open outstanding claims of  and an estimated liability relating to future unasserted claims through fiscal year of  of the total   was recorded in accrued expenses and  was recorded in asbestos related liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
an asset in an equal amount was recorded for the expected uk asbestos related insurance recoveries  of which  was recorded in accounts and notes receivable other and  was recorded as asbestos related insurance recovery receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
the liability estimates are based on a uk house of lords judgment that pleural plaque claims do not amount to a compensable injury and accordingly  we have reduced our liability assessment 
if this ruling was reversed by legislation  the asbestos liability and related asset recorded in the uk would be approximately

the calculations of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  annual service cost and cash contributions required rely heavily on estimates about future events often extending decades into the future 
we are responsible for establishing the assumptions used for the estimates  which include the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of annual salary increases  the selection of the actuarial mortality tables  the annual healthcare cost trend rate only for the other postretirement benefit plans  and the annual inflation rate 
we utilize our business judgment in establishing the estimates used in the calculations of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  annual service cost and cash contributions 
these estimates are updated on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the estimates can vary significantly from the actual results and we cannot provide any assurance that the estimates used to calculate the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit liabilities included herein will approximate actual results 
the volatility between the assumptions and actual results can be significant

the discount rate is developed using a market based approach that matches our projected benefit payments to a spot yield curve of high quality corporate bonds 
changes in the discount rate from period to period were generally due to changes in long term interest rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is developed using a weighted average methodology  blending the expected returns on each class of investment in the plans portfolio 
the expected returns by asset class are developed considering both past performance and future considerations 
we annually review and adjust  as required  the long term rate of return for our pension plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets has ranged from to over the past three years

net actuarial losses reflect differences between expected and actual plan experience  including returns on plan assets  and changes in actuarial assumptions  all of which occurred over time 
these net actuarial losses  to the extent not offset by future actuarial gains  will result in increases in our future pension costs depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in which losses are not amortized

share based compensation plans our share based compensation plans include both restricted awards and stock option awards 
we measure these awards at fair value on their grant date and recognize compensation cost in the consolidated statements of operations over their vesting period 
compensation cost for our share based plans of   and  was charged against income for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we received   and  in cash from option exercises under our share based compensation plans for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of december   there was  and  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and restricted awards  respectively 
those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately months 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  which incorporates assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
we 
table of contents then recognize the fair value of each option as compensation cost ratably using the straight line attribution method over the service period generally the vesting period 
the black scholes model incorporates the following assumptions expected volatility we estimate the volatility of our share price at the date of grant using historical volatility adjusted for periods of unusual stock price activity 
expected term we estimate the expected term using the simplified method  as outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
risk free interest rate we estimate the risk free interest rate using the us treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant 
dividends we use an expected dividend yield of zero because we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since july and we do not have any plans to declare or pay any cash dividends 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant using a combination of historical data and demographic characteristics  and we revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fasb asc  in future periods  the compensation expense that we record for future awards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting the option pricing model assumptions used to estimate share based compensation expense 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair value  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair value of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair value of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair value originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair value originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is also a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and may materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our share based compensation plans 
goodwill and intangible assets at least annually  we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment 
we test for impairment at the reporting unit level as defined in fasb asc our reporting units are defined as the components one level below our operating segments  as these components constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
presently  goodwill exists in two of our reporting units one within our global power group business segment and one within our global e c group business segment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the 
table of contents impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  we evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit to assess recoverability  and impairments  if any  are recognized in earnings 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we determined that both the income and market valuation approaches provide inputs into the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units  which would be considered by market participants 
under the income valuation approach  we employed a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
this model requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future revenues  costs  margins  capital expenditures  changes in working capital  terminal year growth rate and cost of capital 
our cash flow models are based on our forecasted results for the applicable reporting units 
the models also assume a growth rate in the terminal year 
actual results could differ from our projections 
under the market valuation approach  we employed the guideline publicly traded company method  which indicates the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
after identifying and selecting guideline companies  we analyzed their business and financial profiles for relative similarity 
factors such as size  growth  risk and profitability were analyzed and compared to each of our reporting units 
we noted that the indicated fair value of each of the income approach and the market approach was above the carrying value of each reporting unit 
in april  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the offshore engineering division of ope holdings ltd 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded  of goodwill and  of identifiable intangible assets 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the houston operations of atlas engineering  inc in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded  of goodwill and  of identifiable intangible assets 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information related to these acquisitions 
goodwill of  and intangible assets of  relate to our global power group s european reporting unit which has experienced a number of performance related issues in prior years  however  the performance of this reporting unit has improved in recent years 
our calculation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was sufficiently in excess of its carrying value even after conducting various sensitivity analyses on key assumptions  such that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
however  should the performance of this unit deteriorate in the future  its carrying value could exceed its fair value in future periods  which could lead to an impairment of goodwill 
our calculation of the estimated fair value of our global e c group s reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value even after conducting various sensitivity analyses on key assumptions 
income taxes deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets within the various tax jurisdictions in which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
projecting future taxable income requires significant assumptions about future operating results  as well as the timing and character of taxable income in numerous jurisdictions 
for statutory purposes  the majority of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance is provided as of december  do not begin to expire until 
table of contents or later  based on the current tax laws 
we have a valuation allowance of  recorded as of december  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our subsidiaries file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions  including the united states  several us states and numerous non us jurisdictions around the world 
tax returns are also filed in jurisdictions where our subsidiaries execute project related work 
the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction 
because of the number of jurisdictions in which we file tax returns  in any given year the statute of limitations in a number of jurisdictions may expire within months from the balance sheet date 
as a result  we expect recurring changes in unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  none of which are expected to be individually significant 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us including federal  state and local or us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal year during fiscal year  we settled a tax audit in the asia pacific region which resulted in a  reduction of unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes 
a number of tax years are under audit by the relevant state and non us tax authorities 
we anticipate that several of these audits may be concluded in the foreseeable future  including in fiscal year based on the status of these audits  it is reasonably possible that the conclusion of the audits may result in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits 
however  it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of any such reduction at this time 
as of december   we had  of unrecognized tax benefits  of which  would  if recognized  affect our effective tax rate before existing valuation allowance considerations

accounting developments in june  authoritative guidance was issued which requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary or consolidator of a variable interest entity vie based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie  and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance changes the consideration of kick out rights  which are the ability to remove the enterprise with the power to direct the activities of a vie  in determining if an entity is a vie  which may cause certain additional entities to now be considered vies 
in contrast to prior authoritative guidance  the new guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and also amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that the guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands of dollars interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates should we need to borrow under our us senior credit agreement there were no such borrowings as of december  and  based on current operating plans and cash flow forecasts  none are expected in fiscal year and  to a limited extent  under our variable rate special purpose limited recourse project debt for any portion of the debt for which we have not entered into a fixed rate swap agreement 
if average market rates are basis points higher in the next twelve months  our interest expense for such period of time would increase  and our income before income taxes would decrease  by approximately this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings as of december  and does not reflect the impact of interest rate changes on outstanding debt held by certain of our equity interests since such debt is not consolidated on our balance sheet 
foreign currency risk we operate on a worldwide basis with substantial operations in europe that subject us to translation risk on the british pound  euro and polish zloty 
as part of our policies we do not hedge foreign currency translation exposure 
the activities of our operating subsidiaries are recorded in their respective functional currencies  which in most cases  is the local currency in the country of domicile of the subsidiary 
while this mitigates the potential impact of earnings fluctuations as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our affiliates do enter into transactions through the normal course of operations in currencies other than their functional currency 
we seek to minimize the resulting exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by attempting to match the currency of the revenues and expenses for our long term contracts 
we further mitigate these foreign currency exposures through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the exposed item  such as anticipated purchases or revenues  back to their functional currency 
we utilize all such financial instruments solely for hedging  and our company policy prohibits the speculative use of such instruments 
however  for financial reporting purposes  these contracts are generally not accounted for as hedges 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information 
if the counterparties to these contracts fail to perform under the settlement terms of the financial instruments  we could be subject to foreign currency exposure 
to minimize this risk  we enter into these financial instruments with financial institutions that are primarily rated bbb or better by standard poor s or the equivalent by other recognized credit rating agencies 

table of contents as of december   our primary foreign currency forward exchange contracts were as follows currency hedged foreign notional amount of notional amount of hedged currency exposure forward buy contracts forward sell contracts functional bought or sold in equivalent in equivalent in equivalent currency forward us dollars us dollars us dollars british pound euro   australian dollar    south african rand   us dollar    australian dollar british pound chilean peso us dollar chinese renminbi euro   us dollar    euro swedish kroner us dollar    polish zloty euro   south african rand british pound us dollar canadian dollar   euro british pound singapore dollar total    the notional amount provides one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of the balance sheet date 
amounts ultimately realized upon final settlement of these financial instruments  along with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures within our long term contracts  will depend on actual market exchange rates during the remaining life of the instruments 
the contracts mature between fiscal years and please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information on our primary foreign currency forward exchange contracts
