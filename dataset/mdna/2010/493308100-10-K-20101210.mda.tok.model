overview keynote is a leading global provider of internet and mobile cloud monitoring solutions 
we provide cloud based testing  monitoring and measurement products and services that enable our customers to know how their web sites  content  and applications perform on virtually any combination of actual browsers  networks and mobile devices 
since our founding in  we have built and optimized a global monitoring network comprised of over  measurement computers and mobile devices in over locations and metropolitan areas worldwide and execute more than million performance measurements every day 
we offer a robust portfolio of internet and mobile products and services to optimize the end user customer experience in two broad categories internet cloud internet cloud and mobile cloud mobile cloud 
we combine our internet and mobile cloud products and services with our real user experience testing to offer our customers a unique value proposition 
we deliver our products and services primarily through a cloud based model on a subscriptions basis formerly referred to as software as a service  or saas 
subscription fees range from monthly to multi year commitments and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of measurements  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements  the communication protocols or services measured and any additional features ordered 
our site systems  which include monitoring software and hardware  usually are offered via a software license fee model that is bundled with ongoing maintenance and support 
because we do not have sufficient objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance and support  the entire contract fee is amortized over the length of the contract and is included in ratable license revenue 
our real user experience testing services  or professional services  primarily are offered on an engagement  per incident or per study basis 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 
our net income decreased by million  from net income of million for the year ended september  to net income of million for the year ended september  total net revenue remained consistent  decreasing by million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the change in total net revenue is mainly attributable to a decrease of million in our ratable licenses revenue and a decrease of million in our professional services revenue  partially offset by  an increase of million in subscription services revenue 
total costs and expenses remained consistent  increasing million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  for the year ended september   our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total net revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our products and services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their contract at any time  with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 

table of contents we believe that important trends and challenges for our business include continuing to drive growth in our internet and mobile cloud products and services  as we believe that revenue growth is the primary factor in creating stockholder value  growing web measurement revenue such as transaction perspective and application perspective which have increased over the past three quarters in order to increase internet revenues  growing our overall customer base to support the growth of our internet and mobile revenue  continuing to control our expenses in fiscal to maintain and improve profitability  particularly because of the economic uncertainties that continue to exist  and challenges faced due to the current economic environment as this affects our customers ability to purchase our products and services

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  and long lived assets stock based compensation income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed reasonably assured 
one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash from that arrangement 

table of contents our revenue consists of subscription services revenue  ratable license revenue and professional services revenue 
subscription services revenue we enter into multiple element arrangements where sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the allocation of revenue 
as a result  the elements within our subscription arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for fees received under subscription arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement fee as revenue either ratably over the service period  generally twelve months  or based upon actual monthly usage 
for customers that are billed the entire amount of their subscription in advance  subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months  commencing on the day service is first provided 
for customers that are billed on a monthly basis  revenue is recognized monthly based upon actual service usage for the month 
regardless of when billing occurs  we recognize revenue as services are provided and defer any revenue that is unearned 
webeffective service is sold on a subscription basis or as part of a professional services engagement 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service that is sold on a subscription basis ratably over the subscription period  commencing on the first day service is provided  and such revenue is recorded as subscription services revenue 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service as part of a professional services engagement at the time the professional services revenue is recognized and such revenue is recorded as professional services revenue 
ratable licenses revenue ratable licenses revenue consists of fees from the sale of mobile automated test equipment  software  maintenance  engineering and consulting services associated with site systems 
we frequently enter into multiple element arrangements with mobile customers for the sale of our automated test equipment  including hardware and software licenses  consulting services to configure the hardware and software implementation or integration services  post contract support maintenance services  training services and other minor consulting services 
this determination is based on the hardware component of our multiple element arrangements being deemed to be a software related element 
in addition  customers do not purchase the hardware without also purchasing the software 
in other words  the software and hardware is sold as a package with payments due from customer upon delivery of this hardware and software package 
none of the site implementation integration services provided by us is considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed products 
this assessment is due to the implementation integration services being performed during a relatively short period generally within two to three months compared to the length of the arrangement which typically ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
additionally  the implementation integration services are general in nature and we have a history of successfully gaining customer acceptance 
we cannot allocate the arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value since sufficient vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
therefore  we recognize the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the maintenance period  historically ranging from twelve to thirty six months  once the implementation and integration services are completed  usually within two to three months following the delivery of the hardware and software 
where acceptance provisions exist in the arrangement the ratable recognition of revenue begins when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware has occurred as intended under the respective arrangement s contractual terms 
professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees generated from our professional consulting services that are purchased as part of a professional service or consulting project 
revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to twelve months 
for professional service projects that contain milestones  we recognize revenue once the services or milestones have been delivered  based on input measures 
payment occurs either up front or over time 

table of contents we also enter into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of either the combination of subscription and professional services or multiple professional services 
the company has been unable to establish objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements for such arrangements 
consequently  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the applicable performance period 
deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily unearned license and subscription services revenue  and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
deferred revenue is reduced to the extent that there are any accounts receivable balances associated with the deferred revenue unpaid deferred revenue at the balance sheet date and may change at any point in time based upon the timing of when invoices are collected 
short term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that has been collected in advance that will be earned within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
correspondingly  long term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that will be earned more than twelve months from the balance sheet date and primarily consists of site revenue 
we generally do not grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
free trials are occasionally provided to prospective customers who would like to try certain of our subscription services before they commit to purchasing the services 
the services provided during the trial period are typically stand alone transactions and are not bundled with other services 
revenue is not recognized for these free trial periods 
the table below provides the details of gross deferred revenue short term and long term aggregated  unpaid deferred revenue and net deferred revenue the amount presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and domestic international total in thousands net deferred revenue add back unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  net deferred revenue add back unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each outstanding invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review customers with invoices greater than days past due to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance 
billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions  collection rates  future recoveries and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additions to or reductions in allowances in the future 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

table of contents we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable from the results of operations of our single reporting segment 
in addition we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability of the intangible assets and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that our estimates or the related assumptions change  an impairment assessment is required and or an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
our annual goodwill review in each of fiscal   and did not result in an impairment charge 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was million as compared to million as of september  the change in goodwill from september  to september  was a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which affect the goodwill amounts recorded in our foreign subsidiaries 
stock based compensation we issue stock options and restricted stock units to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units or the issue of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail 
income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a period  our deferred tax expense increases 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
this analysis is applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and requires significant judgment and consideration of all available positive and negative evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
tax planning strategies may be implemented which would affect the tax rate 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 

table of contents the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors such as the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and the deferred tax assets are realized or a mismatch in the tax jurisdiction in which taxable income is generated and companies with the deferred tax assets 
as of october   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides direction on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
in december  we entered into an agreement whereby we purchased certain intangible assets from our german subsidiary 
this transaction was treated as an intercompany sale and  as such  tax is not recognized on the sale until we no longer benefit from the underlying asset 
therefore  during december  we recorded a long term prepaid tax asset of million which represents the tax that the german subsidiary will pay of million  offset by the elimination of the remaining carrying amount of the deferred tax liability related to these intangible assets that was established at the time of the acquisition of the german subsidiary 
the deferred tax liability had a carrying amount of million at the time of the transfer 
we are amortizing the net prepaid tax asset of million through tax expense over the life of the underlying asset which has been estimated to be months 
during the three months ended september   we recorded an additional prepaid tax asset of million which represents the additional tax that the german subsidiary will pay based upon an increase in the purchase price calculated in fiscal we are amortizing the additional net prepaid tax asset of million through tax expense over the remaining life of the underlying asset 
amortization expense on the prepaid tax asset was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
as of september   the prepaid tax asset  net of accumulated amortization  was million and is included in deferred costs and other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets

we have determined that the net operating losses and research and development credits acquired through the acquisition of two of our subsidiaries are subject to section limitations  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an additional ownership change occurs  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced 
if we were to make additional repurchases of shares of our common stock  we could face additional limits on our use of net operating losses 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense  which is included in total costs and expenses by category  was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease over the past two fiscal years is due to the full vesting of outstanding options  cancellation of options on termination of employees and the granting of fewer options over this time period 
stock based compensation expense during the year ended september  reflects an expense of million related to the cancellation in march of our chief executive officer s option to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  which was vested at the date of cancellation 
another option granted to our chief executive officer to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share was also cancelled in march no expense was recorded for this cancellation given that the option was fully vested at the date of the cancellation 

table of contents stock based compensation  in accordance with the fasb s guidance on accounting for stock based compensation related to employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as follows direct costs of ratable licenses direct costs of professional services development operations sales and marketing general and administrative total non gaap financial measures and other operational data we also consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share  adjusted ebitda  free cash flow and gross deferred revenues  and other operational data in managing and measuring the performance of our business 
the non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
however  we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
therefore  these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share non gaap net income is calculated by adjusting gaap net income loss for the provision for income taxes less cash taxes from on going operations  stock based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangibles 
non gaap net income per share is calculated by dividing non gaap net income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period

net deferred revenue is reduced to the extent that there are any accounts receivable balances associated with the deferred revenue unpaid deferred revenue at the balance sheet date and may change at any point in time based upon the timing of when invoices are collected 
gross deferred revenue is defined as the sum of net deferred revenue and unpaid deferred revenue

table of contents other operational data the following table provides certain other operational data that management uses to manage and measure our performance quarter ended september  worldwide customers approximately quarterly internet web measurement subscription net revenue in thousands average monthly internet pages measured average monthly revenue per internet page average monthly revenue per internet page is calculated as quarterly internet web measurement subscription net revenue months average monthly internet pages measured 
internet web measurement subscription net revenue consists of our application perspective  transaction perspective  and streaming perspective subscription services 
while the total number of customers has remained relatively constant for each of the periods ended september    and due to our sales and marketing efforts to replace lost customers with new customers  our total number of internet pages measured has increased due to the increased complexity of our customers web sites and their reliance on our measurements to monitor their web site performance 
however  at the same time  our average monthly revenue per internet page has decreased due to a decline in our average price per internet page measured as a result of the recent economic environment and other competitive pressures 
if we cannot increase or maintain our revenue per internet page measured  we will need to further increase our customer base to grow our subscription revenue 
as a result of the introduction of our flexuse system in fiscal  customers now have the ability to increase or decrease the number of pages they measure at any given time without significantly changing their overall spend 
the reason for this is they now have the flexibility to change not only the number of url targets they measure  but also the frequency and location of the measurements 
for example  internet pages measured and revenue per internet page over the last four quarters were significantly impacted by a single customer project that began about a year ago 
the pricing for this customer project was offered below our average pricing because this project was expected to transition shortly to keynote private agents which usually carry an unlimited usage pricing model 
if we were to exclude this single customer project s page count and revenues from our normally published metrics  the number of pages measured in the first fiscal quarter of would have been approximately  with revenue per page of  compared to approximately  pages in the fourth fiscal quarter of with revenue per page of with this adjustment  our internet pages measured would have grown by approximately  while the revenue per internet page would have decreased by approximately 
consequently  we believe that internet pages measured is no longer a reliable metric of underlying demand  and revenue per internet page is no longer a useful metric for understanding unit pricing trends 
as a result  commencing in our fiscal year we will not be publishing internet pages measured and revenue per internet page  as we do not believe these will be key business metrics 
however  we will continue to separately provide internet subscription revenue web measurement and internet subscription revenue other as measures of our internet business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources september  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments accounts receivable  net working capital days sales in accounts receivable dso dso for the fourth fiscal quarter is calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales for the three month period multiplied by number of days in the period the increase in dso from september  to september  was primarily due to granting foreign and domestic customers longer payment terms during contract negotiations 
the collectability of accounts receivable has not been affected 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  for a total of million 
cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  money market funds and fixed term deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of fixed term deposits with original maturities longer than three months and investment grade corporate and government debt securities with moody s ratings of a or better 
as of september   million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was held in the united states 
the remainder of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries 
if these foreign cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
cash flows from operating activities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers 
payments from subscription services customers are generally collected either at the beginning of the subscription period  ranging from one to twelve months  or monthly during the life of the subscription period 
payments for our ratable licenses are generally collected at delivery of the site system 
payments from some of our professional services customers are collected at the completion of the service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of cash from operating activities  are for personnel related expenditures  measurement and data collection infrastructure costs  insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses associated with operating our business 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash provided was mainly due to net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash adjustments consist primarily of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expenses  amortization of debt instruments  and deferred tax benefit 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 

table of contents for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash provided was mainly due to net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash adjustments consist primarily of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expenses and bad debt and billing adjustment reserves 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in prepaid and other assets  including prepaid tax assets  of million  partially offset by a decrease in account receivable of million 
the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses during the year ended september  was mainly attributed to a million cash payment to the german tax authority for taxes associated with fiscal year operations and the migration of intellectual property from germany to the united states 
cash flows from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relates to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments 
we also use cash to purchase property  equipment and software to support our growth and infrastructure and to make tenant improvements associated with space we lease in our headquarters building 
for the year ended september   net cash used by our investing activities was million 
we paid million for the purchase of short term investments  and received million from maturities and sales of short term investments 
we also purchased million of property  equipment  and software 
for the year ended september   net cash used by our investing activities was million 
we paid million for the purchase of short term investments  and received million from maturities and sales of short term investments 
we also purchased million of property  equipment  and software 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments made for stock repurchases and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended september   net cash from financing activities was million 
we received million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by common stock dividends of million 
for the year ended september   net cash from financing activities was million 
we received million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayment of notes payable of million 
commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of million in real property and equipment operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through october additionally  we had million of contingent commitments  with a remaining term of between one to twenty three months  to bandwidth and co location providers  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in equipment and other assets to support our growth 

table of contents the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  payment due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases contingent commitments bandwidth and co location total the above amounts exclude liabilities under the fasb s guidance on accounting for income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 
as of september   we have outstanding guarantees totaling million to customers and vendors of one of our foreign subsidiaries 
these guarantees can only be executed upon agreement by both the customer or vendor and us 
at september   these guarantees were secured by a million unsecured line of credit 
we generally do not indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing services against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that could subject us to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  cash dividends  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  our existing cash  short term investments and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business may be harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued new guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include hardware and software elements and that include multiple deliverables 
the guidance removed from the scope of industry specific revenue guidance for software and software related transactions  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
additionally  the new guidance provides updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and eliminates the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 
table of contents june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
at this time  we believe that the guidance will primarily affect the timing of recognizing revenue on our sales of site systems 
while we are still assessing the impact of this guidance on our accounting and reporting systems and processes  we have elected to adopt this guidance on a prospective basis and  at this time  do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial condition or operating results in the first fiscal quarter of during the first quarter of  we adopted the fasb s new guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures for all financial assets and liabilities 
the new guidance defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements 
adoption of the new fair value guidance for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  did not have a material effect on our financial condition or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance for business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination 
this new guidance also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured  as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
in april  the fasb amended this new guidance to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value  if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
we adopted the new guidance for acquisitions completed after october   the beginning of our fiscal year the impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of the business combinations completed after the adoption of this guidance 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance for accounting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the guidance also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of  which did not have an effect on our financial condition or operating results 
in march  the fasb issued new guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which enhances financial disclosure by requiring that objectives for using derivative instruments be described in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation in the form of tabular presentation  requiring transparency with respect to the entity s liquidity from using derivatives  and cross referencing an entity s derivative information within its financial footnotes 
we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of  which did not have an effect on our financial condition or operating results 
in april  the fasb issued new guidance for determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of the statement is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of  which did not have an effect on our financial condition or operating results 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
in february  the fasb issued an amendment to this guidance that removed the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance  as amended  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we have not and currently do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  particularly because most of our short term investments are invested in debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from their current levels  the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by million on an annualized basis 
foreign currency fluctuations we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
a majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in united states dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
as a result  our united states dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and the british pound  totaled million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we currently do not hedge or enter into currency exchange contracts against foreign currency exposures
