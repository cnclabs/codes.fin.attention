item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook summary we delivered sound financial results in despite significant market instability and uncertainty 
our business balance and geographic diversity enabled us to mitigate the impact of the volatile conditions and difficult market forces that we faced 
guided by our long term strategy  we continued to invest for future growth during this industry down cycle and to position ourselves for stronger performance in the years ahead 
in we captured a lead position in the us barge drilling market  expanded the geographic presence of our rental tools operations and moved forward on our projects to begin drilling operations in alaska 
we entered in sound financial condition with sufficient resources to provide for the needs of our current operations and to fund our growth initiatives 
overview parker drilling s revenues for the fourth quarter declined to million  or by percent  from fourth quarter revenues of million 
the company s fourth quarter gross margin declined to million  or by percent  from fourth quarter gross margin of million  while gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to percent in the fourth quarter from percent in the fourth quarter 
international drilling revenues declined percent  to million for the fourth quarter from million for the fourth quarter  and gross margin declined percent  to million for the fourth quarter from million in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the segment s gross margin as a percent of revenues declined to percent from percent 
the revenue decline reflects a lower average fleet utilization  modestly higher average dayrates and the impact of rig  our caspian sea barge rig  being in the shipyard for a scheduled overhaul and upgrade during the latter part of the fourth quarter 
these effects were matched by lower operating costs throughout the segment 
average fleet utilization for the fourth quarter was percent  compared with percent for the fourth quarter 
for the fourth quarter  the ten rig americas regional fleet operated at percent utilization  the twelve rig cis ame regional fleet operated at percent utilization and the eight rig asia pacific regional fleet operated at percent utilization 
rig was retired at the end of  reducing the company s international fleet to rigs and the cis ame regional fleet to eleven rigs 
us drilling revenues declined by percent to million for the fourth quarter from million for the fourth quarter  while gross margin declined percent  to million from million 
the decline in revenues and gross margin are due to a sharp drop in rig activity and reduced average dayrates 
the operation produced a better than breakeven gross margin despite the significant downturn in industry demand 
average fleet utilization for the fourth quarter of was percent  compared with percent for the fourth quarter of the company s barge fleet dayrates averaged  for the fourth quarter of  compared with  for the 
table of contents fourth quarter of at december   our gom barge rig fleet was reduced to rigs with the retirements of workover barge rigs b and b 
revenues for rental tools declined by percent  to million for the fourth quarter from million for the fourth quarter  and the segment s gross margin declined percent to million from million 
these reductions were primarily due to the decline in us land and gom shelf drilling activity and the impact of price discounting 
this was partially offset by increased demand for workover equipment  growing coverage in the us shale drilling areas and additional offshore deep drilling and international placements 
project management and engineering services revenues declined percent  to million for the fourth quarter from million for the fourth quarter  and gross margin declined percent to million from million 
the prior year s fourth quarter included revenues associated with the relocation and upgrade of the yastreb rig for enl on sakhalin island and operational revenues for enl s orlan platform which has since moved to a warm stack rate with reduced crew levels 
construction contract revenue increased to million from million while gross margin increased million to million from million  representing progress made on the bp liberty epci project 
capital expenditures for the three month and twelve month periods ended december  totaled million and respectively 
major spending projects in including million for the construction of parker drilling s two new build arctic land rigs for alaska and million for tubular goods and other rental equipment 
outlook the steep market declines of late and early in certain of our markets have moderated and there are signs in some areas that improvements are underway 
the utilization rate for the gom barge drilling fleet has improved  though dayrates remain low 
the domestic land rig count has recovered significantly  particularly in the shale plays where rental tool usage is more prevalent  leading to growing demand for rental tools and a lessening of price discounts 
the number of international rig tenders has grown  yet commitments are slow to develop and pressure on dayrates remain 
our project engineering and project management opportunities are growing  indicating an expanded field for our unique capabilities and offering the prospect of significant future growth from this business segment though we are encouraged by the recent direction of activity in some of our markets  we remain cautious about the immediacy of a broad upturn and the near term impact on our financial performance 
we believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable growth as the markets improve 
accordingly  we will continue to focus on cost management within our operations  improvements in delivering efficient performance to our customers and maintaining a safe environment for our employees 
we expect our international drilling business will continue to feel the effects of the downturn in e p spending in our primary markets  including continued pressure on dayrates and gaps in the work schedule of certain rigs coming off contract during in addition  rig  our caspian sea barge rig  will be on a reduced dayrate during its overhaul and upgrade period  which will continue into the second quarter 
our us drilling business has experienced improved market conditions of late 
further improvement driven by higher natural gas prices or an increase in deep gas programs  may provide some upward momentum to the revenues and earnings of this business 
the rental tools business should benefit from its expanded international and offshore placements and rising demand in us drilling  particularly the increases in the shale plays 
a further reduction in price discounting could enhance results 
based on our current project activity  we expect the higher revenues and earnings in for our project management business 
the addition of the o m for the bp owned liberty project is expected to account for much of this change 
we are currently bidding on several projects that  should we be successful  could add to our backlog and revenue later this year 

table of contents the revenues and earnings for the construction contract segment will phase out as the bp liberty project transitions from epci to o m  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of this project is expected to generate some revenue but relatively little earnings during that time 
capital expenditures  funded primarily through operating cash flows and use of revolving credit facilities  for are projected to be approximately to million comprised of approximately to million for maintenance projects  including rental tool investments 
major project spending includes approximately million to complete construction and delivery of the two parker drilling owned drill rigs for alaska and approximately million for the overhaul and upgrade of rig  our arctic class barge drilling rig operating in the caspian sea 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  operating gross margin was million for the year ended december   which consists of decreases in us drilling and rental tools of million offset by increases in international drilling operations  project management and engineering services and construction contract of million and a million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the year ended december  the following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues international drilling us drilling rental tools project management and engineering services construction contract total revenues operating gross margin international drilling gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization us drilling gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization rental tools gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization project management and engineering services gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization construction contract gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization total operating gross margin general and administrative expense impairment of goodwill provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets gain on disposition of assets  net total operating income

the gross margin amounts  excluding depreciation and amortization  and gross margin percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including gross margin 
management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more accurately reflects cash generated by segment

international drilling segment international drilling segment revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared with december  revenues in the cis ame region decreased by million primarily attributable to a reduction in operating days for rigs operating on land in kazakhstan and minimal drilling operations in turkmenistan 
these reductions in revenue were partially offset by increases in drilling revenue from operations in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan  caspian sea barge rig and algeria  which increased by million  million and million  respectively 
in our americas region  revenues decreased million due to lower revenues of million in mexico  due to contract completion on rig b and lower average dayrates  offset by increased revenues of million in colombia  a result of higher utilization 
in our asia pacific region  revenues decreased million due mainly to lower utilization in papua new guinea  indonesia and new zealand  whose revenues decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
the international drilling segment operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to increases in operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization in the cis ame region and colombia of million and million  respectively 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in mexico of million 
the increase in the cis ame region is attributable to an overall increase in average dayrates and a decrease in operating expenses for reduced labor costs and fewer rigs in operation 
the increase in colombia is attributable to increased operating days 
in algeria  revenues increased due to decreased downtime and operating expenses were lower due to a reduction in labor related costs 
the decrease in mexico is attributable to reduced operating days as a result of the completion of the contract for rig b 

table of contents us drilling segment revenues from the us drilling segment decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the revenue reduction was primarily attributable to the decline in industry wide barge drilling 
as a result  we experienced a million decrease for our barge drilling operations as average dayrates fell approximately  per day  further decreased by million as a result of utilization decreasing from percent to percent in and million in other decreases for reimbursable revenues 
as a result of the above mentioned factors  gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of rental tools segment revenues from the rental tools segment decreased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was due to greater discounting and lower utilization that was partially offset by decreased operating costs related to lower labor costs 
the rental tools segment gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million to million for as compared with project management and engineering services segment revenues for this segment decreased million during as compared with this slight decrease was attributable to lower revenues of million in orlan  where we were on a warm stack  or reduced stand by rate most of the year  million in kuwait due to lower reimbursable revenues  and the completion of the contract in china in these decreases were offset by higher revenues for our operations on the yastreb rig in sakhalin island million and engineering services million primarily related to our arkutun dagi project 
for sakhalin operations  million was due to higher dayrates and million due to reimbursable expenses on which we earn a fixed fee during the rig move  upgrade and customer modification phase of the contract 
project management and engineering services do not incur depreciation and amortization  and as such  gross margin for this segment increased million in as compared to primarily due to the arkutun dagi project 
construction contract segment revenues from the construction contract segment increased million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues from the construction of the extended reach drilling rig for use in the alaskan beaufort sea were million for compared with million in this project is a cost plus fixed fee contract 
gross margin for the epci project is based on the percentage of completion of the contract in which costs to date compared to projected total costs are used to determine the percentage of completion utilizing the cost to cost method 
gross margin recognized during was million compared with million in other financial data gains on asset dispositions were million in  an increase of million as a result of various asset sales in as compared with million in the gain on asset dispositions in is primarily attributable to a million settlement with a tugboat company in regards to a barge rig that was overturned in while being transported to shore 
interest expense for was million  an increase of million as compared with interest income for decreased million as compared with general and administration expense for increased million as compared with the increased general and administrative costs are primarily related to higher legal and professional fees associated with the ongoing doj and sec investigations and our work product related to various matters further discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these fees included improvements to our overall compliance process  code of conduct and other matters arising as a result of our internal investigation and responses to the sec and doj inquiries

international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in revenues in mexico  algeria and turkmenistan increased by million  million and million  respectively  as there were minimal drilling operations in these countries during the increase in mexico was partially attributable to dayrate increases for our barge rig operating in mexico 
revenues in the cis region increased by million primarily due to a million increase in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan as a result of the addition of rigs and to existing operations of rigs and  an increase in the dayrate for our barge rig operating in the caspian sea and the above mentioned turkmenistan revenues 
these increases were partially offset by an increase of million in revenues in colombia as compared with  due to lower utilization of our two rigs in colombia in in our asia pacific region  revenues decreased million in due mainly to completion of our contract within bangladesh for rig in march million and percent lower utilization in papua new guinea million 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in new zealand due to increased dayrates and operating days and a million increase in our indonesia operations 
international operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million during compared with the year ended  due primarily to favorable increases in our operations in mexico million and the cis region million  offset by decreases in colombia million and our asia pacific region million 
the increase in mexico is attributable to five rigs operating the entire period in and two rigs commencing operations in february in as we were in the start up phase for these operations in the third quarter of in the cis region  the primary driver was the increased dayrates for our barge rig operating in the caspian sea  increased utilization in the karachaganak area of kazakhstan and operation of rig in turkmenistan were the main drivers of the increase 
in colombia  the completion of our contracts in late and late february were the cause of the decrease  although rig began a one year contract in mid may our asia pacific region decline of million was a result of rig in bangladesh not operating in as compared to and papua new guinea incurring lower utilization when compared to the same period of  with these declines being partially offset by increases in our new zealand and indonesia operations 

table of contents us drilling segment revenues for the u 
s drilling segment decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decreased revenues were primarily due to a million decrease for our barge drilling operations as average dayrates for our deep drilling barges fell approximately  per day

convertible senior notes as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to account for the retrospective application related to newly adopted accounting guidance in regards to accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the debt discount is accretive to interest expense over the life of the debt 
the million reclassified to additional paid in capital supported adjustments to interest expense  deferred income taxes and long term debt as discussed further in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes due july  the notes were issued at par and interest is payable semiannually on july th and january th 
the significant terms of the convertible notes are as follows notes conversion feature the initial conversion price for note holders to convert their notes into shares is at a common stock share price equivalent of shares of common stock per  note value 
conversion rate adjustments occur for any issuances of stock  warrants  rights or options except for stock purchase plans or dividend re investments or any other transfer of benefit to substantially all stockholders  or as a result of a tender or exchange offer 
the company may  under advice of our board of directors  increase the conversion rate at our sole discretion for a period of at least days 
notes settlement feature upon tender of the notes for conversion  the company can either settle entirely in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  solely at our option 
the company s intent is to satisfy our conversion obligation for our notes in cash  rather than in common stock  for at least the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
this reduced the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include any possible conversion premium  which would be the difference between the average price of our shares and the conversion price per share of common stock 
contingent conversion feature note holders may only convert notes when either sales price or trading price conditions are met  on or after the notes due date or upon certain accounting changes or certain corporate transactions fundamental changes involving stock distributions 
make whole provisions are only included in the accounting and fundamental change conversions such that holders do not lose value as a result of the changes 
settlement feature upon conversion  we will pay shares of our cash and common stock if any  based on a daily conversion rate multiplied by a volume weighted average price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date 
conversions can be settled in cash or shares  solely at our discretion 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the senior notes to convert had been met 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  the company purchased a convertible note hedge the note hedge and sold warrants in private transactions with counterparties that were different than the ultimate holders of the notes 
the note hedge included purchasing free standing call options and selling free standing warrants  both exercisable in the company s common shares 
the note hedge allows us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties to the transaction equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and or pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
the terms of the call options mirror the notes major terms whereby the call option strike price is the same as the initial conversion price as are the number of shares callable  per share and  shares respectively 
this feature prevents dilution of the company s outstanding shares 
the warrants allow the company to sell  common shares at a strike price of per share 
the conversion price of the notes remains at per share  and the existence of the call options and warrants serve to guard against dilution at share prices less than 
table of contents per share  since we would be able to satisfy our obligations and deliver shares upon conversion of the notes with shares that are obtained by exercising the call options 
we paid a premium of approximately million for the call options  and we received proceeds for a premium of approximately million for the sale of the warrants 
this reduced the net cost of the note hedge to million 
the expiration date of the note hedge is the earlier of the last day on which the notes remain outstanding and the maturity date of the notes 
the notes are classified as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
because we have the choice of settling the call options and the warrants in cash or shares of our common stock and these contracts meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification  the cost of the call options and proceeds from the sale of the warrants are classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  because both of these contracts are classified in stockholders equity and are solely indexed to our own common stock  they are not accounted for as derivatives 
debt issuance costs totaled approximately million and are being amortized over the five year term of the notes using the effective interest method 
proceeds from the transaction of million were used to redeem our outstanding senior floating rate notes the senior floating rate notes  to pay the net cost of hedge and warrant transactions  and for general corporate purposes 
on september   we redeemed million face value of our senior floating rate notes at the redemption price of percent 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our convertible senior notes was used to fund the redemption 
credit facility on september   we replaced our existing million credit agreement with a new million amended and restated credit agreement credit facility which would have expired in september the credit facility  which was replaced by the facility  was secured by rental tools equipment  accounts receivable and the stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries  other than domestic subsidiaries owned by a foreign subsidiary  and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as minimum ratios for consolidated leverage  consolidated interest coverage and consolidated senior secured leverage

the revolving credit facility expires may  we used derivative instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations in connection with our million senior floating rate notes which were fully redeemed on september  these derivative instruments  which consisted of variable to fixed interest rate swaps  did not meet the criteria for applying hedge accounting and were therefore not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recognized in earnings 
on july   we terminated one swap scheduled to expire on september   and received million 
on september   our one remaining swap expired 
other matters business risks internationally  we specialize in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and can involve harsh environmental conditions 
our international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies and integrated service providers in the exploration and development of reserves of oil and gas 
in the united states  we primarily drill in the transition zones of the gom for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is primarily dependent on the exploration and development activities of the companies that make up our customer base 
see item a  risk factors  for a discussion of risks related to our business 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net realizable value exceeds our net carrying value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value and when step one undiscounted cash flow analysis failed 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
as a result of certain impairment indicators  primarily the depressed market in the gom  we tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december  and determined that three of our rigs  two rigs in our us drilling segment and one in our international drilling segment  required reductions of million and million  respectively in their net book value to salvage value based upon the our evaluation of future marketability  future cash infusions to maintain the equipment and evaluation of current market conditions affecting overall utilization of equipment in the regions in which we currently participate 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability and health benefits claims 
these accruals use historical data 
table of contents based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our net operating loss nol carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and  in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we provide for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
on january   we adopted amendments to accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
this accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately anticipate actual outcome 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
construction contract revenues and costs are recognized on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the cost to cost method 
recent accounting pronouncements consolidation effective january   we adopted the accounting standards update related to noncontrolling interest that established accounting and reporting requirements for noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the update required that noncontrolling interest be reported as equity on the consolidated balance sheet and required that net income attributable to controlling interest and to 
table of contents noncontrolling interest be shown separately on the face of the statement of operations 
the update also changes accounting for losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 
our adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet  statements of operations or cash flows 
fair value measurements and disclosures effective january   we adopted the accounting standards update related to fair value measurement of financial instruments that defined fair value  thereby offering a single source of guidance for the application of fair value measurement  established a framework for measuring fair value that contains a three level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques  and required enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
our adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet  statements of operations or cash flows 
effective january   we adopted the remaining provisions of the accounting standards update for fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
our adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet  statements of operations or cash flows 
effective april   we adopted the accounting standards update related to measuring fair value when the volume and level of activity for the assets or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  which provided additional guidance for estimating fair value when there is no active market or where the activity represents distressed sales on an interim and annual reporting basis 
our adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet  statements of operations or cash flows 
subsequent events effective for events occurring subsequent to june   we adopted the accounting standards update regarding subsequent events  which established the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
our adoption did not have a material impact on the disclosures contained within our notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk our international operations expose us to foreign exchange risk 
there are a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign exchange risk  including customer contract payment terms and the possible use of foreign exchange derivative instruments 
our primary foreign exchange risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars  which is our functional currency  and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
due to various factors  including customer acceptance  local banking laws  other statutory requirements  local currency convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs  actual foreign exchange needs may vary from those anticipated in the customer contracts  resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in foreign currencies typically have not had a material impact on our overall results 
in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency requirements  foreign exchange derivative instruments  specifically foreign exchange forward contracts  or spot purchases  may be used to mitigate foreign currency risk 
a foreign exchange forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we had no open foreign exchange derivative contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently 
table of contents available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of senior notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible senior notes due was million on december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million for the senior notes and million for the convertible senior notes 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we reported the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million decrease in the fair value of the derivative positions 
on july   we terminated one swap scheduled to expire in september and received million 
the second swap was not renewed and expired on september
