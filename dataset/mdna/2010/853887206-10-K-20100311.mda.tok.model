references to   and refer to the week period ended january   and the week periods ended december   and december  overview the company we are a leading provider of business documents and related services 
we partner with our customers to manage  control  and source their document and print related spending 
we not only produce printed documents  but we also help companies migrate from paper based to digital processes by providing innovative tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
to accomplish this  we provide products and services including printed forms and documents  labels  workflow and software solutions  warehousing  and distribution 
we make a measurable difference for our customers by helping them achieve their desired business outcomes by assisting them with reducing costs  transitioning to more efficient processes  effectively managing their risks  meeting their regulatory and industry requirements  and driving their business growth 
our operations include four reportable segments based upon the primary markets we serve healthcare  financial services  emerging  and industrial 
our business challenges we are engaged in an industry undergoing fundamental changes 
technological advances have made electronic distribution of documents  internet hosting  digital printing  and print on demand valid  cost effective alternatives to traditional custom printed documents and customer communications 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
thus  we believe our company is facing the following key challenges transformation of our portfolio of products excess production capacity and price competition within our industry future pension funding requirements and amortization of actuarial gains and losses economic uncertainties 
the following is a discussion of these business challenges and our strategy for managing their effect on our business 
transformation of our portfolio of products traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many are being replaced or devalued with advances in digital technologies  causing steady declines in demand for a large portion of our current product line 
the same digital advances also introduce new opportunities with significant growth potential for us  such as print on demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
we currently have many innovative products  such as our healthcare wristbands  secure document solutions  and industrial in mold labeling  which address important business needs and are positioned for growth 
during the second half of  we began the process of evolving into a market focused innovator 
in  we transformed from a product driven company to one focused on the key markets we serve 
we aligned management roles and resources to create an intense focus on customer needs within our four primary markets 
we believe our extensive expertise within our markets combined with increased focus on targeted solutions for those markets will differentiate us from our competitors and produce growth opportunities outside of traditional printed documents 
transforming our product portfolio to continue to provide innovative  valuable solutions to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make substantial investments in new and existing technologies and to develop key strategic business relationships 
the myc initiative to continue our transformation  we launched an ongoing company wide review of business practices and growth acceleration opportunities in designed around the priorities of client satisfaction  cost reduction  and increased market coverage that we called myc the intent of myc is to simplify business  move closer to the customer  grow revenue  and improve overall efficiency of our business 
the myc initiative is being conducted with the assistance of a third party specializing in driving earnings growth through employee collaboration 
as a result of this intensive process  we plan to optimize our manufacturing footprint by investing in regional print on demand centers  scaling down local print on demand centers  closing certain production and distribution centers  improving our supply chain  and simplifying processes proactively address the movement to digital technologies and manage working capital more effectively by moving to on demand based production  lowering inventory and warehousing requirements reposition and refine our go to market organization to capture revenue growth in core markets invest in system enhancements making it easier to serve customers employ strategic procurement processes and systems that leverage vendor relationships company wide 
implementation of ideas generated through the myc initiative will continue through  with a majority of the plans to be executed in the next months 
when fully implemented  we expect to achieve annualized cost savings between and million through a combination of workforce reduction  strategic closure of production and distribution facilities  revenue generation  and other efficiency initiatives 
part of the myc savings will be used to help fund the investments required to transform our current product portfolio 
we are also currently negotiating a new credit facility and expect to be able to increase our borrowing availability  giving us access to additional capital  if needed  to support necessary investments 
in addition  we believe our strategic focus on and in depth expertise in our primary markets provides us a competitive advantage and will enable us to forge necessary business relationships to aid in expanding and transforming our product offerings 
excess production capacity and price competition within our industry paper mills have continued to manage production capacity through downtime and closures in order to maintain or increase paper prices 
in  we saw our material prices stabilize as depressed economic conditions dampened paper mill efforts to continue price increases 
however  we expect paper mills to continue managing paper prices  especially as the economy strengthens  and have seen indications that paper prices may even be increasing as early as the first quarter of despite a competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through increased paper costs  although it often takes several quarters due to the custom nature of our products and our contractual relationships with many of our customers 
we expect this trend to continue  however  weak economic conditions may limit our success at recovering all of our increased costs  potentially resulting in lower margins on products we sell 
additionally  poor economic conditions have increased price competition within our markets 
due to an already over supplied market  an increase in pricing concessions has resulted in order to remain competitive and maintain existing customer base 
to counteract these trends  we implemented restructuring actions in to reduce our annual operating costs 
we eliminated approximately positions throughout the company  integrated several print centers with distribution warehouses  selectively closed print centers and distribution warehouses  and redesigned our sales support infrastructure 
we also implemented other cost reduction initiatives targeting purchasing costs and other non compensation expenditures 
our success in these actions has enabled us to largely maintain our gross margin percentages despite substantial declines in revenue 
we are continuing to further refine our operations and cost structure through the myc process and the resulting restructuring actions initiated at the end of we expect the additional cost savings and operational efficiencies created as a result of these actions to allow us to maintain and improve our competitive positio n in the future 
future pension funding and loss amortization during   and most recently in  our qualified pension plan became underfunded due to weak stock market returns and historically low long term interest rates 
the amortization of these asset losses plus other actuarial losses has resulted in significant pension loss amortization in recent years equivalent to per share in  per share in  and per share in we expect this trend to continue and that pension loss amortization will continue to materially impact our operating profit in future years 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates over the next three years  we project pension loss amortization to be million in  million in  and million in however  due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty regarding the assumptions used to determine these amounts  actual results could differ significantly from those expected 
the pension protection act of became effective in and increases the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
based upon the new requirements and the recent decline in the value of our pension assets  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  with minimum funding requirements in and estimated to be million and million 
we anticipate making contributions in excess of the minimum in order to lower required minimum contributions in later years 
therefore  we are estimating that actual cash contributions will be million in and million in and currently  there is proposed legislation working through congress that may change the funding rules to provide funding relief  however  at this time we are unable to determine what effect this legislation may have on our required contributions or the likelihood of its passage 
our estimates of minimum funding requ irements are also dependent upon assumptions  such as investment returns and interest rates  having a high degree of variability and uncertainty  as evidenced in the recent economic climate 
unexpected gains or losses in asset values or changes in factors affecting interest rates could materially impact the actual required contributions 
in response to these challenges  in we modified our qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
as a result  participants in these plans ceased accruing additional pension benefits in july  and the final pension amounts were based upon pay and service through june  the company match in the k savings plan was increased for the affected employees 
the effect of these actions eliminated pension service costs for these plans for and beyond  resulting in annualized net savings of approximately million in retirement costs 
in addition  some variability in the actuarial gains and losses of these plans were eliminated as estimates of service periods and compensation levels are no longer required since plan benefits have essentially been frozen 
despite these changes  settlement of our pension obligations will still present uncertainty and variability in our financial results in future years  with the ultimate outcome determined by actual asset performance in our qualified plan  interest rates  and the level of our pension contributions 
economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions in and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in our revenue 
although we have seen slight improvements in some economic indicators within our markets  unemployment rates and other leading indicators such as housing starts continue to be strained 
a weak job market combined with constrained bank lending may continue to hamper substantial growth over the next year 
while we cannot predict the pace of the economic recovery  we believe consumer spending and the resulting increases in our customer s production levels may be slow to rebound 
these uncertainties create challenges to achieving revenue growth and increasing profitability in the short term 
as a result  we are highly focused on customer retention and expansion 
during  revenue declines were partially offset by increases in our customer base across all of our markets  as well as increased sales in some of our growth targeted products 
we attribute these improvements to our new market focused sales strategy and expect this trend to continue  although declines in revenue attributable to the weak economic conditions may continue to outpace these gains over the next year 
we also continue to evaluate our operations and costs and to implement necessary plans to achieve operational efficiencies and maintain our profit margins 
we have a proven history of achieving projected cost savings on our initiatives and expect this trend to continue 
our focus in  our focus was on increasing our client coverage and satisfaction  relentless pursuit of cost reduction  and generating positive cash flow 
as a result of aligning our organization around our key markets  solidifying our go to market strategy  and the myc process  we have made substantial progress in these areas 
building on this success  our priorities include the following organizational excellence client loyalty relentless pursuit of cost reduction intense governance for return on investment innovation organizational excellence our realignment in around vertical markets has enabled us to focus our efforts on providing valuable solutions to markets where we are trusted industry leaders and have extensive understanding of document related needs 
in  our goal is organizational excellence 
we will strive for organizational excellence by continuing to advance our market focus  building a strong marketing organization for each of our four operating segments  further refining our shared services capabilities  and optimizing our customer service centers 
client loyalty our intense focus on our customers needs is intended to foster customer loyalty  and we have developed processes and tools to assist in building loyalty  extending our relationships  and measuring and ensuring customer satisfaction 
we will also be sponsoring market focused customer symposiums during to further enhance our understanding of customer needs and how we can serve them 
relentless pursuit of cost reduction we will continue to critically evaluate costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive and most importantly  generate positive cash flow 
the myc process will be an integral part of continuing our goals in this area 
intense governance for return on investment we expect to continue to scrutinize capital expenditures to ensure alignment with corporate priorities and earnings improvement initiatives and have advanced the governance process over this key area 
we will also implement processes that promote periodic reviews of the success of cost initiatives  ensuring we continue to realize expected savings 
we expect these measures to allow us to weather the current economic challenges and position us for growth as the economy strengthens 
innovation one of the keys to our future success will be our ability to deliver innovative products and services that meet anticipated needs and solutions specific to our customers 
as a result  each business unit has been tasked with innovation objectives 
we plan to leverage our patented intellectual property and integrate our core technology and material science capabilities into new research and development opportunities 
we also plan to leverage third party insight to drive higher levels of performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available  and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below for the pension plan  fair value measurements  deferred taxes  inventories  and environmental liabilities generally do not affect segment results 
however  changes in revenue recognition and share based compensation expense through an allocation of corporate expenses could impact individual segment results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation and certain components of pension benefit costs is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long term investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and will continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our non qualified pension benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost 
we review the assumptions used to account for our pension obligations and benefit cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate used for pension obligations holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
net periodic pension benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets the discount rate was through march  and april through december due to settlements that occurred on march  as a result  pension expense was adjusted to reflect the updated discount rate at that time 
holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease pension cost by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase pension cost by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase pension benefit cost by million 
we currently have approximately million of actuarial losses related to our pension plans that will be amortized to expense in future years 
we previously expected that amortization expense would continue to trend lower in and thereafter 
however  as a result of the significant asset and liability losses in  we expect amortization expense to trend higher based on current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates 
due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty in these assumptions  actual results could differ significantly 
the long term rate of return on plan assets we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  the same as as a result of changes in interest rates as of the year end measurement date in  we expect to use a rate of to determine net periodic pension costs 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we are required to use valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach  income approach  and or cost approach 
inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
inputs may be observable  meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources  or unobservable  meaning those that reflect our own estimate about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabili ties and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy is as follows level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions that are not corroborated by market data goodwill during  we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill 
the test was performed at the reporting unit level using the two step approach required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the first step of the test required us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to that reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
to determine fair value  we considered the cost  market  and income approaches 
we determined that the cost method would not yield a representative value at which market participants would transact  so this method was not utilized 
we followed an income approach utilizing a discounted future cash flow analyses and a market based approach based on a multiple of ebitda 
our determination of the fair value of goodwill was based on the discounted future cash flow analysis since that resulted in the highest fair value 
as a result  we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than its carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
with the income approach  cash flows that are anticipated over several years  plus a terminal value at the end of that period  are discounted to their present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the most critical inputs used were the revenue and cost assumptions  the terminal value assumed  and the discount rate applied 
we determined that these inputs were unobservable level inputs  therefore  the reporting unit fair value measurement was deemed a level measurement 
the following describes the information used to develop the inputs used in our fair value calculations revenue and cost assumptions using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we projected revenue for the remainder of through we then applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flow through a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream based on the year five cash flow 
we calculated three outcomes a most likely  a best case  and a worst case based on future cash flow projections 
all outcomes were weighted to arrive at an overall projected cash flow 
discount rate determination we used a weighted average cost of capital that assumed a mix of debt and equity consistent with our current financing structure and investor lender expectations 
in addition to calculating a range of possible outcomes  we also performed a sensitivity analysis designed to understand the relative impact of the major assumptions used in our calculations 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or there was a variation in either the terminal value or the discount rate  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans  tax planning strategies  and other expectations about future outcomes 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
we review the potential future tax benefits of all deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
our review includes consideration of historical and projected future operating results  reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the eligible carryforward period of each deferred tax asset to determine whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
included in deferred tax assets at january  are unused us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million million in deferred tax assets  generally expiring from through based on the weight of available evidence  including the potential sources of taxable income  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these losses will be utilized 
as such  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for the tax benefit of these losses 
we have established valuation allowances for us and canadian capital loss carryforwards of approximately million million in deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized before the expiration period 
should future taxable income be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
inventories under the dollar value lifo method  similar items of inventory are aggregated to form inventory pools 
increases and decreases in a pool are identified and measured in terms of the total dollar value of inventory in the pool 
the use of indices is an integral part of the dollar value lifo method 
using the link chain technique  a cumulative index is used to convert deflate year end inventories priced at current cost to base year cost and to convert inflate an increment stated at base year cost back to lifo cost 
under both techniques  indices are developed by pricing all inventory items twice 
in other words  inventory quantities on hand at the end of the current year are priced at current year current costs and at prior year current costs 
this ratio of costs is then used to adjust the cumulative index at the end of the preceding year to a new cumulative index 
the total current cost of current year end in ventories is next converted to total base year cost by means of the new cumulative index 
the net change in inventory is then determined by comparing the total inventory at base year cost at the beginning and the end of the current year 
lifo values are determined  by layer  by applying the applicable cumulative index to the increments stated at base year cost 
we evaluate the lifo calculation each quarter and record an adjustment  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our inventories and product mix and our merchandise mix 
we believe the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics producer price indices or other published indices 
should actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances at the end of any fiscal year differ materially from our interim estimates  changes could occur that would materially affect our consolidated statement of income for that year 
at january   a increase in our cumulative index percentage would have increased our lifo expense approximately million or approximately million after tax 
conversely  a decrease in our cumulative index percentage would have decreased our lifo expense by approximately million or approximately million after tax 
environmental remediation we are currently involved in the remediation of three environmental sites  one of which is new this year 
in accordance with accounting standards for environmental liabilities  we have recorded an estimate of the total costs to remediate these sites 
however  due to the lengthy nature in settling environmental obligations and the fact that final remedies have not been determined for two of the sites  determining total costs requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
areas requiring the most significant judgments and estimates include the extent and timing of remediation actions and the determination of our share of the final remedy 
due to the complexity of environmental issues  monitoring costs can extend for many years 
we must also estimate all costs related to the final remedy  which frequently involves complex procedures that can vary significantly from original plans depending on actual conditions encountered on the site 
as a result  actual costs incurred to remediate these sites could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as software  professional services  and ongoing maintenance and post contract customer support 
we account for the licensing of software arrangements in accordance with general accepted accounting standards for software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are e ssential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements business combinations and noncontrolling interests as a result of newly issued accounting standards  in fiscal we changed our financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling or minority interests in our consolidated financial statements 
we now recognize  with certain exceptions  all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a percent controlling interest at their acquisition date fair value  recognize contingent consideration at the acquisition date fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings  recognize preacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values  capitalize in process research and development acquired at fair value  expense  as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs  generally expense acquisition related restructuring costs  and recognize changes in existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 
we also now record a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as a separate component of equity 
gains or losses are not recognized on sales  they are recorded as increases or decreases to paid in capital  unless there is a loss of control 
we have not entered into any business combination transactions during  and therefore  the effect of implementing these standards will be dependent upon the nature and extent of future business combination transactions 
earnings per share in fiscal  we adopted a new accounting standard for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under the guidance  unvested share based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
although we do have unvested share based awards that are considered participating securities  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the computation of earnings per share 
fair value as permitted  we deferred adoption of fair value accounting standards until fiscal for nonfinancial assets and liabilities not currently recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  including goodwill  trademark intangible assets  and property and equipment that are reported at fair value as a result of impairment testing 
subsequent events effective for the quarterly period ended june   we adopted a newly issued accounting standard for reporting subsequent events 
the new standard provides guidance for the accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
it also requires us to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  accounting standards update asu no 
was released amending the revenue recognition standards related to non software multiple element revenue arrangements 
the update eliminates the separation criterion that requires entities to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements  establishes a selling price hierarchy to help entities allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of account  eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price allocation method for all arrangements  and significantly expands required disclosures related to multiple element arrangements 
the update is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating this update to determine its effect upon our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
also in october  asu no 
was issued 
this update amends the scope of software revenue recognition standards to exclude tangible products that contain software elements and non software elements that function together to interdependently deliver the product s essential functionality 
the update is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  while we enter into arrangements that are subject to software revenue recognition standards  we do not expect adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for   and segment operating results an analysis of revenue  cost of sales  gross margin  and operating income by segment 
consolidated summary the following summarizes our consolidated results for   and change change revenue cost of sales gross margin gross margin of sales sg a expense pension curtailments and settlements restructuring and asset impairment environmental remediation other expense  net loss income from continuing operations before taxes income tax benefit expense rate loss income from continuing operations revenue in and  the company s revenue was under pressure from several aspects 
volatile economic conditions  especially throughout  led to weaker pricing in an already over supplied and competitive industry as our customers were forced to seek cost savings in their own operations to remain viable 
adoption of digital technologies also continued to erode revenues from traditional print as expected within the industry  but did so at an accelerated rate as customers transitioned to available digital technologies as a means to further reduce costs 
additionally  a portion of our revenues are derived from industrial manufacturing customers who were particularly affected by the downturn in the economy 
the declining consumer demand in this market in and translated to lower unit sales as manufacturing customers reduced their production in response 
as a result of these factors  revenue declined million or in and million or in in  lower units accounted for a decline of approximately million or in consolidated revenues 
the unit decline was lessened by the extra week in our fiscal year that contributed approximately million and by higher revenue from new customer contracts 
because of our intense customer focus  we have been able to extend our services or increase our customer base across all of our segments and have substantially maintained our existing customer base during the year 
pricing increased for the pass through of our material costs at a lower rate in  as our material prices stabilized during the year 
combined with increased levels of pricing concessions  overall pricing in declined 
in  lower unit sales accounted for a decline of approximately while pricing accounted for a slight increase of  primarily reflecting the pass through of increased paper and fuel costs 
we estimate that economic factors accounted for the majority of the unit decline 
current economic conditions continue to be weak  although we have seen some signs of economic recovery 
within the manufacturing environment  we have seen some customers reduce the frequency and duration of temporary plant shut downs and a slight increase in order levels in the last quarter of however  pricing remains highly competitive and indicators having strong correlations to our order levels  such as unemployment rates and housing starts  remain weak 
therefore  we anticipate that recoveries in our order levels may be slow 
cost of sales gross margin in  cost of sales decreased million or 
the decline in units reduced costs by approximately million  while our material prices increased approximately million 
we initiated restructuring actions in and to create operating efficiencies and to reduce production costs 
we continued to realize savings from these actions of approximately million  allowing us to maintain a steady gross margin percentage as compared with despite declines in sales volume 
in addition  as we actively worked to reduce our inventories  some of our lifo inventory layers were liquidated contributing to a favorable lifo adjustment in cost of sales of approximately million 
the myc initiative also resulted in a restructuring plan that we began implementing in late we expect to realize additional production cost savings as a result in cost of sales decreased million or from to lower unit sales accounted for a decline of approximately million 
material prices increased approximately million  however  this increase was offset partially by million of cost savings in production and compensation costs realized as a result of the and restructuring actions 
despite a decline in revenue  the gross margin percentage improved slightly to in  compared with in selling  general and administrative expense selling and sales support research and development general and administrative expense depreciation amortization of pension net actuarial losses other pension and postretirement expense total selling  general and administrative expense total sg a expense declined million or in and or million in selling and sales support decreased in both and  primarily a result of prior restructuring actions  lower incentive compensation due to reduced revenue  and lower travel related expenses 
although overall compensation and related expenses were down for  total savings were offset slightly as a result of an extra week of payroll in our fiscal year 
overall  we have maintained the lower cost structure from our and restructuring plans resulting in lower general and administrative expenses  primarily in compensation and related expenses  travel  and professional services 
we experienced a spike in healthcare costs in of approximately million  however  healthcare expense in compared with was down million 
compensation and related expenses were also slightly higher in due to our week fiscal year 
because performance goals were not met  in we reversed approximately million of general and administrative expense recorded in prior years related to performance based restricted stock 
in  we also recorded approximately million of favorable non recurring items  primarily related to sales tax refunds 
depreciation trended lower in and as a result of lower capital expenditures in recent years 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized approximately million in accelerated depreciation expense as a result of changes required in the estimated useful lives of some assets affected by the new myc restructuring plans 
as myc and other strategic plans are completed  capital expenditures are expected to increase resulting in higher depreciation expense in future years 
amortization of pension net actuarial losses was million  million  and million in   and amortization has trended lower primarily as a result of the settlements that occurred in and  which are more fully discussed under pension curtailments and settlements 
during  the plan s assets experienced significant declines in market value due to the weak economic conditions at the end of although we experienced net actuarial gains in  the losses were not fully recovered 
therefore  the resulting net actuarial losses over the previous two years will be amortized in future years causing pension loss amortization to trend higher in future years 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates over the next three years  we project pension loss amortization to be million in  million in  and million in as a result of plan modifications in  other pension and postretirement costs declined in and expenses declined million in due primarily to the elimination of service costs for our qualified and non qualified plans  a reduction in interest costs for our qualified plan  and reduced costs related to our retiree healthcare plan 
in  other pension costs decreased million primarily due to decreased pension service costs resulting from the plan modifications 
pension curtailments and settlements pension curtailment and settlements were million  million  and million in   and a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial losses at the date of the settlement 
a curtailment results when benefits provided by a plan are increased or decreased due to plan amendments 
in  we recorded non cash settlement charges of million related to our qualified  non qualified and supplemental executive retirement plans due to employees retiring and electing lump sum payments of their benefits 
in  we modified the qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans for employees still accruing benefits under the plans 
effective june   these participants ceased accruing pension benefits and their final pension benefit amount will be based on pay and service through june  as a result  we recorded a curtailment gain of million in the second quarter of as a result of employees retiring and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefits  we also recorded non cash settlement charges of million in restructuring and other exit costs the company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies  reduce costs  and maintain a strong financial condition 
we recorded million  million  and million of restructuring and other exit costs in   and related to these savings initiatives 
we intend to continue to critically evaluate operations and costs and may initiate additional cost reducing initiatives or restructurings in the future 
the myc initiative on october   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan as a result of the myc initiative 
we plan to optimize our manufacturing footprint by investing in regional print on demand centers and scaling down our local print on demand centers  closing certain production and distribution centers  improving our supply chain  and simplifying processes 
we also plan to manage our working capital more effectively by moving to on demand based production  thereby lowering inventory and warehousing requirements 
implementation of ideas generated through the myc initiative will continue through  with a majority of the plans to be executed in the next months 
when fully implemented  we expect to achieve cost savings between and million  on an annual run rate basis compared with the fourth quarter of  through a combination of workforce reduction  strategic closure of production and distribution facilities  and other efficiency initiatives 
we expect to have involuntary termination costs of million for severance and outplacement services  contract termination costs of million for leased facilities  and other associated costs of million  primarily for fees to the third party that assisted with the development and implementation of the myc initiative and costs for the relocation of equipment and inventory 
in  we accrued million of the expected costs  of which million was paid 
during  we initiated a plan to close several print centers and integrate certain other print centers into our distribution warehouses to improve efficiency and reduce cost 
the last of these actions was completed during the first quarter of we expect to realize substantially all of our projected million savings 
also during  we began implementing a plan to redesign our client support infrastructure to more of a centralized model 
we transitioned customer transactional and administrative functions from our field sales offices to one of three client satisfaction centers by the end of september the overall benefit of the change is an optimized client support model along with significant annualized cost savings 
we originally expected these actions to generate approximately million annually in compensation and related cost savings to be reflected in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
we now expect the annual savings rate to be approximately million after reinvesting a portion of the savings into our client satisfaction operations 
as a result of the extended implementation time  we expect to realize the full effect of these savings in lastly  late in  we eliminated approximately positions throughout the company in response to revenue declines  soft inventory demand for some traditional products  and weak economic conditions 
annualized savings were expected to total approximately million in compensation and related savings  with approximately million to be reflected in cost of sales and million in sg a expense 
we have realized substantially all of our projected savings 
the majority of these costs were incurred in  however  restructuring and other exit costs of in primarily relate to for costs associated with the planned closing of facilities that are required to be expensed as incurred and a reversal of for lower than expected involuntary termination costs 
in  we implemented plans to reduce our annual operating costs by million 
we closed our middlebury  vermont production plant as part of a plan to consolidate our manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
the plant s productive capacity was transferred to three other existing plants 
we recorded million of restructuring costs related to the closing of the middlebury plant  million for involuntary termination costs  and million of other associated exit costs  primarily for equipment removal and relocation  employee relocation  and inventory write offs 
in addition  we eliminated approximately positions  primarily in management and overhead  representing million annually in compensation and related costs 
total restructuring costs were million for involuntary termination costs 
these restructuring actions have continued to produce benefits in and  contributing to the significant reduction in sg a expense and stable gross margin percentages despite significant declines in revenue in these years 
asset impairments asset impairments in were million 
we recognized an impairment of related to a trademark that was associated with our consulting and print asset optimization product line which was subsequently sold 
we also recognized impairment charges of  the majority of which was related to costs for internal use software in development that was determined to have no future benefit 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we conducted an extensive review of our property  plant  and equipment to determine if any assets were impaired 
the majority of assets reviewed were determined not to be impaired at this time  however  the remaining useful lives were adjusted to reflect updated expectations regarding the use and disposition of the assets 
changes to our restructuring plans could affect the ultimate use of these assets and result in impairment charges in future periods 
environmental remediation we currently participate in the remediation of three environmental sites 
prior to  our expenses related to these matters had not been significant 
however  in  we recorded noncash charges of million for estimated costs for environmental remediation 
of this amount  million related to the valleycrest landfill site 
we had participated with other potentially responsible parties of this site from through in  general motors corporation gm stepped into the company s position under the site participation agreement and agreed to indemnify the company against certain future liability in connection with the site 
therefore  we did not previously record a liability for potential remediation costs 
in  we were notified that in connection with gm s bankruptcy filing  gm does not plan to continue contributions to the site  including its contractual obligation to indemnify the company for future liability 
as we are in the early stages of developing a remediation plan with other potentially responsible parties  estimates of total projected costs are difficult to determine 
additionally  since the final potentially responsible parties and their respective shares of the remediation costs have not been determined at this time  uncertainty exists as to what our final share of the total costs may be 
therefore  we could experience increased costs in future periods as the remediation process progresses 
other income expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in  compared with million and million in and the decreases in and were primarily the result of lower debt balances and declining interest rates during and income taxes the effective tax rate used to calculate our tax benefit or expense was   and for   and the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows statutory federal income tax rate state and local income taxes change in cash surrender value state rate changes permanent and other items effective tax rate changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held in a rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan are not includable in taxable income and create differences between our statutory and effective tax rates 
in  we experienced a significant decline in value that was not deductible for tax purposes  increasing our effective rate by 
the decline in effective rate for our permanent items in was primarily due to stock option cancellations and restricted stock awards released 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations declined million in as compared with  primarily due to non cash pension settlement charges of million 
income from continuing operations almost doubled in from a loss of million in to income of million in  despite the significant decline in revenue 
this increase is primarily a result of the significantly lower pension loss amortization and other sg a costs  lower restructuring charges  and lower interest expense

the segment information presented in note segment reporting of the notes to financial statements is also presented on this basis 
a complete description of our reportable segments is included in item  business 
components of segment operating income production costs of our manufacturing and supply chain shared services functions are accumulated on a customer basis and reported in the applicable business unit s cost of sales 
our business units incur a portion of selling  general and administrative expense directly 
each business unit also receives an allocation of sg a expense as follows each business unit has its own sales regions 
selling expense incurred by each sales region is allocated to other business unit s based on the percentage of revenue generated for the other business unit 
we use an activity based method to allocate expense associated with our client satisfaction function to business units 
finance  technology  and other corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated based on the business unit s actual revenue as a percentage of actual consolidated revenue 
general and administrative expense of our remaining shared services is allocated based on a percentage of actual revenue 
variability in the segment s actual revenue or the level of selling or corporate sg a expense to allocate can have a significant impact on segment profitability

healthcare our healthcare segment serves hospitals and other providers of healthcare and related services 
this market is undergoing fundamental change as advancing technologies and the focus on patient safety and cost efficiencies are transforming how patient information is obtained and maintained throughout the patient care process 
these factors are leading to a shift from printed patient documents and records to electronic medical records  steadily reducing demand for most traditional print products while increasing demands for digital document solutions and safety products 
poor economic conditions in and have also negatively impacted customers in this market leading to delays in capital projects  increased pricing pressures  and reduced demand 
revenue in our healthcare segment declined million or in compared with we estimate that the extra week of revenue in was approximately million  which lessened the overall revenue decline 
the largest revenue declines were in our traditional print products such as clinical documents and checks  which were offset in part by increases in our billing statements  wristbands  and prescription pads 
weak economic conditions were a leading factor in this decline  as our customers focused on cost containment  sought price concessions  and delayed or reduced order levels 
the proliferation of technology also continued to negatively affect revenue and accounting for a significant portion of the overall revenue decline as customers were able to utilize technology to produce or eliminate the need for some of the products we provide 
in  revenue declined million or as compared with the decline was primarily driven by a poor economy which constricted customer spending and increased pricing pressures in the latter part of the year  although revenue from new contracts increased as compared with the majority of the declines were in our traditional print products and labels which were offset by revenue gains in our secure prescriptions and marketing and training solutions 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue due to units and price for and changes in product mix did not materially contribute to the change in revenue 
of revenue change units price beginning in and continuing in  we saw our existing customers restrict spending and delay capital projects which negatively impacted units 
the rate of unit declines in the second half of was slightly lower than in the first half as a result of increases in our customer base  increased sales within our existing customer base for certain growth targeted products  and higher customer retention rates 
we attribute these positive trends to a more focused sales effort as a result of our vertical market strategy 
during  we secured a contract with novation  the largest group purchasing organization gpo  in the healthcare market 
we now have contractual agreements with all six of the major gpos 
this contract will provide access to a larger customer base  and we expect to see an increase in units in as a result 
the net increase in pricing in reflects an increase in prices for the pass through of material costs which were partially offset by pricing concessions caused by weak economic conditions in the last half of pricing on the supply side stabilized during  leading to less price increases passed on to customers as the year progressed 
at the same time  price pressures from our customers continued to intensify as they focused on cost reductions 
within the healthcare market  we are a supplier to the six largest group purchasing organizations 
as part of our supplier agreements  we provide specified discounts to customers that are members of these organizations 
accordingly  pricing with various member customers decreased during the last half of all of these factors resulted in an overall decline in pricing for we expect these trends to continue  resulting in an overall decline in pricing in as well 
the following table details the estimated changes in our cost of sales related to units and price of cost of sales change units price in  cost of sales declined million  primarily related to the decline in units 
the net price decrease consisted of a decrease due to lower production costs realized from our cost reduction initiatives offset by an increase of resulting from increases in our material costs 
the gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent in compared with due in large part to success in our cost containment initiatives 
in  cost of sales declined million compared with we estimate the increase in pricing resulted from an increase in material costs of offset by a decrease in production costs 
operating income declined million in compared with despite declines in volume  the percentage of operating income to revenue was consistent with as a result of reductions in sg a expenses attributable to our cost reduction actions taken in and operating income in declined million or as a result of the reduction in gross margin of million  offset by approximately million in cost savings from our restructuring and cost containment initiatives 
although we expect to see an increase in revenue in as a result of the novation contract  we do not expect a material effect on operating income due to the discounts provided to customers as part of that agreement 
financial services our financial services segment operates in a market where advancing technologies continue to transform the products and services desired by our customers and to create pressures on pricing 
the volatile economic conditions in and have also particularly impacted financial services customers leading to consolidations within the industry  intense customer focus on cost reductions  and highly competitive conditions 
these factors have also led to an increase in the adoption of digital technologies further impacting demand and prices for traditional print products 
revenue declined million or in compared with the extra week of revenue in was approximately million 
we estimate that economic conditions accounted for approximately of the decline in revenue due to bank consolidations  reduced demand  and pricing concessions 
financial customers aggressively sought price reductions and also in sourced products as a means for eliminating costs 
the remainder of the revenue decline was primarily attributable to the continued adoption of technology 
we believe weak economic conditions were a major factor increasing the rate of adoption during this time 
in  revenue declined million or as compared with  driven primarily by pricing concessions and reduced demand due to the significant downturn in the economy in the following table summarizes the estimated changes in overall revenue due to units and price for and changes in product mix did not materially contribute to the change in revenue 
of revenue change units price units declined in and primarily as a result of a depressed economy 
pricing remained positive in and due to price increases for the pass through of material costs 
however  as our material pricing stabilized late in and into  pricing concessions to our customers trended higher  partially offsetting gains from the pass through our material costs 
the following table details the estimated changes in our cost of sales related to units and price of cost of sales change units price cost of sales declined million in as compared with primarily due to units 
we realized production cost savings  primarily in compensation and supply chain costs  of approximately due to our cost reduction initiatives in these savings were offset slightly by an increase in material costs of approximately  resulting in a net decrease in pricing 
as a result  the gross margin percentage increased from in to in in  cost of sales declined compared with driven primarily by unit declines 
increased material costs of approximately were offset partially by production cost reductions of approximately realized as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions 
the net effect of the decline in cost of sales increased the gross margin percentage from in to in as a percentage of revenue  operating income improved by almost in and slightly in the improvement reflects the realized savings in cost of sales and sg a expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions 
emerging our emerging segment also operates in a market being affected by digital advances 
customer adoption of digital technologies has reduced demand in traditional print products creating excess capacity and increased price competition  while at the same time creating new opportunities for print on demand and digital based products 
additionally  products sold in this segment are heavily weighted toward customer spending on transactional documents  training  advertising  and payroll services 
therefore  a strong correlation exists between the demand for most of our products and the economic conditions within the market and unemployment rates 
revenue for our emerging segment declined million or in compared with the extra week contributed approximately million in revenue which helped lessen the overall decline from year to year 
we attribute weak economic conditions to approximately half of the overall decline 
downward pressures on demand have steadily increased in response to the downturn in the economy and the resulting high unemployment rates and customer focus on cost reduction 
we derive our revenue from several major market sectors which include business services  transportation  wholesale  retail  and government 
with the exception of our wholesale sector  which increased slightly due to an increase in new customers  revenue was lower across all of our primary sectors within this segment 
declines were most prominent with our business services customers  accounting for almost half of the overall revenue decli ne  primarily attributable to the high unemployment rates and poor economic conditions throughout declines with our transportation customers primarily were the result of customer divestitures and consolidations driven by poor economic conditions 
our retail customers experienced lower consumer demand  which in turn led to lower demand for our products and increased pressure on our pricing 
declines with our government customers primarily related to reduced demand and lower sales prices 
in  revenue declined million or as compared with volatile economic conditions during and an increased rate of adoption of digital technologies during the year accounted for approximately of the overall revenue decline 
revenues from our business services  transportation  retail  and manufacturing customers were most affected by these factors 
these customers aggressively sought pricing concessions  utilized existing technologies  and in sourced portions of the products and services we provide in order to reduce costs 
additionally  declines within our wholesale group resulted from business decisions to discontinue some low margin products 
revenue from government customers increased primarily as a result of increased sales in our department of motor vehicle products 
the following table summarizes the estimated changes in overall revenue due to units and price for and changes in product mix did not materially contribute to the changes in revenue 
of revenue change units price unit declines in and were driven primarily by the downturn in the economy and further erosion of demand for traditional print products due to an accelerated rate of adoption of digital technologies 
we attribute the increase in adoption of digital technologies to our customers increased focus on cost reductions prompting consideration of existing technologies as a way to create efficiencies and reduce or eliminate costs 
units declined in all of our sectors in except for our government group which increased units as a result of sales growth to state governments 
in  units also declined across all of our major sectors with the exception of our wholesale group 
however  declines were most prominent within our business services group which accounted for more than half of the unit decline 
additionally  declines within our transportation group accounted for another third of the unit decline 
units declined at a lower rate during the second half of primarily due to increases in our customer base and increased sales in some growth targeted products 
pricing steadily declined in due to the weak economic conditions and lower material price increases passed on to our customers 
in  the pass through of our material price increases to our customers outpaced the declines in pricing that resulted from competitive conditions created by the weak economy 
the following table details the estimated changes in our cost of sales related to units and price of cost of sales change units price costs of sales declined million in compared with  primarily the result of unit declines 
additionally  production costs  primarily consisting of compensation and supply chain costs  were reduced by as part of our workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in and these decreases were offset by an approximate increase in paper costs 
a large portion of the unit declines in were in products with higher gross margin percentages which contributed to the decline in the overall gross margin percentage for the year 
in  costs of sales declined million as compared with due to the large decline in units 
manufacturing costs also declined substantially by approximately  primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives in the last half of these savings were partially offset by a increase in material prices  resulting in a net decline in pricing 
as a result  the gross margin percentage increased in despite the significant decline in sales volume 
operating income declined million from operating profit of million in to an operating loss of million in the decline in operating income resulted from reduced gross margin of million offset by sg a savings of approximately million 
the sg a savings were realized primarily in compensation costs as part of our workforce reduction and other cost reduction initiatives completed in late and early  as well as a reduction in total sg a expenses  which resulted in a lower allocation to the segment 
in  operating income increased from a loss of million to operating profit of million as a result of the significant cost improvements in production costs and sg a expenses 
industrial our industrial segment has been particularly affected by the downturn in the economy late in and throughout primary customers are manufacturers of products directly affected by discretionary spending levels of consumers and products supporting the housing industry 
as consumer demand retracted in and  manufacturers scaled back their production significantly 
the reduction in demand for our products led to revenue declines of million in and million in in  the overall revenue decline was lessened by approximately million of revenue due to the extra week 
despite overall revenue declines in and  this segment has continued to increase revenue from new business contracts each year 
the table below describes the estimated changes in revenue attributable to units  price  and mix for and of revenue change units price the unit declines in and were primarily the result of reduced demand for our products caused by the slowdown in the economy 
in both years  we experienced overall declines in all of our major product offerings 
in  units declined overall despite increases in units resulting from new business contracts during the year 
in the second half of  we saw a reduction in the number and length of our customer s temporary plant shutdowns 
this trend resulted in a minor increase in order levels later in  which helped to slightly lessen the overall unit decline for the year 
pricing concessions increased and our material prices stabilized in as a result of the weakened economy 
however  overall pricing increased as we more diligently passed through prior year material price increases 
in  pricing decreased as concessions to our customers increased in response to weakening economic conditions and material price increases were not fully passed through to our customers by year end 
material prices are expected to increase during  however  we typically have been able to recover these costs by increasing our product prices 
despite the difficult economic climate this year  we have increased our customer base during we expect this to result in a positive revenue trend over the long term once consumer spending levels return to normal levels and the housing market stabilizes 
the following table details the estimated changes in our cost of sales related to price and units of cost of sales change units price cost of sales declined million in compared with primarily the result of the significant unit declines in costs increased approximately due to material prices 
we continued to realize savings from our cost initiatives taken in of approximately  however  the savings were offset by increased start up costs associated with our new dayton in mold label plant of approximately 
as a result  the gross margin percentage declined for in  costs of sales were consistent with as the decrease in costs due to units was offset by pricing increases 
pricing increased approximately due to increased material costs and changes in product mix 
these increases were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs of approximately resulting from our and restructuring actions 
approximately of the savings realized in production costs was offset in part by increases in material costs and increased start up costs related to our in mold product line 
as a result  the gross margin percentage declined from to in in  operating income was down million from an operating profit of million in to an operating loss of million in the decrease in gross margin contributed to million of the decline which was offset by decreased sg a expenses of approximately million 
this decrease was primarily related to reduced selling and administrative expenses as a result of our cost reduction actions taken in and operating income in declined million compared with as a result of the decline in gross margin 
this segment incurred more direct sg a expenses that were unaffected by many of the cost reduction initiatives in in addition  this segment incurs direct sg a costs that vary upon transaction volume  such as the number of customer orders 
although the amount of units sold was lower from year to year  the actual number of orders remained relatively consistent 
as such  many direct sg a expenses were basically flat from year to year 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which include both continuing and discontinued operations  plus a summary of our significant contractual obligations 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
because our outstanding debt is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million subject to limitations related to receivable balances and letters of credit  we measure cash flow performance prior to debt borrowing or repayment 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized in the following table  followed by an analysis of the items affecting these elements cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items working capital restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan deferred compensation payments and other net cash provided by operating activities acquisitions capital expenditures proceeds from sale of plant  equipment  and discontinued operations net cash used for investing activities debt borrowings payments dividends paid other net cash used for financing activities net change in cash memo add back debt borrowed paid cash flow before change in debt operating activities in  cash provided by operations declined as compared with due to higher restructuring spending  increased payouts for our non qualified and deferred compensation plans  and lower operating profit due to the decline in sales volume 
cash provided by operations rose significantly in driven by lower working capital  reduced restructuring spending  and lower deferred compensation payments 
restructuring payments were higher in compared with as we progressed with the plans initiated in late and began implementing the myc restructuring plans 
we expect additional cash requirements related to the myc initiative to be in the range of to million  with the majority of this occurring over the next twelve months 
contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million in  versus million in and the pension protection act of ppa became effective in and requires an increased level in the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
based upon the new requirements  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  with minimum funding requirements in and estimated to be million and million 
we anticipate making contributions in excess of the minimum in order to lower required minimum contributions in later years 
therefore  we are estimating that actual cash contributions will be million in and million in and currently  there is proposed legislation working through congress that may change the funding rules to provide funding relief  however  at this time we are unable to determine what effect this legislation may have on our required contr ibutions or the likelihood of its passage 
deferred compensation balances paid to employees and payments of supplementary pension benefits were significantly higher in and due to employees retiring and electing lump sum payments of their benefits during those years 
in  these payments were partially offset by million in cash received from the deferred compensation trust 
investing activities capital spending was in the million range in and in  we limited our capital spending primarily to projects with higher returns on invested capital and those required to maintain operations  lowering our capital expenditures to million 
we continued this trend in resulting in capital expenditures of only million 
as a result of the myc initiative and anticipated strategic investments to transform our product portfolio  we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in in and  we expect to replace a substantial portion of our print on demand equipment with devices having advanced color and technological capabilities necessary for developing our product portfolio going forward 
we estimate the total cost of the project will million  with approximately million paid under lease commitments over months and the remainder under normal purchase terms 
in  proceeds from the sale of our middlebury facility and our digital solutions business contributed to million of cash provided from the sale of assets 
financing activities in  we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million 
savings from our cost reduction initiatives  lower dividend payments  and reduced capital expenditures allowed us to substantially absorb the lower operating profit and higher restructuring costs and payouts in our deferred compensation and other supplemental retirement plans 
improved working capital management  cost savings  and relatively low capital expenditures provided available cash to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million during dividend payments to shareholders were lower in compared with and  as our board of directors in february of this year elected to reduce the quarterly dividend from to per share beginning with the second quarter 
this decision was made after giving consideration to the economic environment and the company s strategy  equity position  and near term capital needs 
the amount of subsequent dividend payments will be determined on a quarter by quarter basis 
cash flow has been more than adequate to fund the dividend over the last five years 
however  it is our board s opinion that capital preservation and prudent investments in pursuit of our strategy best serves the company s long term interests 
our shareholders equity ended the year at approximately million 
further reductions in the level of shareholders equity could limit our ability to declare dividends in the future 
under ohio law  a company cannot declare a dividend in excess of its surplus the difference between total shareholders equity and the par value of outstanding shares 
the company s surplus was million at year end 
capital structure our capital structure appears in the table below capital structure total debt less cash and short term investments net debt equity total net debt total capital net debt in remained relatively consistent with  despite lower operating profit due to the weak economy and higher restructuring costs 
net debt decreased during from million at the outset of the year to an ending balance of million  reflecting a net cash inflow of million 
the company currently has a million senior secured revolving credit agreement credit facility with seven banks that permits borrowing and repayment as needed 
the credit facility  which expires in may  is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  and certain other assets 
borrowings are limited to of eligible receivable balances less letters of credit 
there is a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below million 
at year end  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million and available unborrowed credit was million 
our available credit declined during the year due to the decrease in our accounts receivable balances  as our level of borrowing is subject to limitations based upon these balances 
interest on the revolver is at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable spread based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
at the end of january  the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  had dropped to versus at december  in addition  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility  payable at an annual rate of basis points 
since our credit facility expires in may  the million of debt is classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we are currently renegotiating the credit facility and expect to reach an agreement by the end of the first quarter in the market and availability of asset backed loans remains strong despite the recent turmoil within the credit markets  however  the costs associated with loans have increased 
as a result  we expect the costs associated with our new agreement to be significantly higher than our existing agreement  which at current debt levels could result in increased interest expense of approximately million annually 
however  we expect our new agreement to provide us with an increased borrowing limit 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  dividends  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
we believe our major long term cash requirements consist of investing in our growth initiatives aimed at transforming our product portfolio and our pension funding 
while we have taken steps to enable us to adequately fund these items  actual amounts required may be higher than estimated due to the uncertainty in determining the exact amounts needed 
in our judgment  our strong balance sheet could support additional debt financing
