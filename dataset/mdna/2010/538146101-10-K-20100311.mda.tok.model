december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents    working capital     total assets     total stockholders equity    item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience  future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material 
overview liveperson provides online engagement solutions that facilitate real time assistance and expert advice 
connecting businesses and independent experts with individual consumers seeking help on the web  our hosted software platform creates more relevant  compelling and personalized online experiences 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in november and the liveperson service was introduced in november the company is organized into two operating segments 
the business segment facilitates real time online interactions chat  voice click to call  email and self service knowledgebase for global corporations of all sizes 
the consumer segment facilitates online transactions between independent experts and individual consumers 
in order to sustain growth in these segments  our strategy is to expand our position as the leading provider of online engagement solutions that facilitate real time assistance and expert advice 
to accomplish this  we are focused on the following current initiatives upgrading our technology 
we are increasing the level of automation used to deploy our services within the business segment enabling faster  more efficient deployment and expansion 
we are also investing in data reporting tools that will enable our customers to analyze their online businesses at a more detailed level and with greater reporting flexibility 
we are implementing a new billing platform for the consumer segment that will allow greater fee structure flexibility in how we charge consumers 
expanding our international presence 
we are increasing our investment in large international markets primarily in western europe where we can leverage our brand recognition and potentially expand our client base 

table of contents reorganizing and expanding our sales organization to improve operating efficiencies 
we recently restructured our sales force with a single head of sales to leverage symmetries between our direct sales force and the sales force for small and mid sized businesses smb 
in addition  we created a middle market sales team to target companies that have growing contact centers and moderate website traffic 
with a targeted product offering and dedicated sales team  we can more effectively serve this area of the market 
fourth quarter and year ended highlights of the three months and year ended december  compared to the comparable periods in are as follows revenue increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in gross profit margin increased to in the three and twelve months ended december  from and in the comparable periods in operating expenses decreased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in the decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of million in net income increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from net loss of million for the three and twelve months ended december  on october   we acquired kasamba inc  a facilitator of online transactions between independent service providers experts  who provide expert online advice to individual consumers users for total consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition accelerated our expansion into the business to consumer market  and is expected to extend the value we deliver to our growing base of business customers through a community that will connect consumers with experts in a range of categories 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of kasamba in exchange for  shares of our common stock  million in cash and the assumption of  kasamba options 
the net intangibles of million and million are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  and december  balance sheets  respectively 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the liveperson services 
because we provide our application as a service  we follow the provisions of asc s  revenue recognition and  revenue recognition with multiple element arrangements 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
the majority of our larger clients also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
we defer these implementation fees and associated direct costs and recognize them ratably over the expected term of the client relationship upon commencement of the hosting services 
we may also charge professional service fees related to additional training  business consulting and analysis in support of the liveperson services 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for small and mid sized businesses smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 

table of contents we recognize monthly service revenue based upon the fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable or may terminate upon to days notice without penalty 
when professional service fees provide added value to the customer on a standalone basis  we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance because we have established objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered hosting services 
if a professional services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the fees  and the related labor costs  ratably over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the client relationship 
for revenue generated from online transactions between experts and users  we recognize revenue net of expert fees in accordance with asc  principle agent considerations  due to the fact that we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection 
we collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee  and then remit the balance to the expert 
revenue from these transactions is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
stock based compensation we follow asc  stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
asc is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
asc requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december    and reflect the impact of asc in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of asc asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the years december    and includes compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to  but not fully vested as of january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with asc as well as compensation expense for share based awards granted subsequent to january  in accordance with asc we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine grant date fair value 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
accounts receivable our customers are located primarily in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be 
table of contents adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to our large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and one customer accounted for approximately of accounts receivable at december  no single customer accounted for or exceeded of accounts receivable at december  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales and to the fact that a larger proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate clients that typically have longer payment cycles  and we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance for doubtful accounts of  goodwill in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we will obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we will perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
in  the company evaluated goodwill using a combination of discounted cash flows  prior transactions and quoted market prices methods and determined that no impairment had occurred 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates

this update also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability and that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations as a result of the expanding scope of our israeli operations  our currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the us dollar against the new israeli shekel nis has increased 
for the year ended december   the u 
s dollar appreciated against the nis to levels more consistent with the recent historical average which had a positive impact on our results of operations and financial conditions when compared to for the year ended december   expenses generated by our israeli operations totaled million 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency risk exposure 
we actively monitor the movement of the us dollar against the nis and uk pound and have considered the use of financial instruments  including but not limited to derivative financial instruments  which could mitigate such risk 
if we determine that our risk of exposure materially exceeds the potential cost of derivative financial instruments  we may in the future enter in to these types of investments 
the functional currency of our wholly owned israeli subsidiaries  liveperson ltd 
formerly humanclick ltd 
and kasamba ltd  is the us dollar and the functional currency of our operations in the united kingdom is the uk pound
