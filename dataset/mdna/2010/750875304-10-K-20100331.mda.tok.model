in july  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of qinteraction limited  which operates an offshore call center located in the philippines 
qinteraction provides a variety of business solutions including inbound sales and order taking  inbound customer care  outbound telemarketing and lead generation  logistics support  and back office processing 
the nature of these services is highly complimentary to our existing lead development and contract sales product offerings 
in october  we acquired the ecommerce technology of grow commerce 
grow commerce provides hosting of fan club and membership websites that offer monthly subscriptions and the ability for fee based downloading of music  videos and other items 
additionally  the technology offers the ability to route orders of merchandise for fulfillment 
we plan to integrate and leverage the grow commerce assets to advance our ecommerce strategy during the fiscal year 
we reported net revenue of million in  representing a decline over the prior year 
we reported a net loss of million for on february   we received written notice from sun microsystems that they had elected to terminate the global inside sales program statement of work agreement dated march   effective as of february  the notice followed the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle corporation and affected the contract sales services that we were performing for sun 
these services accounted for approximately of our fiscal annual revenue and of our fourth quarter fiscal revenue 
the global inside sales agreement had a minimum term with notice periods to august  we entered into a settlement agreement on march   and received a cash payment of  from oracle corporation for the buyout of the global inside sales agreement 
in addition  oracle has agreed to reimburse us for the employee severance costs related to terminating employees who worked on the global inside sales program 
net revenue we derive revenue from the following the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties contract sales  from the provision of services related to the development of qualified leads and appointments lead development  from the licensing of our hosted application software platform for our clients training sales training sales  and from hosting fees related to the grow commerce ecommerce technology 
service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions contract sales 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions and warranty extensions 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our client s customer 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the renewal amount based on the agreement with our client 
we record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms  generally to days from the initial sale 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale  and none of our clients 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customers represented more than of our revenue 
because our revenue from sales of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions are commission based  this revenue can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have two to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
we recently started to provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development 
we provide lead development services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 
some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
application software training sales 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one year terms  and are often paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
ecommerce 
during  we acquired the ecommerce technology of grow commerce along with their existing customer base 
grow commerce provides hosting of fan club and membership websites that offer monthly subscriptions and the ability for fee based downloading of music  videos and other items 
additionally  the ecommerce technology offers the ability to route orders of merchandise for fulfillment 
we license this hosted ecommerce software on a month to month basis with our clients 
clients are typically invoiced at the beginning of each month in advance for their monthly hosting fees for that month and for the media downloads and merchandise orders from the previous month 
payment terms are days from receipt of invoice and we typically recognize revenue when the monthly invoice payments are received 
ecommerce revenue is included with our contract sales operating segment for as the total amount is insignificant for the year 
gross margin gross margin is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products or delivering our services to our clients 
cost of services include compensation costs of sales personnel  sales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs of services are personnel related and are mostly variable in relation to our net revenue 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margins will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses  
table of contents 
index to financial statements participation in trade shows and conferences and client integration costs 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our rainmaker revenue delivery platform 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we have also invested in the continued development of our revenue delivery platform 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  legal  audit and other professional fees 
most of these costs relate to personnel  insurance and facilities and are relatively fixed 
stock based compensation fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and software licenses  and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of six businesses in the past four years  and accordingly have been increasing our intangible amortization expense 
in the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of cas systems  and in the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of qinteraction limited 
we took a charge to write down a significant portion of our amortizable intangible assets in the th quarter of and as a result amortization expense decreased significantly in see the discussions below regarding the goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment of goodwill other intangible assets 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on leases to secure equipment  software and other financing agreements  foreign currency gains losses  and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and has reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition and financial statement presentation  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals  lead development services  software subscriptions for hosted internet sales of web based training and from hosting fees related to the grow commerce ecommerce technology 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our clients service contracts and maintenance renewals on the net basis  which represents the amount billed to the end customer less the amount paid to our client 
revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from a client s customer is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our software 
table of contents 
index to financial statements application subscriptions of hosted online sales of web based training ratably over each contract period 
since these software subscriptions are usually paid in advance  we have recorded a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of subscriptions that will be earned over the next one to two years 
we also evaluate our agreements for multiple element arrangements 
our agreements typically do not contain multiple deliverables 
however  in the few instances where our agreements have contained multiple deliverables  they usually do not have value to our customers on a standalone basis  and therefore the deliverables are considered together as one unit of accounting 
revenue is then recorded using the proportional performance model  where revenue is recognized as performance occurs over the term of the contract and any initial set up fees are recognized over the estimated customer life 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectability 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our clients customers and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition  we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets we completed several acquisitions during the period january  through december  goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in our analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other subsequent measurement in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
in our analysis of other finite lived amortizable intangible assets  we apply the guidance of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and trade names of the businesses we have acquired 
in the th quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation required under fasb asc and concluded that goodwill was impaired along with our other intangible assets under fasb asc the impairment was a result of our market capitalization declining significantly with the price of our stock  declining sales  depressed market conditions  deteriorating industry trends  and a significant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements downward revision of our forecasts 
the ultimate result of the impairment evaluation was a charge in the th quarter of million to write off the entire amount of goodwill on two of our reporting units lead development and rainmaker asia and a charge of approximately million to write off a majority of the other intangible assets contained in these same two reporting units 
in the th quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and concluded that our remaining goodwill balance was not impaired 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill recorded on our contract sales reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately million or at december  we report segment results in accordance with asc  segment reporting 
the method for determining what information is reported is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments for making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance 
the company s chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis  accompanied by detailed information listing revenues by customer and product line  for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
currently the chief operating decision maker does not use product line financial performance as a basis for business operating decisions 
accordingly  the company has concluded that it has one operating and reportable segment 
however  in accordance with fasb asc  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
thus  our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are contract sales  lead development and rainmaker asia 
long lived assets long lived assets including our purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
in the th quarter of  in connection with the goodwill impairment testing discussed above  we had to evaluate our other long lived assets which included amortized intangible assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  internal use software and fasb asc  
table of contents 
index to financial statements website development costs 
this guidance requires that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of asc and asc have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific outsource client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
the liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in and  the deferred tax asset was subject to a valuation allowance and therefore is not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is limited and we may not be able to fully utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce our tax rates 
fasb asc  income taxes  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under this guidance  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy for recording interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes 
penalties  interest paid and interest received are recorded in interest and other income expense  net  in the statement of operations 
there were immaterial amounts accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of december  stock based compensation fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
see note for further discussion of this statement and its effects on the financial statements presented herein

revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year 
the related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant client concentrations we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers of a limited number of clients 
in the year ended december   three clients accounted for or more of our revenue with sun microsystems representing approximately of our revenue  hewlett packard representing approximately of our revenue and symantec accounting for approximately of our revenue 
in  hewlett packard accounted for approximately of our revenue and was the only client that accounted for or more of our revenue 
in  dell and hewlett packard each accounted for more than of our net revenue and collectively represented of our net revenue  with dell representing and hewlett packard representing approximately

our agreement with symantec  a significant client  was renewed on february   and is effective april  for a term of two years  expiring on march   if not renewed prior to expiration 
we have various agreements with sun microsystems  our largest client as of december   with various termination provisions ranging from termination with days notice to termination rights in august on february   we received written notice from sun microsystems that they had elected to terminate the global inside sales program statement of work agreement dated march   effective as of february  the notice followed the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle corporation and affected the contract sales services that we were performing for sun 
these services accounted for approximately of our fiscal annual revenue and of our fourth quarter fiscal revenue 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
related party transactions we have made purchases of computer equipment and services from several vendors including hewlett packard and symantec corporation  two of our largest clients that contributed or more of our revenue for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we purchased equipment from hewlett packard totaling approximately  we did not have any purchases from sun microsystems or symantec corporation during the year ended december   other than cost of sales transactions for our contract sales programs with symantec

impairment of goodwill other intangible assets 
in the st quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and no impairment existed at that time 
during  we changed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation date from january to october to better align this evaluation with our annual planning and budgeting process 
as of october   we started to perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at that time  our initial indications determined that goodwill was impaired 
additionally in the th quarter of  we again assessed goodwill and long lived assets for impairment as we observed that there were indicators of impairment 
the notable indicators were our market capitalization declined significantly with the price of our stock  depressed market conditions  deteriorating 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industry trends  and a significant downward revision of our forecasts 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
because of the decline in our market capitalization at december   we again tested for the potential impairment of goodwill as the decline in market capitalization was considered a triggering event for goodwill impairment testing  as well for amortizable intangible assets 
our goodwill and intangible assets were primarily established in purchase accounting at the completion of the sunset direct  view central  cas systems  and qinteraction acquisitions 
the projected discounted cash flows for our three reporting units contract sales  lead development  and rainmaker asia were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts through were estimated based on both the reporting units respective historical performance and comparison to comparable public companies 
the annual sales growth rates ranged from negative to positive during the discrete forecast period 
these forecasts represent the best estimate that our management had at the time and believe to be reasonable 
the terminal value of our reporting units was determined using the gordon growth model  which applied a long term revenue growth rate of 
the terminal value represents the value of our reporting units at the end of the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows and terminal value were discounted to present value using a discount rate range of 
the discount rate was based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of our reporting units 
prior to our goodwill impairment testing in the th quarter of  we also assessed the fair value of our long lived assets including our other finite lived amortizable intangible assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
the fair value of our amortized intangible assets which included developed technology  customer relations  database and trade name was determined using discounted cash flow and excess earnings income approaches 
the guidance in asc  intangibles goodwill and other subsequent measurement  provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
step of the impairment analysis determined that the carrying value of our lead development and rainmaker asia reporting units  subsequent to the impairment of our other finite lived amortizable intangible assets noted above  was greater than their fair value  and that the goodwill relating to these reporting units was impaired 
upon completion of step of the analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million on the lead development reporting unit and approximately million on the rainmaker asia reporting unit  representing the entire balance of goodwill at these reporting units

table of contents 
index to financial statements interest income is attributable to the investing of our cash balances in short term interest bearing deposit accounts 
interest rate decreases and our declining cash balance during contributed to the change in interest income for the year 
interest expense is the result of the million term loan obtained in february in connection with the acquisition of sunset direct  interest on the million june term loan to fund the purchase and implementation of our new client management system  interest incurred with respect to notes payable issued with the purchase of the assets of cas systems and interest expense on the million borrowed under our revolving line of credit during the th quarter of we have paid off the term loan and the june term loan during and have made the first of three principal payments on the cas systems notes during the change in currency translation gain is primarily due to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates on a note payable to a third party denominated in united states dollars that is owed by our canadian subsidiary in connection with our acquisition of cas systems 
fluctuations of currency exchange rates may have a negative effect in future periods on our financial results 
the write down of investment relates to our investment in a privately held company 
in october  we provided million in growth capital to this privately held company 
the transaction was structured as a million convertible loan and a million term loan secured by substantially all of the assets of the privately held company including intellectual property 
we also received a warrant as a part of this transaction to purchase approximately  shares of common stock of the privately held company 
in october  the convertible debt automatically converted to  shares of series a preferred stock of the privately held company 
because the private equity investment represents less than in the investee company  and because the company does not have any significant influence on the investee company  the investments are accounted for in accordance with the cost method and evaluated regularly for impairment indicators 
during the fourth quarter of  we assessed our investment for impairment as we observed that there were indicators of impairment 
the company is aware that the privately held company is operating at a loss  and while there is no quoted market prices available for the privately held company  as a marketing services company  it has likely been adversely affected by the recent economic downturn in a manner similar to rainmaker 
asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
asc has also established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
level inputs apply to the determination of fair value for the company s private equity investment 
these are unobservable inputs where the determination of fair values of investments requires the application of significant judgment 
management s valuation methodologies include fundamental analysis that evaluates the investee company s progress in developing products  building intellectual property portfolios and securing customer relationships  as well as overall industry conditions  conditions in and prospects for the investee s geographic region  overall equity market conditions  and the level of financing already secured and available 
this is combined with analysis of comparable acquisition transactions and values to determine if the security s liquidation preferences will ensure full recovery of the company s investment in a likely acquisition outcome 
in its valuation analysis  management also considers the most recent transaction in a company s shares 
in the th quarter of  we took a charge in other expense of approximately  which represented a write off of the remaining carrying value of the warrant of  and a write down of the carrying value of the investment in series a preferred stock of the privately held company of  in order to write down these assets to their respective fair values 
it is possible that the factors evaluated by management and fair values will change in subsequent periods  resulting in material impairment charges in future periods 
other relates primarily to the loss on disposal of fixed assets

income tax expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  even though we incurred a large loss in  we have not recorded any deferred tax benefits for such losses due to management s assessment that deferred tax assets are not more than likely to be realized in the future 
therefore  we recorded no deferred tax benefits for the losses 
in addition  certain of our current year losses are attributable to non tax deductible losses such as write of certain goodwill and intangibles in various jurisdictions  and thus do not create deferred tax benefits

when we sell a service or maintenance contract for a client  we record the sales price of the contract to the client s customer as our receivable and also record our payable to the client for our cost of the contract  which is effectively the same amount less our compensation for obtaining the contract for our client 
for this reason  our accounts payable includes amounts due to our clients for service and maintenance contracts we sold on their behalf 
accounts payable therefore decreases in relation to our decreased sales of service contracts on behalf of our clients 
accounts receivable decreased at december  as compared to december  as a result of lower overall sales during as compared to our days sales outstanding  or dso  decreased to days at december  as compared to days at december  since we record the gross billing to the end customer of our contract sales clients in our accounts receivable  we calculate dso based on our ability to collect those gross billings from the end customers
