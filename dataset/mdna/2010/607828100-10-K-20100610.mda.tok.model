approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated with the company s top ten customers 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
however  the current economic uncertaint y  especially within the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets  makes it difficult to predict future financial conditions of significant customers within these markets 
deterioration in the financial condition of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity

economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
the company sells a broad range of products that provide thermal solutions to a diverse group of customers operating primarily in the automotive  truck  heavy equipment and commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
the adverse events in the global financial markets over the past two years have created a significant downturn in the vehicular markets  in which the company competes  and to a lesser extent in the commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
the current economic uncertainty makes it difficult to predict future conditions within these markets 
a sustained economic downturn in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or the company s liquidity and potentially result in the impairment of related assets 
the company is responding to these market conditions through its continued implementation of its four point plan as follows manufacturing realignment aligning the manufacturing footprint to maximize asset utilization and improve the company s cost competitive position  portfolio rationalization identifying products or businesses that should be divested or exited as they do not meet required financial metrics  sg a expense reduction reducing sg a expenses and sg a expenses as a percentage of sales through diligent cost containment actions  and capital allocation discipline allocating capital spending to operating segments and business programs that will provide the highest return on investment 
with respect to international instability  the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
during fiscal there was weakening of the us dollar 
the euro and brazilian real strengthened against the dollar by percent and percent  respectively 
the chinese renminbi strengthened less than one percent against the us dollar in fiscal from march  through may   the us dollar has strengthened by approximately percent against the euro based on economic uncertainty within europe 
this results in foreign currency translation losses as the company translates the original equipment europe financial results into us dollars 
as modine expands its global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks 

table of contents the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to exhaust gas recirculation and waste heat recovery 
modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets emerge 
future recovery from the global recession or continued economic growth in china are expected to put production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of copper  steel and aluminum fin stock serving a more robust market 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
in addition to the purchase of raw materials  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in most instances  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier of such parts being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
the company has implemented a supplier risk management program that utilizes industry sources to identify and mitigate high risk supplier situations 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company attempts to offset these risks with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible but these agreements generally carry annual price down provisions as well 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any one or more of the markets it serves 
however  the risk associated with any market downturn  including the current global economic downturn  is still present 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum  nickel  and natural gas 
the company utilizes an aluminum hedging strategy from time to time by entering into fixed price contracts to help offset changing commodity prices 
the company utilizes collars from time to time for certain forecasted copper purchases  and also enters into forward contracts from time to time for certain forecasted nickel purchases 
the company does maintain agreements with certain customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fl uctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a quarter or longer 
hedging and foreign currency exchange contracts the company uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
their use is restricted primarily to hedging assets and obligations already held by modine  and they are used to protect cash flows rather than generate income or engage in speculative activity 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives the company enters into futures contracts from time to time related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of aluminum and natural gas 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchase of these commodities 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges by the company 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and natural gas impact earnings 
during the years ended march  and  million and m illion of expense  respectively  was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
at march   million of unrealized losses remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 
during fiscal  the company did not enter into any new futures contracts for commodities 

table of contents in addition  the company has entered into futures contracts from time to time related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of copper and nickel 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchases of these commodities 
the company has not designated these contracts as hedges  therefore  gains and losses on these contracts are recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no futures contracts entered into for fiscal during the year ended march  and  million of expense and million of income  respectively  was recorded in cost of sales related to these futures contracts 
foreign exchange contracts modine maintains a foreign exchange risk management strategy that uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
modine periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
generally  these contracts have terms of or fewer days 
the effect of this practice is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on modine s earnings 
modine s foreign currency exchange contracts do not subject it to significant risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
as of march   the company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 
non us dollar financing transactions through inter company loans or local borrowings in the corresponding currency generally are effective as hedges of long term investments 
the company has a number of investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and a non consolidated foreign joint venture 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility 
from time to time  the company uses non derivative financial instruments to hedge  or offset  this exposure 
interest rate derivatives as further noted above under the section entitled interest rate risk  the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivatives to manage the variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives have been treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and  accordingly  derivative gains or losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the borrowings 
counterparty risks the company manages counterparty risks by ensuring that counterparties to derivative instruments have credit ratings acceptable to the company 
at march   all counterparties had a sufficient long term credit rating
