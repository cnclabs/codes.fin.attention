item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
further information about each of our segments  and our business as a whole  is presented below 

table of contents our history qdi was formed in as a holding company known as mtl  inc in  we acquired chemical leaman corporation clc  thereby combining two of the then leading bulk service providers  montgomery tank lines and chemical leaman tank lines 
in  qdi changed its name from mtl  inc to quality distribution  inc 
on november   qdi consummated the initial public offering of its common stock 
boasso became our wholly owned subsidiary in december  when we acquired all of its outstanding capital stock from a third party 
qdi is owned principally by apollo 
as of december   apollo owned or controlled approximately of qdi s outstanding common stock  and approximately of qdi s common stock on a fully diluted basis 
our industry trucking we estimate  based on industry sources  that the highly fragmented north american for hire segment of the bulk transport market generated revenues of approximately billion in we specifically operate in the for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market estimated at billion in where we believe  based on published reports  we have achieved leading market share estimated at in  based on revenues 
based on revenues  we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network comprising terminals  tractors and trailers in north america 
we believe being a larger carrier facilitates customer service and lane density  and provides a better cost structure 
as such  we are well positioned to expand our business by increasing our market share 
the chemical bulk tank truck industry growth is generally dependent on i volume growth in the industrial chemical industry  ii the rate at which chemical companies outsource their transportation needs  iii the overall capacity of the rail system  and  in particular iv the extent to which chemical companies make use of the rail system for their bulk chemical transportation needs 
as competitive pressures force chemical companies to reduce costs and focus on their core businesses  we believe that chemical companies will consolidate their shipping relationships and outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 
we believe that large  national full service carriers will benefit from any such consolidation of relationships and outsourcing of logistics needs and will be able to grow faster than the overall bulk tank truck industry 
as a result of our leading market position  breadth of customer services  flexible business model and decentralized operating structure  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from industry outsourcing trends 
we expect the complexities and operational challenges faced by chemical manufacturers to continue to grow as the chemical industry evolves 
these complexities and challenges are driven by a variety of industry trends including customer demand for constantly lower prices  global import export of bulk liquid products and the need to get product into the pipeline 
in order to meet these challenges  we believe chemical producers will sell more through distribution as they look for ways to further reduce their costs by streamlining the supply chain 
we believe supply chain efficiencies will be one of the necessary fundamentals for chemical manufacturers competitiveness 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i obtain additional business from existing customers  ii add new customers  iii improve the utilization of our trailer fleet and iv add and retain qualified drivers 
while many of our customers source some of their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistics needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 

table of contents container services we estimate that the north american iso tank container transportation and depot services market generated revenues of approximately million in the iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the proliferation of global import export of bulk liquid chemicals has driven the movement of basic manufacturing out of the united states and has resulted in an increase in chemical plant infrastructure to service these off shore industries 
driven by this globalization  the iso tank container market is a growing sector of the overall liquid bulk chemical transportation sector 
if the chemical industry continues the recent trend towards the globalization of petro chemical manufacturing capacity  greater quantities of chemicals will be imported into the united states 
further  chemical manufacturers have sought to efficiently transport their products by utilizing iso tank containers 
the resulting demand for distributors that can offer a broad range of services within the supply chain will drive future industry growth in this sector 
we believe that boasso will benefit from these trends because of its market leadership 
competitive barriers our industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as i the time and cost required to develop the operational infrastructure necessary to handle sensitive chemical cargo  ii the financial and managerial resources required to recruit and train drivers  iii substantial industry regulatory requirements  and iv the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment and establish a network of terminals 
in addition  the industry continues to experience consolidation due to economic and competitive pressures  increasing operating costs for driver recruitment and insurance  and increasing capital investments for equipment and technology 
as the cost and complexity of operating a bulk tank truck business and iso tank container and depot services increase  we believe that large  well established carriers like us will gain market share 
customers our revenue base consists of customers located throughout north america  including many fortune companies and other major companies engaged in chemical processing  such as dow chemical company  procter gamble  ashland chemical company  ppg industries  and rohm haas 
in  and  our largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues for our trucking segment 
competition the tank truck business is competitive and fragmented 
we compete primarily with other tank truck carriers and dedicated private fleets in various states within the united states and canada 
competition from for hire carriers is comprised of fewer than ten large carriers  many with other businesses that do not compete with ours  and more than smaller  primarily regional carriers 
with respect to certain aspects of our business  we also compete with intermodal transportation and railroads 
intermodal transportation has increased in recent years 
competition for the bulk tank truck services is based primarily on rates and service 
we believe that we enjoy significant competitive advantages over other tank truck carriers because of our variable cost structure  overall fleet size and national terminal network 
boasso competes primarily with other national  regional and local tank truck carriers and dedicated private fleets as well as local and regional dry container transporters 
competition in the iso container services business depends on which competitors have facilities that are proximate to the ports serviced by boasso 
among competitors for a port location  competition is based primarily on rates and service 
competition from non trucking modes of transportation and from intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal fuel taxes were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation 

table of contents our competitive strengths following are our strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully exploit the market opportunities described above 
largest tank truck network in a fragmented industry we provide our customers with access to the largest tractor and tank trailer network in the north american bulk tank truck industry 
in addition  our nationwide network consisting on december  of trucking terminals and eight iso depot services terminals covers all major north american chemical markets and enables us to serve customers with international  national and regional shipping requirements 
our size allows us  our affiliates and our independent owner operators to benefit from economies of scale in the purchasing of supplies and services  including fuel  tires and insurance coverage 
our greater network density allows us to create efficiencies by increasing utilization through reduced empty miles with more opportunities to generate backhaul loads 
our size also enables us to invest in new technologies that increase our operating efficiency  improve customer service and lower our costs 
asset light business model our extensive use of affiliates and independent owner operators results in a highly variable cost structure and significantly reduces our capital investment  thereby allowing us to increase our asset utilization 
this model also contributes to the stability of our cash flow and margins and increases our return on capital 
affiliates are responsible for capital investments and most of the operating expenses related to the business they service 
typically  affiliates purchase or lease tractors for their business directly from the manufacturers and lease trailers from us 
independent owner operators are independent contractors who supply one or more tractors and drivers for our own or our affiliates exclusive use 
as with affiliates  independent owner operators are responsible for most of the operating expenses related to the business they transport excluding costs related to the acquisition and maintenance of trailers 
with our extensive use of independent owner operators and affiliates  we can reduce the high capital costs of purchasing and maintaining tractors 
broad menu of complementary services our ability to provide value added services that enhance our core service differentiates us from smaller competitors and enables us to gain market share  particularly with large customers that seek to use a limited number of core carriers 
our ability to offer an additional complement of services to our customers corroborates our position as a leading national full service provider in the industry 
these services include storage and warehousing  vendor managed inventory  load tendering  liquid and dry bulk rail to truck transfer facilities  border crossing operations and managing private fleets 
enhanced productivity  efficiency and customer service through installed technology we are proactive in our utilization of technology aimed at improving our customer service and operating efficiency 
in contrast to many of our smaller competitors  we have equipped our drivers with various mobile communications systems which enable us to monitor our tractors and communicate with our drivers in the field and enable customers to track the location and monitor the progress of their cargo through the internet 
we also have satellite tracking devices on our trailers to enable us to increase trailer utilization 
our website allows our customers to view bills and generate customized service reports 
we have a centralized order entry  dispatch and billing program system  which enhances our control over our equipment and drivers 
this technology is increasingly important when transporting sensitive cargo in today s heightened security environment 

table of contents our operations strategy we have simplified our business model to focus on our core operations 
during and we implemented substantial cost reduction initiatives and transitioned company owned terminals and operations to our affiliates 
additionally  on october   we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our qsi tank wash subsidiary 
as a result  we have generally exited the tank wash market and operate our chemical bulk tank truck network primarily through our affiliates 
we believe that our focus on core operations and our cost reductions will enable us to operate our business more efficiently and build a solid infrastructure to position us for growth once the economic environment improves 
our focus on our affiliate model  use of independent owner operators  safety and training and asset utilization as described below has gained momentum and has positioned us to capitalize on the market opportunities that lie ahead 
affiliate trucking operations we continue to focus on a less capital intensive business model based on affiliates and independent owner operators 
in  we transitioned the majority of company operated terminals to affiliates 
these actions resulted in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by affiliates in as compared to  and we expect an even larger portion of our revenue to be generated by affiliates in we believe these actions will reduce certain fixed costs and provide a more variable cost structure 
each affiliate is an independent company that has an exclusive contract with us to operate under the identity of qci and receive a percentage of gross revenues collected on each shipment they transport 
affiliates are responsible for their own operating expenses and they own or lease their terminals 
we reimburse affiliates for certain expenses billed back to customers  including fuel surcharges  tolls and scaling charges 
affiliates employ drivers and manage independent owner operators  pay all tractor operating expenses  lease trailers from us and provide a national network capacity 
we provide cash flow  back office and sales support  technology and regulatory oversight 
affiliate contracts generally contain restrictive covenants prohibiting them from competing directly with qci for a period of at least one year following termination of the contract 
independent owner operators we and our affiliates extensively utilize independent owner operators 
independent owner operators are independent contractors who  through a contract with qci  supply one or more tractors and drivers for qci or affiliate use 
independent owner operators contracts generally are terminable by either party upon short notice 
in exchange for the services rendered  independent owner operators are normally paid a fixed percentage of the revenues collected on each load hauled or on a per mile rate 
the percentage of revenues paid to independent owner operators by us is lower than the percentage paid to affiliates 
independent owner operators pay all tractor operating expenses such as fuel  physical damage insurance  tractor maintenance  fuel taxes and highway use taxes 
however  we reimburse independent owner operators for certain expenses passed through to our customers  such as tolls and scaling charges 
we operate programs intended to benefit independent owner operators by reducing their operating expenses such as tractors  fuel  tires  occupational accident insurance and physical damage insurance 
we compete with other motor carriers for the services of our drivers and independent owner operators 
our overall size and our reputation for good relations have enabled us to attract qualified professional drivers and independent owner operators 

table of contents safety and training we have made safety a main focus of our organization 
we implemented several comprehensive process improvement programs to further identify and implement opportunities for sustainable safety improvement 
tangible results of this focus have already manifested themselves in a substantial decrease in preventable events and claim frequency 
we also redesigned our driver training program and updated our online training system to make safety awareness training portable and available to the drivers  dispatchers and terminal managers via the internet 
trailer utilization at december   we owned more than  trailers  the majority of which we lease to affiliates 
trailer leasing is a key component of our business model 
affiliates are contractually precluded from leasing or purchasing trailers from sources other than us 
we are also focused on increased utilization of our idle trailers 
we have a relationship with a third party trailer leasing company to identify opportunities to place our trailers in service and better realize their revenue potential 
employees and independent owner operators at december   we utilized  drivers 
of this total   were independent owner operators  were affiliate drivers  and were company employee drivers 
company personnel at december   we employed personnel  approximately fewer than at december  we provide our employees with health  dental  vision  life  and other insurance coverage subject to certain premium sharing and deductible provisions 
union labor at december   we had employees and our affiliates had employees who were members of the international brotherhood of teamsters 
tractors and trailers as of december   we managed a fleet of approximately  tractors and  tank trailers 
the majority of our tanks are single compartment  chemical hauling trailers 
the balance of the fleet is made up of multi compartment trailers  dry bulk trailers  and special use equipment 
the chemical transport units typically have a capacity between  and  gallons and are designed to meet dot specifications for transporting hazardous materials 
each trailer is designed for a useful service life of to years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications 
each tractor is designed for a useful life of five to seven years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications 
we acquire new tractors for an initial utilization period of seven years 
we utilize third party repair shops for inspecting and repairing our fleets 
our systems enable us to determine when inspections and scheduled maintenance needs to be performed 

table of contents the following tables show the approximate number and age of trailers and tractors we managed as of december  tractors less than years years years greater than years total company affiliate independent owner operator total trailers less than years years years years years greater than years total company affiliate independent owner operator shipper owned total age based upon original date of manufacture  tractor trailer may be substantially refurbished or re manufactured 
risk management  insurance and safety the primary insurable risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation and cargo loss and damage which includes spills and chemical releases 
we maintain insurance against these risks and are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of the deductible under each policy 
we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage with an aggregate limit on the coverage in the amount of million  with a million per incident deductible 
qdi currently maintains a million per incident deductible for workers compensation insurance coverage 
we are insured over our deductible up to the statutory requirement by state and we are self insured for damage or loss to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
we employ personnel to perform compliance checks and conduct safety tests throughout our operations 
a number of safety programs are conducted that are designed to promote compliance with rules and regulations and to reduce accidents and cargo claims 
these programs include training programs  driver recognition programs  safety awards  driver safety meetings  distribution of safety bulletins to drivers and participation in national safety associations 
environmental matters it is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental  safety  and health laws 
we also are committed to the principles of responsible care  an international chemical industry initiative to enhance the industry s responsible management of chemicals 
we have obtained independent certification that our management system is in place and functions according to professional standards and we continue to evaluate and continuously improve our responsible care management system performance 
our activities involve the handling  transportation and storage of bulk chemicals  both liquid and dry  many of which are classified as hazardous materials or hazardous substances 
our operations involve the generation  storage  discharge and disposal of wastes that may contain hazardous substances  the inventory and use of 
table of contents cleaning materials that may contain hazardous substances and the control and discharge of storm water from industrial sites 
in addition  we may store diesel fuel  materials containing oil and other hazardous products at our terminals 
as such  we and others who operate in our industry are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by us federal  state and local agencies as well as foreign governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  and address emissions to the air  discharge onto land or water  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
these laws change frequently and generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time  and most provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
under certain of these laws  we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of our affiliates or independent owner operators 
we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other releases of such substances 
from time to time  we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities and on the road  and  notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program  we cannot assure that such obligations will not be incurred in the future  predict with certainty the extent of future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws  or assure that such liabilities will not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
we have established reserves for remediation expenses at known contamination sites when it is probable that such efforts will be required of us and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
additional information about our reserves  our estimates underlying them and the known contamination sites may be found at note to our consolidated financial statements contained herein  commitments and contingencies environmental matters 
we have also incurred in the past  and expect to incur in the future  capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance for current and planned operations 
such expenditures are generally included in our overall capital and operating budgets and are not accounted for separately 
however  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws in conducting current and planned operations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
reserves our policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of costs for future environmental compliance and remediation may be adversely affected by such factors as changes in environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of currently unknown potential remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under the applicable statutes 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
as of december  and december   we had reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively  for all environmental matters of which the more significant are discussed below 
the balances presented include both long term and current environmental reserves 
we expect these environmental obligations to be paid over the next five years 
additions to the environmental liability reserves are classified in our consolidated statements of operations within the selling and administrative category 
property contamination liabilities we have been named as or are alleged to be a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and similar state laws at approximately sites 
at of the sites  we are one of many parties with alleged liability and are negotiating with federal  state or private parties on the scope of our obligations  if any 
at of the sites  we 
table of contents will be participating in the initial studies to determine site remediation objectives 
since our overall liability cannot be estimated at this time  we have set reserves for only the initial remedial investigation phase 
at of the sites  we have explicitly denied any liability and since there has been no subsequent demand for payment we have not established a reserve for these matters 
we have estimated future expenditures for these off site multi party environmental matters to be in the range of million to million 
at of the sites  we are the only responsible party and are in the process of conducting investigations and or remediation projects 
four of these projects relate to operations conducted by clc and its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of clc in these four sites are bridgeport  new jersey  william dick  pennsylvania  tonawanda  new york  and scary creek  west virginia 
the remaining three sites relate to investigations and potential remediation that were triggered by the new jersey industrial site remediation act isra  which requires such investigations and remediation following the sale of industrial facilities 
each of these sites is discussed in more detail below 
we have estimated future expenditures for these seven properties to be in the range of million to million 
bridgeport  new jersey qdi is required under the terms of two federal consent decrees to perform remediation at this operating truck terminal and tank wash site 
clc entered into consent orders with the us environmental protection agency usepa in may for the treatment of groundwater and in october for the removal of contamination in the wetlands 
in addition  we were required to assess the remediation of contaminated soils 
the groundwater treatment remedy negotiated with usepa calls for a treatment facility for in place treatment of groundwater contamination and a local discharge 
treatment facility construction was completed in early after various start up issues  we expect the treatment facility to begin operating in wetlands contamination has been remediated with localized restoration expected to be completed in in regard to contaminated soils  we believe that usepa is now in the process of finalizing a feasibility study for the limited areas that show contamination and warrant additional investigation or work 
we have estimated expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
william dick  pennsylvania clc entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania dep and usepa in october obligating it to provide a replacement water supply to area residents  treat contaminated groundwater  and perform remediation of contaminated soils at this former wastewater disposal site 
the replacement water supply is complete 
we completed construction of a treatment facility with local discharge for groundwater treatment in the fourth quarter of plant start up issues are on going 
the agencies have approved a contaminated soils remedy  which requires both thermal treatment of contaminated soils and treatment of residuals via soil vapor extraction 
the remedy expanded to include off site shipment of contaminated soils 
soil treatment was completed in september site sampling has been conducted and the results indicate that the soil clean up objectives have not been fully achieved 
negotiations are on going with usepa over further remedial actions that may be needed at the site 
we have estimated expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
other properties scary creek  west virginia clc received a clean up notice from the state environmental authority in august the state and we have agreed that remediation can be conducted under the state s voluntary clean up program instead of the state superfund enforcement program 
we are currently completing the originally planned remedial investigation and the additional site investigation work 
tonawanda  new york clc entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation on june  obligating it to perform soil and groundwater remediation at this former truck terminal and tank wash site 
we have completed a remedial investigation and a feasibility study 
the state issued a record of decision in may the site is currently in remedial design phase 

table of contents isra new jersey facilities we are obliged to conduct investigations and remediation at three current or former new jersey tank wash and terminal sites pursuant to the state s industrial sites remediation act  which requires such remediation following the sale of facilities after these sites are in the process of remedial investigation with projections set in contemplation of limited soil remediation expense for contaminated areas 
we have estimated future expenditures for scary creek  tonawanda and isra to be in the range of million to million 
other legal matters we are from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we believe that no such routine litigation currently pending against us  if adversely determined  would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
motor carrier regulation as a motor carrier  we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa  and the surface transportation board  or stb  both of which are units of the department of transportation dot 
the fmcsa enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations and performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration  cargo and liability insurance  extension of credit to motor carrier customers  and leasing of equipment by motor carriers from independent owner operators 
the stb has authority to resolve certain types of pricing disputes and authorize certain types of intercarrier agreements 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the tank truck industry  including testing and specifications of equipment and product handling requirements 
we may transport most types of freight to and from any point in the united states over any route selected by us 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes  including changes intended to address climate change  that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices  restricting and taxing emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes may include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  increasing control over the transportation of hazardous materials  changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period of time  mandatory onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the dot 
to a large degree  intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety and hazardous material transportation regulations that mirror federal regulations 
such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations 
dot regulations mandate drug and alcohol testing of drivers and other safety personnel 
beginning july   the fmsca  for the first time  will rate individual driver safety performance inclusive of all driver violations over year time periods under new regulations known as the comprehensive safety analysis prior to these regulations  only carriers were rated by the dot and the rating only included out of service violations and ticketed offenses associated with out of service violations 
title vi of the federal aviation administration authorization act of  generally prohibits individual states  political subdivisions thereof and combinations of states from regulating price  entry  routes or service levels of most motor carriers 
however  the states retained the right to continue to require certification of carriers  based upon two primary fitness criteria safety and insurance and retained certain other limited regulatory rights 
prior to january   we held intra state authority in several states 
since that date  we have either been grandfathered or have obtained the necessary certification to continue to operate in those states 
in states in which we were not previously authorized to operate intra state  we have obtained certificates or permits allowing us to operate 
we are subject to compliance with cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration and by the department of homeland security  including regulation by 
table of contents the new bureau of customs and border protection 
we believe that we will be able to comply with bureau of customs and border protection rules  requiring pre notification of cross border shipments  with no material effect on our operations 
we are also subject to the motor carrier laws of canada and mexico 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs and adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted

item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our business is subject to general and industry specific economic factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations and profitability 
our business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have little control  that include the availability of qualified drivers  access to the credit and capital markets  changes in regulations concerning shipment and storage of material we transport and depot  increases in fuel prices  taxes and tolls  interest rate fluctuations  excess capacity in the tank trucking industry  changes in license and regulatory fees  potential disruptions at us ports of entry  downturns in customers business cycles  and reductions in customers shipping requirements 
as a result  we may experience periods of overcapacity  declining prices  lower profit margins and less availability of cash in the future 
we have a large number of customers in the chemical processing and consumer goods industries 
if these customers experience fluctuations in their business activity due to an economic downturn  work stoppages or other industry conditions  the volume of freight transported by us or container services provided by us on behalf of those customers may decrease 
the trucking industry has experienced a slowdown due to lower demand resulting from slowing economic conditions through and we expect these weak conditions to continue in 
table of contents our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our asset based loan facility the abl facility and the indentures governing our senior notes due the senior notes and our senior subordinated pik notes due the pik notes contain covenants that limit or prohibit our ability  among other things  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  redeem  repurchase  make payments on or retire subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments  make certain loans  acquisitions  capital expenditures or investments  sell certain assets  including stock of our subsidiaries  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create or incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 
these covenants may prohibit or impair us from taking actions that we believe are best for our business 
further  under the abl facility we may be required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not meet those ratios 
in addition  covenants in our debt agreements limit our use of proceeds from our ordinary operations and from extraordinary transactions 
these limits may require us to apply proceeds in a certain manner or prohibit us from utilizing the proceeds in our operations or from prepaying or retiring indebtedness that we desire 
a failure to comply with any of the covenants contained in the abl facility or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any default  the lenders of the defaulted indebtedness will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us under the abl facility  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees  to be due immediately and terminate all commitments to extend further credit  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 
such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness 
if we were unable to repay amounts under the abl facility  the lenders under the abl facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
we have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to make required payments on our indebtedness 
at december   we had consolidated long term indebtedness and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  of million  most of which matures during the next five years 
we must make regular payments under the abl facility and our capital leases  and semi annual and quarterly interest payments under our outstanding notes 
in addition  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to make regular redemptions of our senior notes 
our senior notes and pik notes issued in the quarter ended december  carry higher rates of interest and higher cash rates of interest than the notes for which they were exchanged 
in addition  interest on amounts borrowed under our abl facility is variable and will increase as market rates of interest 
table of contents increase 
our higher interest expense may reduce our future profitability 
our future higher interest expense and future redemption obligations could have other important consequences with respect to our ability to manage our business successfully  including the following it may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations for our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with these obligations could result in an event of default  using a portion of our cash flow to make interest or redemption payments on our indebtedness will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other business activities  it increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  it limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  it may make us more vulnerable to further downturns in our business or the economy  and it limits our ability to exploit business opportunities 
our senior subordinated notes due the notes mature november  the abl facility matures june  however  the maturity date of the abl facility may be accelerated if we default on our obligations under the abl facility 
if the maturity of the abl facility is accelerated  we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to repay the abl facility or  unless conditions in the credit markets improve significantly  that we will be able to refinance the abl facility on acceptable terms  or at all 
the failure to repay or refinance the abl facility at final maturity will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  would cause substantial liquidity problems and may result in the bankruptcy of us and or our subsidiaries 
any actual or potential bankruptcy or liquidity crisis may materially harm our relationships with our customers  suppliers and affiliates 
our ability to satisfy our interest  redemption and principal payment obligations will depend upon  among other things our future financial and operating performance  which will be affected by many factors beyond our control  and our future ability to borrow under the abl facility  the availability of which depends on  among other things  our complying with the covenants in the abl facility 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  and we may not be able to draw under the abl facility  in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness or fund our operations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
if we are not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all or for sufficient proceeds  we could default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our reliance upon affiliates and independent owner operators could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
we rely heavily upon participants in our affiliate program and independent owner operators to perform the services for which we contract with our customers 
a reduction in the number of independent owner operators  
table of contents whether due to capital requirements related to the expense of obtaining  operating and maintaining equipment or for other reasons  could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 
similarly the loss of one or more affiliates could adversely affect our profitability 
contracts with affiliates are for various terms and contracts with independent owner operators may be terminated by either party on short notice 
although affiliates and independent owner operators are responsible for paying for their own equipment and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek a higher percentage of the revenue generated if we are unable to increase our rates commensurately 
a continued decline in the rates we pay to our affiliates and independent owner operators could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing affiliates and independent owner operators and attract new affiliates  independent owner operators and drivers 
disagreements with affiliates or independent owner operators as to payment or other terms  or the failure of a key affiliate to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise perform consistent with our requirements may require us to utilize alternative suppliers  in each case at potentially higher prices or with disruption of the services that we provide to our customers 
if we fail to deliver on time or if the costs of our services increase  then our profitability and customer relationships could be harmed 
although our affiliates and independent owner operators have substantial contractual obligations to us  we do not control them 
these affiliates and independent owner operators typically utilize tractors and trailers bearing our tradenames and trademarks 
to the extent that one of our affiliates or independent owner operators are subject to negative publicity  they could be confused with us and it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we are self insured and have exposure to certain claims and are subject to the insurance marketplace  all of which could affect our profitability 
the primary accident risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation claims  cargo loss and damage  and general liability claims 
we currently maintain insurance for motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers  and general liability claims 
our insurance program includes a self insured deductible of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and a million deductible for workers compensation 
in addition  we currently maintain insurance policies with a total limit of million 
the million deductible per incident could adversely affect our profitability  particularly in the event of an increase in the number or severity of incidents 
additionally  we are self insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease  for cargo losses and such self insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation 
we extend insurance coverage to our affiliates for i motor vehicle related bodily injury  ii property damage  and iii cargo loss and damage 
under this extended coverage  affiliates are responsible for only a small portion of the applicable deductibles 
we are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and we cannot assure you that the cost or availability of various types of insurance may not change dramatically in the future 
to the extent these costs cannot be passed on to our customers in increased freight rates  increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability and cash flow 

table of contents the trucking industry is subject to regulation  and changes in trucking regulations may increase costs 
as a motor carrier  we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration and the us department of transportation  and by various state  federal and provincial agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities such as operating authority  safety  hours of service  hazardous materials transportation  financial reporting and acquisitions 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment  product handling requirements and drug testing of drivers 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices  emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  including changes intended to address climate change  restrictions  taxes or other controls on emissions  increasing control over the transportation of hazardous materials  changes in the hours of service regulations  which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  onboard black box recorder devices  requirements leading to accelerated purchases of new trailers  mandatory limits on vehicle weight and size  and mandatory regulations imposed by the department of homeland security 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels and emissions  which may increase our operating costs  require capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
restrictions on emissions or other climate change laws or regulations could also affect our customers that use significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels in producing or delivering the products we carry 
we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements 
increased unionization could increase our operating costs or constrain operating flexibility 
although only approximately of our driver population  including independent owner operators and employees of affiliates  was subject to collective bargaining agreements at december   unions such as the international brotherhood of teamsters have traditionally been active in the us trucking industry 
unionized workers could disrupt our operations by strike  work stoppage or other slowdown 
in addition  our non union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past  and we could be subject to future unionization 
increased unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
our operations involve hazardous materials  which could create environmental liabilities 
our activities  particularly those relating to our handling  transporting and storage of bulk chemicals  are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by governmental authorities in the united states as well as foreign governmental authorities 
among other things  these environmental laws and regulations address emissions to the air  discharges on land and in water  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and the health and safety of our employees 
these laws generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
most environmental laws provide for substantial 
table of contents fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
environmental  health and safety laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
there can be no assurance that violations of such laws  regulations  permits or licenses will not be identified or occur in the future  or that such laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could impose material costs on us 
as a handler of hazardous substances  we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other environmental releases of these substances 
we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties for chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities or over the road 
as a result of environmental studies conducted at our facilities or at third party sites  we have identified environmental contamination at certain sites that will require remediation and we are currently conducting investigation and remediation projects at seven of our facilities 
future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws are not easily predicted  and such liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business reputation 
in addition  we have been named a potentially responsible party at various sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of and other environmental regulatory programs 
our current reserves provided for these sites may prove insufficient  which would result in future charges against earnings 
further  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites could be material 
potential disruptions at us ports of entry could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption of the delivery of iso tank containers to those ports where we do business would reduce the number of iso tank containers that we transport  store  clean or maintain 
this reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela  and elsewhere  as well as hurricanes and other weather related events  and current and future market based cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions control mechanisms  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have recovered the majority of the increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected may not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
to the extent fuel surcharges are insufficient to offset our fuel costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
loss of qualified drivers or other personnel could limit our growth and negatively affect operations 
during periods of high trucking volumes  there is substantial competition for qualified drivers in the trucking industry 
furthermore  certain geographic areas have a greater shortage of qualified drivers than other areas 
we operate in many of the geographic areas where there have been driver shortages in the past and have turned down new business opportunities as a result of the lack of qualified new drivers 
difficulty in attracting qualified personnel  particularly qualified drivers  could require us to increase driver compensation  forego available customer opportunities and underutilize the tractors and trailers in our network 
these actions could result in increased costs and decreased revenues 
in addition  we may not be able to recruit other qualified personnel in the future 

table of contents the loss of one or more significant customers may adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon a limited number of large customers 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues during the loss of one or more of our other major customers  or a material reduction in services performed for such customers  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business may be harmed by terrorist attacks  future wars or anti terrorism measures 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   federal  state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses 
such existing measures and future measures may have significant costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear 
moreover  large trucks carrying toxic chemicals are a potential terrorist target  and we may be obligated to take measures  including possible capital expenditures intended to protect our trucks 
in addition  the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could continue to increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future 
we depend on members of our senior management 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team 
if members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business or financial results could be adversely affected 
our long lived assets are subject to potential asset impairment 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or approximately of our total assets and approximately of our non current assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
in addition  net property and equipment totaled approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we review for potential goodwill impairment on an annual basis as part of our goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter of each year with a measurement date of june  and more often if a triggering event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated there was goodwill impairment 
as a result of the analysis  we concluded that a total impairment charge to goodwill of million was necessary at june   of which million was related to our trucking segment  eliminating of the carrying amount of goodwill  and million was related to our container services segment 
if there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values  if management s estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly  and could result in future impairment charges  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our restructuring involves risks to our business operations and may not reduce our costs 
during and  we eliminated non driver positions  consolidated and closed under performing company terminals  implemented certain contract terminations  transitioned company owned terminals to affiliates and took other measures intended to reduce future costs 
these steps have placed  and will continue to place  pressures on our management  administrative and operational infrastructure as well as on our results of operations 
employees that departed in connection with the restructuring possessed knowledge of our business  skills and relationships with our customers  affiliates  drivers and other employees that were not replaced 
as a result  our remaining employees may be required to serve new operational roles in which they have limited experience  which may reduce employee satisfaction and productivity 
new relationships may also reduce customer  affiliate or driver satisfaction 
additionally  our restructuring plans and related efforts may divert management s and other employee s attention from other business concerns 
due to the restructuring  we took pre tax charges in and  which represent severance related costs and costs associated with lease and contract terminations 
the majority of these costs were cash expenditures paid during and or costs that we expect to pay in the future 
actual costs may exceed our estimates  and we expect to take additional charges in furthermore  we have formulated this restructuring plan with the goal of reducing our future operating expenses 
our future operating expenses may not be reduced as we expect  or reductions may be offset in the future by other expenses 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
interests of apollo may conflict with your interests 
at march   apollo and its affiliated funds owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  apollo can influence substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as acquisitions and the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer 
the interests of apollo may conflict with your interests 
for example  if we encounter financial difficulties  or are unable to pay our debts as they mature  apollo may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions  divestitures  financings or other transactions that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment  even though these transactions might involve risk to our shareholders or debt holders 
similarly  if our financial performance and creditworthiness significantly improve in the future  apollo may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings  or other transactions that could increase our leverage or impair our creditworthiness or otherwise  in their judgment  enhance apollo s equity investment in qdi  even though these transactions might involve risk to our shareholders or debt holders 
risks related to our common stock we have a majority shareholder who can substantially influence the outcome of all matters voted upon by our shareholders and prevent actions which a shareholder may otherwise view favorably 
as of march   apollo and its affiliated funds owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  apollo can influence substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as acquisitions  the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer and any other matter requiring a vote of shareholders 
this concentration of ownership could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination which a shareholder  may otherwise view favorably 

table of contents our ability to issue blank check preferred stock and florida law may prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and florida law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to control a takeover attempt which the board viewed unfavorably  elimination of the voting rights of shareholders with respect to shares that are acquired without prior board approval that would otherwise entitle such shareholder to exercise certain amounts of voting power in the election of directors  and prohibition on business combinations with interested shareholders unless particular conditions are met 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
future sales and issuances of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and result in dilution 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   there are approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
approximately million shares of common stock are restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act of or are held by affiliates 
in addition  as of march   we have million shares of common stock available for issuance under our stock option plan 
as of march   there were outstanding options for million shares and warrants for million shares of our common stock 
exercise of the warrants and of options that are in the money will result in dilution to existing shareholders in an amount equal to the difference in the market and exercise prices multiplied by the number of shares exercised 
in addition  prior to their exercise  these options and warrants may depress the market price for our common stock

the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest chemical bulk tank truck network in north america through our wholly owned subsidiary qci and are a leading provider of iso international organization for standardization container and depot services through our wholly owned subsidiary boasso 
the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of liquid and dry bulk chemicals including plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we primarily transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with logistics and other value added services 
we are a core carrier for many of the major companies engaged in chemical processing including basf  dow  dupont  exxonmobil  georgia pacific  honeywell  procter gamble  rohm haas  sunoco and unilever  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with united states operations 
our transportation revenue is a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  prices  the average number of miles driven per load  our market share and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products is  in turn  affected by many other industries and end use markets  including consumer and industrial products  paints and coatings  paper and packaging  agriculture and food products  and tends to vary with changing economic conditions 
due to the nature of our customers business  our revenues generally decline during winter months  namely the first and fourth fiscal quarters and over holidays 
highway transportation can be adversely affected depending upon the severity of the weather in various sections of the country during the winter months 
our operating expenses also are somewhat higher in the winter months  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency  increased utility costs and increased maintenance costs of equipment in colder months 
boasso is the leading north american provider of iso tank container transportation and depot services with eight terminals located in the eastern half of the united states 
in addition to intermodal iso tank transportation services  boasso provides tank cleaning  heating  testing  maintenance and storage services to customers 
boasso provides local and over the road trucking primarily within the proximity of the port cities where its depots are located and also sells equipment that its customers use for portable alternative storage or office space 
demand for iso tank containers is impacted by the volume of imports and exports of chemicals through united states ports 
boasso s revenues are accordingly impacted by this import export volume in particular the number of shipments through ports at which boasso has terminals  the volume of rail shipments to and from ports at which boasso has terminals and by boasso s market share 
economic conditions and differences among the laws and currencies of nations may impact the volume of shipments as well 
our bulk service network consists primarily of independently owned third party affiliate terminals  company operated terminals and independent owner operator drivers 
affiliates are independent companies we contract with to operate trucking terminals exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the affiliates provide the capital necessary to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
independent owner operators are generally individual drivers 
table of contents who own or lease their tractors and agree to provide transportation services to us under contract 
we believe the use of affiliates and independent owner operators provides the following key competitive advantages to us in the marketplace locally owned and operated affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
affiliates and independent owner operators generally are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue collected on each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that mitigates against cyclical downturns 
reliance on affiliates and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model that generally reduces our capital investment 
in the first quarter of  we began consolidating certain company operated terminals and transitioning other company operated terminals to affiliates 
these actions continued throughout and have resulted in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by affiliates and a substantial reduction in the number of terminals in our network 
we believe these actions will reduce certain fixed costs  provide a more variable cost structure and position us with a financially flexible business platform 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i obtain additional business from existing customers  ii add new customers  iii improve the utilization of our trailer fleet and iv add and retain qualified drivers 
while many of our customers source some of their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistics needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 
on october   we received approximately million of our notes in exchange for new senior notes 
we also received approximately million for our notes in exchange for approximately million aggregate principal amount of our new pik notes  approximately million warrants and million in cash 
the warrants are exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  during the period beginning april  and ending on november  acquisitions and dispositions during  we did not complete any asset or other acquisitions of businesses or affiliates 
on october   we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our tank wash subsidiary  qsi  for million  of which million was paid in cash and the remaining million in a subordinated note 
the subordinated note is a five year non amortizing note which matures on december  the principal is payable in a lump sum at maturity 
interest is payable quarterly at per annum commencing december  in connection with the sale  qsi entered into various agreements with the purchaser  which is not affiliated with us  including long term leases of real estate used in the tank wash business and various operating agreements 
the assets sold had a net book value of million which included million of equipment  million of inventory  and million of intangibles 
the sold qsi business generated approximately million of revenue in from tank wash and related operations 
we recorded a pre tax gain the fourth quarter of million 
during  we purchased the assets of two transportation companies and the assets of an affiliate for million  in the aggregate  of which million was paid in cash at closing and the remaining million is payable over future periods 
of the total million  we allocated million to property and equipment  million to goodwill  and million to other intangible assets such as non compete agreements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
the asset lives used are presented in the following table average lives in years buildings and improvements tractors and terminal equipment trailers furniture and fixtures other equipment tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service 
any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales or disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the second quarter with a measurement date of june  and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with the fasb guidance 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by determining the fair value based on criteria in the fasb guidance for each reporting unit  our trucking segment and our container services segment 
these reporting units contain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of previous business acquisitions 
as a result of our annual impairment test conducted as of june   we concluded a total impairment charge of million was necessary  of which million of goodwill was related to our trucking segment  eliminating of the carrying amount of goodwill of that segment  million was related to our container services segment and million was related to the tradename of our container services segment 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million associated with the impairment charge 
the impairment charge related to both deductible and nondeductible tax goodwill 
the impairment would have normally resulted in a tax benefit of million  but this was offset by million of tax expense related to 
table of contents the nondeductible portion of the goodwill 
additionally  the recording of this impairment charge caused an increase to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we no longer believe are more likely than not to be realized 
the increase to the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to tax expense of million 
the increase to the valuation allowance was triggered by the impairment charge 
we have evaluated at least quarterly whether indicators of impairment exist in accordance with applicable guidance 
prior to our june  analysis  we did not believe that factors attributable to the economic downturn would impact the recoverability of our goodwill 
our performance since the prior period s goodwill impairment test at june  through year end trended positive and there were no indications from our quarterly reviews that a triggering event had occurred 
the first quarter of showed improved operating income year over year and strong operating cash flow  however  due to the continuing economic downturn  we reviewed not only our market capitalization  but also performed a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions adjusted to reflect the current economic environment and which we believed to be appropriate at the time 
the conclusions from our extended analysis at march  did not indicate a trend in operating results that would foretell of impairment to our goodwill 
for our june  analysis  we adjusted further our assumptions used  such as growth and discount rates  in the annual impairment test to reflect the persistence of the downward economic trend 
we continued to evaluate indicators of impairment quarterly following our annual goodwill impairment test at june  through year end  including the quarter ended december  there were no indications that a triggering event had occurred as of december  as of december   we had total goodwill of million  all of which was allocated to container services 
goodwill under the fasb guidance  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in the first step  we determine whether there is an indication of impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if  based on the first step  we determine that there is an indication of goodwill impairment  we assess the impairment in step two in accordance with the fasb guidance 
in the first step  we determine the fair value for our reporting units using a combination of two valuation approaches the market approach and the income approach 
the market approach uses a guideline company methodology which is based upon a comparison of us to similar publicly traded companies within our industry 
we derive a market value of invested capital or business enterprise value for each comparable company by multiplying the price per share of common stock of the publicly traded companies by their total common shares outstanding and adding each company s current level of debt 
we calculate a business enterprise multiple based on revenue and earnings from each company then apply those multiples to each reporting unit s revenue and earnings to conclude a reporting unit business enterprise value 
assumptions regarding the selection of comparable companies are made based on  among other factors  capital structure  operating environment and industry 
as the comparable companies were typically larger and more diversified than our reporting units  multiples were adjusted prior to application to our reporting units revenues and earnings to reflect differences in margins  long term growth prospects and market capitalization 
the income approach uses a discounted debt free cash flow analysis to measure fair value by estimating the present value of future economic benefits 
to perform the discounted debt free cash flow analysis  we develop a pro forma analysis of each reporting unit to estimate future available debt free cash flow and discounting estimated debt free cash flow by an estimated industry weighted average cost of capital based on the same comparable companies used in the market approach 
per the fasb guidance  the weighted average cost of capital is based on inputs eg  capital structure  risk  etc 
from a market participant s perspective and not necessarily from the reporting unit or qdi s perspective 
future cash flow is projected based on assumptions for our economic growth  industry expansion  future operations and the discount rate  all of which require significant judgments by management 

table of contents after computing a separate business enterprise value under the income approach and market approach  we apply a weighting to them to derive the business enterprise value of the reporting unit 
the income approach and market approach were both weighted in the analysis performed at june  the weightings are evaluated each time a goodwill impairment assessment is performed and give consideration to the relative reliability of each approach at that time 
given that the business enterprise value derived from the market approach supported what was calculated in the income approach  we believed that both approaches should be equally weighted 
based on these weightings we concluded a business enterprise value for each reporting unit 
we then add debt free liabilities of the reporting unit to the concluded business enterprise value to derive an implied fair value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value is compared to the reporting unit s carrying value of total assets 
upon completion of the analysis in step one  we determined that the carrying amount of our trucking reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the carrying amount of our container services reporting unit was nearly breakeven with its fair value  requiring a step two analysis to be performed for both reporting units 
in step two of the goodwill impairment test  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
this involves testing the definite lived assets in accordance with the fasb guidance using undiscounted cash flows 
then a fair value allocation is performed in accordance with the fasb guidance for each reporting unit based on the business enterprise value obtained in step one 
from that we determine the actual goodwill impairment for each reporting unit based on the goodwill residual amount 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
upon completion of step two of the analysis  an impairment charge was determined related to our trucking and container services segments 
intangible assets to determine the implied fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method  pursuant to which those assets are valued by reference to the amount of royalty income they would generate if licensed in an arm s length transaction 
under the relief from royalty method  similar to the discounted cash flow method  estimated net revenues expected to be generated by the asset during its life are multiplied by a benchmark royalty rate and then discounted by the estimated weighted average cost of capital associated with the asset 
the resulting capitalized royalty stream is an indication of the value of owning the asset 
based upon management s review of the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets in our container services segment  we determined that the carrying value of the boasso tradename exceeded its implied fair value by million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our container services segment 
the methodology applied in the analysis performed at june  was consistent with the methodology applied in prior years  but was based on updated assumptions  as appropriate 
as a result of the downturn in the economic environment during and  determining the fair value of the individual reporting units required more judgment on the part of management than in the past 
given the continued recessionary conditions in our industry  estimates of future cash flows used in the analysis performed at june  were lower than those used in the prior year analysis 
in addition  our weighted average cost of capital used in the analysis at june  was higher than that used in due to an increase in the reporting unit risk premium coupled with the market driven inputs to weighted average cost of capital 
the discount rates utilized in the analysis also reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of individual reporting units and were increased from the prior year analysis to reflect increased risk due to current volatility in the economic environment 
if there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values  if management s estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other 
table of contents significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values for each reporting unit and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly  and could result in future impairment charges  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax asset in accordance with fasb guidance  we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded or released against our deferred tax assets 
we continue to evaluate quarterly the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets 
the company reviews a rolling thirty six month calculation of us earnings to determine if we are in a cumulative loss position 
during the second quarter of  an impairment charge of million was recorded  and as a result of this charge  we determined that we were in a cumulative loss position 
based on this negative evidence we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset was realizable 
for purposes of assessing realizability of the deferred tax assets  this cumulative financial reporting loss position is considered significant negative evidence that we will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
as a result  a million deferred tax valuation allowance was recorded 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  operating results or other factors 
if any of these factors and related estimates change in the future  it may increase or decrease the valuation allowance and related income tax expense in the same period at december  we had an estimated million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  million in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million in foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through  while the alternative minimum tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely and the foreign tax credits may be carried forward for years 
uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb guidance  we account for uncertainty in income taxes  using a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition and measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit and or an additional charge to the tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was million in as compared to million in the effective rate for was negative  which is lower than our normalized tax rate of  in large part due to the recording of a deferred tax valuation allowance and an impairment charge 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 

table of contents accrued loss and damage claims we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  independent owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after march  prior to march   our insurance deductible was million per incident for bodily injury and property damage 
as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
as of december   we had million in an outstanding letter of credit to our insurance administrator to guarantee the self insurance portion of our liability 
if we fail to meet certain terms of our agreement  the insurance administrator may draw down the letter of credit 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenue  including fuel surcharges  and related costs are recognized on the date freight is delivered 
other service revenue consists primarily of rental revenues  container revenues and tank wash revenues 
rental revenues from affiliates  independent owner operators and third parties are recognized ratably over the lease period 
container revenues  consisting primarily of repair and storage services  are recognized when the services are rendered 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is completed 
service revenues on insurance policies are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
we recognize all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted with our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to independent owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
stock compensation plans stock compensation is determined by the assumptions required under the fasb guidance 
the fair values of stock option grants are based upon the black scholes option pricing model and amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
restricted stock awards are issued and measured at market value on the date of grant and related compensation expense is recognized over time on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was million and million  respectively  for fiscal year as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock based awards 
the recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost generally varies from two to four years 
for further discussion on stock based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 

table of contents material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
we had an accumulated net pension equity credit after tax of million at december  compared to a charge of million at december  the equity charge in reflected the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is million 
a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to million 
a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to million 
restructuring we account for restructuring costs associated with one time termination benefits  costs associated with lease and contract terminations and other related exit activities in accordance with the fasb s guidance 
we have made estimates of the costs to be incurred as part of our restructuring plan 
during the quarter ended june   we committed to a plan of restructure resulting in the termination of non driver positions and the consolidation  closure and affiliation of underperforming company terminals 
we continued our plan of restructure throughout which resulted in a restructuring charge of million  of which the majority related to our trucking segment 
our restructuring plan continued in and resulted in charges of million  of which the majority related to our trucking segment 
the charges in and related to employee termination benefits and other related exit activities  and included the termination of approximately non driver positions 
we expect to conclude our restructuring plan in and to take additional related charges during the year

segment operating results we have two reportable business segments for financial reporting purposes that are distinguished primarily on the basis of services offered trucking  which consists of truckload transportation of bulk chemicals  and container services  specifically iso tank container transportation and depot services 
segment revenues and operating income include the allocation of fuel surcharge to the trucking and container services segments 
the operating income reported in our segments excludes amounts reported in other operating income  such as gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment  restructuring costs  impairment charge  corporate and other unallocated amounts 
corporate and unallocated amounts include depreciation and amortization and other gains and losses 
although these amounts are excluded from the business segment results  they are included in reported consolidated earnings

exchange rates we operate in canada and mexico as well as in the united states 
our results of operations are affected by the relative strength of currencies in the countries where we operate 
approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively  was generated outside the united states 
in comparing the average exchange rates between and  the canadian dollar depreciated against the united states dollar by approximately while the mexican peso appreciated against the united states dollar by approximately 
the change in exchange rates negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in the depreciation of the canadian dollar was the primary reason for the million net increase in cumulative currency translation loss in shareholders deficit for gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of operations from foreign currency transactions included a million gain in  a million gain in  and a million gain in risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations are discussed further in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that our liquidity  asset light business model  and streamlined operations will enable us to weather a continued economic downturn in while providing us with the flexibility to benefit from economic improvement 
although miles driven were approximately lower than in  we still generated positive cash flow from operations 
additionally  at december   we had million of borrowing availability under our asset based loan facility the abl facility 
the following summarizes our cash flows for fiscal years  and as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rates net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of period cash at end of period historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under our abl facility 
our primary cash needs consist of working capital  capital expenditures and debt service including our abl facility and our notes 
we incur capital expenditures for the purpose of purchasing tractors and trailers to meet our strategic needs during the year  and maintaining and improving our infrastructure 
we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million  although the actual amount of capital expenditures could differ materially because of operating needs  regulatory changes  covenants in our debt arrangements  other expenses  including interest expense  or other factors

we expect to fund payment of the maturing notes and redemption obligations under our senior notes through cash from operations 
we expect to fund any cash needs for our operations during this period from borrowings under our abl facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the first quarter of  we purchased an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we believe that these purchases at a substantial discount to their principal amount were a good investment for us because the prices were substantially less than the amount that we would owe for the repurchased notes upon maturity  and we had adequate liquidity for such purchases 
as described above  on october   we completed exchange and tender offers for our notes and our notes 
in connection with the exchange and tender offers  we received approximately million of our notes in exchange for million of our new senior notes 
we received approximately million of our notes in exchange for approximately million aggregate principal amount of our new pik notes  approximately million warrants to purchase our common stock and million in cash 
we have accrued million for environmental claims and million for loss and damage claims and the timing of the cash payment for such claims fluctuates from quarter to quarter 

table of contents we generated million  million and million in net cash from operating activities in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily due to increased collections of outstanding accounts receivable  lower loss and damage claim payments and lower operating expenses due to our restructuring and transition to affiliates or closure of many of our trucking terminals 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily due to our net income for the year 
we continued to experience softness in demand throughout  however our continued restructuring and cost reduction efforts have enabled us to generate stronger operating cash 
we have aligned our cost structure to allow for flat or declining revenues 
the cash required to pay in on our higher rate senior notes and pik notes will be mitigated in part because interest equal to payable on the pik notes is payable through the issuance of additional notes rather than cash

liquidity we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the abl facility  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including obligations under our credit agreement  and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond twelve months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the abl facility are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we would be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations  or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  or were not permitted under any of our debt agreements and we default on our obligations  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness 
other issues while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and other regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 
the abl facility and the indentures governing our senior notes and our pik notes contain certain limitations on qd llc s ability to make distributions to qdi 
we do not consider these restrictions to be significant  because qdi is a holding company with no significant operations or assets  other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units 
qd llc s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries are generally permitted to make distributions to qd llc  which is the principal obligor under the abl facility  the notes  the notes  the senior notes and the pik notes

while the restrictions in our abl facility cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the abl facility and the indentures governing our senior notes and our pik notes may not afford the holders of our debt protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through our variable rate borrowings under the abl facility and the notes 
with regard to the abl facility at qd llc s option  the applicable margin for borrowings under the current asset tranche at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the fixed asset tranche at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for such borrowings will be reduced or increased based on aggregate borrowing base availability under the abl facility over the life of the abl facility

the base rate for our notes is libor plus 
balance at december  interest rate at december  effect of increase in s in s abl facility senior floating rate notes  due total at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate for each would result in million of additional interest expense during the next year 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous one percentage point increase in the rates of all of our indebtedness and that the principal amount of each is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness are based  our various options to elect the lower of two different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
we reduced our exposure to variable borrowings on october   when we exchanged substantially all of our floating rate notes for our fixed rate senior notes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 

table of contents these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for were negatively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the united states dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have increased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges can be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel costs were covered through fuel surcharges
