item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading  less than truckload ltl  non union motor carrier providing regional  inter regional and national ltl service and value added logistics services from a single integrated organization 
we operate as one business segment and offer our products and services through our four branded product groups od domestic  od expedited  od global and od technology 
in addition to our ltl services  we offer our 
table of contents customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation  supply chain consulting  transportation management  truckload brokerage  container delivery and warehousing services 
through marketing and carrier relationships  we also offer door to door international freight services to and from all of north america  central america  south america and the far east 
more than of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics revenue per hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges  revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement 
revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  however  we believe including this deferred revenue in our revenue per hundredweight measurements results in a better indicator of changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments 
weight per shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers  as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
beginning in  however  many shippers began consolidating shipments in an effort to reduce the impact of the high cost of diesel fuel on their transportation costs 
in doing so  these shippers caused an increase in our weight per shipment by shipping the same volume of goods with fewer shipments 
we believe this trend continued in  despite the subsequent overall decline in diesel fuel costs  due to the overall weak demand for shippers goods resulting from the recessionary economy 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by analyzing this metric  we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets 
revenue per shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of shipments we receive  to calculate total revenue  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increasing density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour  platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour 
in addition to our focus on density  it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle 
we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability 
we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  operating supplies and expenses  which includes fuel and repair parts  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 

table of contents we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network  increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes

table of contents our financial results for reflect our operating strengths as we remained profitable despite a significant decline in tonnage and revenue  which resulted from the negative impacts of a recessionary economy and an increasingly competitive operating environment within the ltl industry 
the persistent recessionary economy caused freight demand to weaken throughout when combined with the overcapacity in the ltl industry  the weakened demand created an aggressive and competitive pricing environment 
confronted with this environment and an decline in tonnage  we focused on delivering outstanding service performance  improving the productivity of our employees  managing our variable costs and remaining disciplined with the pricing for our services 
despite the success we had with these measures  we were unable to sufficiently increase our prices or generate enough cost savings to offset our decline in revenue 
as a result  our operating ratio increased to in from in and our earnings per diluted share decreased to for we believe our strategy mitigated much of the negative impact that we could have experienced as a result of the extremely difficult ltl operating environment  since our operating ratio deteriorated by only basis points despite a decline in revenue 
revenue the decrease in revenue during was the result of decreases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of and  respectively 
the reduction in tonnage during resulted from a decrease in the number of shipments that was partially offset by a increase in weight per shipment 
the tonnage decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the recessionary economy on freight demand  since our research indicates there has been no significant change in our market share 
although certain economic metrics indicate improvement and small amounts of capacity have exited the market  we do not anticipate a change in industry conditions until there is a sustained recovery in the general domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity resulting from potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry 
until one or both of these events occur  we could experience additional declines in our tonnage and shipments as well as continued pressure on our yields 
however  we believe we have positioned ourselves well  through our commitment to service  to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent  claims free and value driven service once industry conditions improve 
revenue per hundredweight decreased to from in this decrease in our revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to the reduction in fuel surcharge revenue  which resulted from a significant decline in the average price of diesel fuel between the comparable years 
excluding fuel surcharges  revenue per hundredweight remained consistent at for and we were unable to sufficiently increase our overall pricing during due to the competitive pricing environment in the ltl industry 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  pricing emerged as the principal driver of competition as many carriers attempted to either gain market share or minimize tonnage losses through price discounting 
despite the pricing pressure  we remained committed to our pricing philosophy of charging our customers a fair and reasonable price for outstanding service 
our commitment to service is evidenced by an approximate on time service performance and a historically low cargo claims ratio during the prolonged impact of overcapacity in the industry and the aggressive competition on prices could continue to impact our ability to increase or even maintain our pricing in future periods  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and net income 
fuel surcharge revenue decreased to of revenue from of revenue in most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers  although it is generally believed to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products that we use 
we continuously monitor the components of our pricing  including base freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

table of contents operating costs and other expenses salaries  wages and benefits increased to of revenue in from in the increase as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the year over year decline in fuel surcharge revenue  which has no corresponding decrease in the volume of freight moving through our network 
as a result  driver wages increased to of revenue from in platform wages as a percentage of revenue increased to from in while our salaries  wages and benefits increased as a percent of revenue  the million overall decrease is attributable to the year over year reduction in the total number of full time employees  the decline in the number of hours worked and the overall increased productivity of our employees 
our p d shipments per hour increased and p d stops per hour increased  both reflecting the improved efficiencies and utilization of our experienced drivers 
our linehaul laden load average increased 
platform pounds handled per hour increased  which allowed our platform wages to remain consistent as a percent of revenue 
these productivity improvements partially offset the impact on our operating ratio of the annual wage increase provided to our driver and platform employees in september as well as the scheduled increases newly hired employees achieved in as they gained experience 
employee benefit costs increased to of salaries and wages in from in these increases are primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our group health and dental coverage and workers compensation claims experience 
group health and dental costs rose to of total salary and wages in from in due to an increase in the average cost of medical claims per employee  as well as an increase in the number of claims paid for participants who elected coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra 
legislation passed in lengthened the period of coverage for eligible cobra participants who were involuntarily terminated between september  and february  operating supplies and expenses decreased to of revenue in from in this decrease is primarily due to the decline in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs decreased during the year as a result of the combined effect of a decrease in our average price per gallon and a decrease in gallons consumed 
the reduction in fuel consumption is primarily due to the year over year decline in overall miles  as well as a increase in our miles per gallon 
the decreased consumption also lowered our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the million reduction in operating taxes and licenses 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
general supplies and expenses remained consistent as a percent of revenue at for both and these costs remained consistent as a percent of revenue due to our strict cost control measures put in place to manage our variable costs and the decrease in supplies directly related to lower shipment volumes 
the decrease in insurance and claims expense to of revenue from in is attributable to the and decreases in auto liability and cargo claims expenses  respectively 
we self insure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels 
the decrease in our auto liability expenses was primarily due to a million favorable adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter that resulted from improved experience in the number of claims during and a reduction in our estimate for losses in prior years 
we believe that our cargo claims expense improved primarily due to the increased training of our employees on claims prevention  which resulted in a historically low cargo claims ratio in and a decrease in total claims paid 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to of revenue in as compared to in the increase as a percent of revenue reflects the combined impact of the decline in overall revenue in on these fixed costs and our significant investments in real estate and revenue equipment in and 
table of contents consistent with our long term growth strategy  we took advantage of real estate opportunities during  which allowed us not only to expand our service center network  but also to relocate certain operations to larger facilities 
in addition  we made a strategic decision to purchase new revenue equipment in  while retaining the tractors and trailers scheduled to be replaced 
our decision to increase our equipment capacity placed us in a position to accommodate an increase in demand for our services that could have resulted from business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry that we believed were likely to result from the recessionary economy 
other expense  net includes the net investment gains or losses on the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
the cash value of these contracts was impacted by the improvement in equity markets during  which favorably affected comparisons with our effective tax rate for and was 
our effective tax rates in and were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations 
these fuel tax credits expired on december  and  unless extended by future legislation  will likely increase our effective tax rate in our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items

revenue per hundredweight revenue per shipment average length of haul miles we remained true to our long term strategy in by providing consistent on time service  maintaining price discipline and driving additional operating efficiencies into our processes  despite one of the most challenging operating environments we have ever experienced 
we were faced with record high fuel prices in the first half of  which contributed to the overall increase in our operating expenses 
as fuel prices began to decline  the domestic economy slipped into a recession causing significant and further declines in tonnage for the industry 
as a result  pricing emerged as a primary driver of competition 
while we maintained a commitment to our pricing philosophy and achieved productivity improvements  these factors were not sufficient to overcome our increased operating expenses and the negative impact of the recessionary economy 
as a result  our earnings per diluted share decreased to for and our operating ratio increased basis points to 
we believe our strategy of providing high service levels  maintaining price discipline and aggressively managing costs proved to be the best course of action in the ltl marketplace in and minimized much of the negative impact on our financial performance caused by increased competition and the downward spiral of the economy 
despite the challenges in  our revenue increased to billion  which was driven by a increase in total tonnage shipped and a increase in revenue per hundredweight 
the increase in tonnage shipped resulted from a increase in weight per shipment that was partially offset by a decrease in the number of shipments 
while an increase in weight per shipment is generally an indication of an 
table of contents improving economy  we believe the increase in was more attributable to changes in customer shipping patterns as transportation costs increased 
we believe shippers were increasingly consolidating their shipments into larger units to ship less frequently at lower costs per hundredweight 
our mix of freight in reflects growth in truckload shipments  spot quotes and container shipments  all of which have an average higher weight per shipment 
we attribute our growth in tonnage primarily to increases in market share in our existing areas of operations 
while we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december   over of our revenue was produced from service centers open for more than one year 
although we experienced an overall increase in tonnage for  freight demand weakened throughout the second half of the year and our tonnage declined during the fourth quarter 
we believe that freight demand in the ltl industry will not improve until there is a general recovery in the domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity 
as a result  we experienced additional declines in our shipments and tonnage in revenue per hundredweight increased to from in revenue per hundredweight for reflects the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs implemented on february   as well as an increase in fuel surcharge revenue that resulted from the increase in the average price of diesel fuel during the year 
excluding fuel surcharges  revenue per hundredweight decreased in our revenue per hundredweight was also negatively impacted by the increase in weight per shipment as well as the decline in the average length of haul 
the pricing environment in the ltl industry was extremely competitive throughout the competitiveness intensified in the second half of the year as the historical seasonal increase in freight volumes did not materialize 
as a result  many carriers in our industry reduced their prices in an attempt to minimize declines in tonnage and shipment volumes 
although we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network  we did so while maintaining our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services 
we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing by keeping our service at superior levels  thus creating additional value to our customers 
we believe our rational and measured approach to the current pricing environment will be in our best long term interest 
however  a prolonged recession and competitive forces may result in some short term erosion in our pricing and shipment volumes  which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and net income 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue from in most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers

salaries  wages and benefits decreased to of revenue in from in while we were able to improve the productivity of our linehaul  p d and platform operations  the decrease  as a percent of revenue  primarily resulted from the overall increase in revenue 
the productivity improvements  however  helped minimize the impact of the annual general wage increase provided to our workforce in september and and the deleveraging effect of the fourth quarter decline in tonnage 
driver wages decreased to of revenue in from in we were able to effectively match our labor with the changes in shipment volume during the year while also improving our productivity 
in our linehaul operations  we increased our laden load average

table of contents hour increased and  respectively 
platform wages decreased to of revenue from in platform pounds handled per hour increased  primarily as a result of the increase in weight per shipment 
employee benefit costs increased to of salaries and wages in from in the increase is attributable to rising group health and dental costs  which increased to of total salary and wages in from  and increased costs associated with our paid time off for employees 
we experienced an increase in the severity of our health claims in  which resulted in a increase in claim payments as compared to operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase is primarily due to the significant rise in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs increased during the year as a result of a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel and  to a lesser extent  a increase in gallons consumed 
we were able to minimize our consumption of fuel in by implementing several initiatives designed to improve our miles per gallon 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
depreciation and amortization remained consistent at of revenue for both and we continued to make significant investments in our service center network and revenue equipment in we purchased eleven service centers and also completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to increase the overall capacity of our service center network 
we reduced our capital expenditures for revenue equipment in as compared to our purchases in recent years to appropriately match our fleet size with freight demands 
we also incurred an increase in building and office equipment rents to of revenue from for  due to an increase in both the number and size of leased facilities 
other expense  net increased to of revenue from of revenue in the increase reflects the decline in the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to company s non qualified deferred compensation plans 
the cash value of these contracts was unfavorably impacted by the decline in equity markets during our effective tax rate for was compared to in our effective tax rate was lower in as a result of the favorable impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in and  to a lesser extent  the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available 
our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items 
liquidity and capital resources a summary of our cash flows is presented below in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year 
table of contents we have two primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which is described below 
we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide another source of liquidity  if needed 
to facilitate our access to the equity market  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec during the fourth quarter of that provides us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices from time to time 
at december   cash and short term investments decreased to million from million at december   primarily due to the liquidation of million held in money market funds and short term investments to help fund our capital expenditures during capital expenditures the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other less proceeds from sale total our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the expansion in the number and size of service center facilities to support our plan for long term growth  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted revenue growth 
despite weak economic conditions in  we continued the planned expansion of our service center network and took advantage of favorable real estate opportunities that support our long term growth objectives 
we also made a strategic decision to execute our normal equipment replacement cycle while retaining tractors scheduled to be replaced 
by increasing our fleet and service center capacity during  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of any increase in demand for our services caused by improvements in the economy  potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry 
while our purchase of additional equipment in increased our depreciation expenses during the year  it should  in turn  result in reduced capital expenditures for equipment in we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
at this time  we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations 
however  any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in  we invested million in the purchase of property and equipment 
cash flows from operations and the liquidation of million held in money market funds and short term investments at december  funded approximately of our capital expenditures in the remainder of these expenditures was funded through the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in and were significantly higher than because in  we were able to effectively utilize our existing fleet to meet our freight demands 
as a result  our purchases in were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle 
in and  however  we both replaced equipment and increased capacity to support our anticipated growth and geographic expansion 

table of contents we currently project capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions  to be approximately million for the year ending december  of our capital expenditures  approximately million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  approximately million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers to replace equipment at the end of its useful life  and approximately million is allocated for investments in technology 
we expect to fund a substantial majority of these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility  if necessary 
financing agreements we have a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august  the credit agreement

interest rates on these notes are fixed at and 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was and at december  and  respectively 

table of contents with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i million  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in or  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
despite current macroeconomic conditions  we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future  and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long term capital needs

critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual 
table of contents number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date 
write offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods 
as such  we do not anticipate any near term changes in our methodologies for these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bipd  workers compensation  long term disability  group health and group dental not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability  group health and group dental  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  any changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the 
table of contents leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base  which is generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
volatility in the price of diesel fuel  independent of inflation  has impacted our business  as described in this report 
however  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years
