see item a risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical technology company focused on the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders  with a focus on products that treat conditions that affect the aging spine 
our broad product portfolio and pipeline includes a variety of spinal disorder products and systems focused on solutions addressing the cervical  thoracolumbar  intervertebral  minimally invasive  vertebral compression fracture  disorders related to poor bone quality  and spinal stenosis markets 
our principal product offerings are focused on the global market for orthopedic spinal disorder solution products  which is estimated to be more than billion in revenue in and is expected to grow between over the next year 
our surgeons culture emphasizes collaboration with spinal surgeons to conceptualize  design and co develop a broad range of products 
we have a state of the art  in house manufacturing facility that provides us with a unique competitive advantage  and enables us to rapidly deliver solutions to meet surgeons and patients critical needs 
our products and systems are made of titanium  titanium alloy  stainless steel  cobalt chrome and a strong  heat resistant  radiolucent  biocompatible plastic called polyetheretherketone  or peek 
we also sell products made of allograft  precision milled and processed human bone that surgeons can use in place of metal and synthetic materials 
we also sell bone grafting products that are comprised of both tissue based and synthetic materials 
we believe that our products and systems have enhanced features and benefits that make them attractive to surgeons and that our broad portfolio of products and systems provide a comprehensive solution for the safe and successful surgical treatment of spine disorders 
all of our implants that are sold in the us that require us food and drug administration  or fda  clearance have been cleared by the fda 
in the us our products have been used in over  and  surgeries in and  respectively 
in addition to selling our products in the us  we also sell our products in japan  the european union  south america and hong kong 
on december   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire scient x  a global medical device company based in guyancourt  france that designs  develops and manufacturers surgical implants to treat disorders of the spine 
the transaction is structured as an all stock transaction such that of outstanding scient x stock will be exchanged pursuant to a fixed ratio for  shares of our common stock 
the transaction is currently expected to close by the end of the first quarter of and is subject to the approval of our shareholders 
although our products generally are purchased by hospitals and surgical centers  orders are typically placed at the request of surgeons who then use our products in a surgical procedure 
during the years ended december  and december   no single surgeon  hospital or surgical center represented greater than of our consolidated revenues 
additionally  we sell a broad array of products  which diminishes our reliance on any single product or spine disorder 
in  as part of our strategy to focus on disorders affecting the aging spine  we began entering into license agreements with third parties that we believe enable us to rapidly develop and commercialize unique products for the treatment of spinal disorders that disproportionately affect the aging population 
through december   we licensed approximately patent and patent applications from third parties 
a discussion of our license agreements may be found in item business intellectual property included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
to assist us in evaluating our product development strategy  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the spinal implant industry 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the surgeon community and our scientific advisory board in connection with the demand for our products  
table of contents including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the spinal implant industry and the capacity requirements of our manufacturing facility 
revenue and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our revenues and expenses revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of spinal surgery implants used in the treatment of spine disorders 
spinal implant products include spine screws and complementary products  vertebral body replacement devices  plates  products to treat vertebral compression fractures and bone grafting materials 
our revenues are generated by our direct sales force and independent distributors 
our products are requested directly by surgeons and shipped and billed to hospitals or surgical centers 
in japan  where orthopedic trauma surgeons also perform spine surgeries  we have sold and expect to continue to sell orthopedic trauma products in order to introduce our spine products to japanese surgeons 
in europe  where we began sales in the second half of  we use independent distributors that purchase our products and market them to their surgeon customers 
as a result of offering payment terms greater than our customary us business terms and operating in a new market in which we have limited prior experience  revenues for sales to our european distributors have been deferred until the sooner of when payments become due or cash is received 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of direct product costs  royalties  depreciation of our surgical instruments  and the amortization of purchased intangibles 
we manufacture substantially all of the non allograft implants that we sell 
our product costs consist primarily of direct labor  manufacturing overhead  and raw materials and components 
allograft product costs include the cost of procurement and processing of human tissue

in process research and development 
ipr d consists of acquired research and development assets that were not technologically feasible on the date we acquired such technology  provided that such technology did not have any alternative future use at that date 
at the time of acquisition  we expect all acquired ipr d will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of a product will be achieved 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  and obtaining regulatory clearances 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  delays or failures during the development process  delays or failures to obtain regulatory clearances  and delays or failures due to intellectual property rights of third parties

non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
certain of these financial measures are considered non gaap financial measures within the meaning of item of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
we believe that non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with the gaap results  provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by our management to evaluate financial results and to plan and forecast future periods 
however  non gaap financial measures should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures used by us may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies  including our competitors 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss excluding the effects of interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and other non recurring income or expense items  such as in process research and development expense and transaction related expenses 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is net income loss 
adjusted ebitda has limitations 
therefore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered either in isolation of as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
furthermore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by operating  investing or financing activities  or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs

management does not consider these expenses when it makes certain evaluations of the operations of the company 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to non gaap earnings loss is net income loss

we believe such amounts and cash raised in a february equity offering see subsequent events that may impact liquidity below will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through at least december  without consideration of the acquisition of scient x as discussed below 

table of contents in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement  the credit facility  with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation  or  the lenders see credit facility and other debt below 
in conjunction with the credit facility  we are required to maintain compliance with quarterly financial covenants  which include a minimum level of revenues and a minimum level of adjusted ebitda 
the minimum covenants are consistent each quarter during fiscal in order to meet the financial covenants for  we will need to achieve growth over our historical quarterly revenue and earnings levels 
our board of directors approved operating plan shows that we would meet the quarterly financial covenants and we believe that we will be able to achieve this operating plan 
however  if we are not able to achieve our planned revenue growth or incur costs in excess of our forecast  we could be in default of the credit facility 
in addition to the financial covenants described above  there are other clauses including subjective clauses that would allow the lenders to declare the loan immediately due and payable 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
on december   we entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire all the shares of scient x  a french medical device company that is controlled by healthpointcapital who owns approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  scient x is also a spine implant manufacturing and distribution business with operations concentrated in europe 
subsequent to the closing of the acquisition  we will be responsible for managing the operations of the combined entities 
scient x currently has a credit facility requiring the achievement of a minimum revenue amount as specified in the credit facility 
while the operating plan of scient x shows that scient x will achieve those covenants  if scient x is not able to achieve its planned revenue growth  it could be in default of its credit facility 
in addition to the financial covenant  there are other clauses including subjective clauses that would allow the lenders to declare the loan immediately due and payable 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
based on our plan for combining the operating activities of these two companies  which includes a combined operating plan and cash forecast  management believes that on a combined basis  we will have sufficient working capital to fund our cash requirements through december  assuming the acquisition occurs  if either we or scient x is not able to achieve the minimum targeted revenue growth and related improvements in profitability to meet the quarterly covenants or has other unanticipated expenditures  we would be required to attempt to renegotiate the credit facility and may be required to seek additional capital and or to substantially reduce discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we may seek additional financing  which may include additional debt and or equity financing or funding through other third party agreements 
we intend to enter into a new credit facility upon the closing of the acquisition which would include financial covenants reflective of the combined operations of us and scient x 
there can be no assurance that such new credit facility or any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or available at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 
we will need to invest in working capital and capitalized surgical instruments in order to support our revenue projections through should we not be able to achieve our revenue forecast and cash consumption starts to exceed forecasted consumption  management will need to adjust our investment in surgical instruments and manage our inventory to the decreased sales volumes 
if we do not make these adjustments in a timely manner  there could be an adverse impact on our financial resources 
historically  our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products  proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt 
our principal 
table of contents uses of cash have included cash used in operations  acquisitions of businesses and intellectual property rights  payments relating to purchases of property and equipment and repayments of borrowings 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions 
we expect that  as our revenues grow  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve profitability 
in june  we entered into a subscription agreement with one of our existing shareholders  healthpointcapital partners ii  lp we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we paid approximately million for transaction fees and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the placement for general working capital purposes 
if we believe it is in our interest to raise additional funds  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow additional money 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
a substantial portion of our available cash funds is in business accounts with reputable financial institutions 
however  our deposits  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
we did not hold any marketable securities as of december  as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
subsequent events that may impact liquidity as discussed previously  on december   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire scient x  a global medical device company based in guyancourt  france that designs  develops and manufacturers surgical implants to treat disorders of the spine 
the transaction is structured as an all stock transaction such that of outstanding scient x stock will be exchanged pursuant to a fixed ratio for  shares of our common stock 
the transaction is currently expected to close by the end of the first quarter of and is subject to the approval of our shareholders 
on february   we entered into subscription agreements with a group of purchasers for the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  after deducting expenses  were approximately million 
the offering closed on february  on february   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to register for resale by healthpointcapital up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we account for revenue under provisions which set forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
determination of criteria iii and iv are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
specifically  our revenue from sales of medical devices is recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title and the related risks and rewards that go with it 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
during  we shipped product to european distributors in which the terms of such sales included extended payment terms 
as a result of offering payment terms greater than our customary us business terms  and operating in a new market in which we have limited prior experience  revenues for purchases by distributors in europe have been deferred until the earlier of either the date upon which payments are due or until cash is received for such purchases 
during  we shipped product to a us distributor that did not have an extensive credit history 
as a result of a lack of extensive credit history  revenues for purchases by this distributor have been deferred until cash is received 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined under the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and record a reserve for the identified items 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our biologic implant inventories have a five year shelf life and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty as we are a high growth company  and we are continually reviewing our existing products and introducing new products 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding increase to cost of revenues and establish a new cost basis for the part 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets annually in december or each quarter if business conditions change and an earlier impairment indicator arises 
this assessment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets can not be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under provisions which require that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  the expected term for our stock options  the number of options expected to ultimately vest  and the timing of vesting for our share based awards 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award 
our estimated volatility through december  was based on a weighted average volatility of our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering in june and the historical stock volatilities of similar peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available 
our calculation of estimated volatility is based in part on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a 
table of contents period equal to the expected life of the awards 
we continue to use the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price since our initial public offering 
our estimated volatility may increase or decrease depending on the changes in our peer entities historical stock prices  changes in the composition of the peer entity group and changes to the expected term of our stock option awards 
an increase in the estimated volatility would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
our estimated expected term through december  was calculated using a weighted average term based on historical exercise patterns and the term from option date to full exercise for the options granted within the specified date range 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon us treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we use historical data to estimate the number of future stock option forfeitures 
share based compensation recorded in our consolidated statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
we account for stock option grants to non employees under provisions which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are rendered 
share based compensation expense of awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our share based awards could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
stock based compensation has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except per share data year ended december  cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total effect on basic and diluted net loss per share income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 

table of contents valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized 
in making such a determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued new accounting guidance that requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective july   we adopted newly issued accounting guidance which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification  or the codification  as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is non authoritative 
the codification does not change gaap and did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in june  we adopted newly issued accounting guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective january   we adopted newly issued accounting guidance for the useful life of intangible assets 
the guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective january  we adopted newly issued accounting guidance for business combinations 
the guidance retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent considerations and contractual contingencies  at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  an acquiring company is required to capitalize in process research and development and either amortize it over the life of the product  or expense it upon abandonment or impairment 
the guidance also requires expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the new guidance applies to business combinations completed on or after january  effective january   we adopted newly issued accounting guidance that addresses application issues on initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the new guidance applies to business combinations completed on or after january  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our borrowings under our line of credit expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding floating rate indebtedness totaled million 
the primary base interest rate is the us federal prime rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on our floating rate indebtedness remains constant over a year  a basis point increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 
other outstanding debt consists of fixed rate instruments  including the term loan and capital leases 
foreign currency risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we maintain operations in foreign countries  primarily japan and europe  that require payments in the local currency 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
for example  if the value of the us dollar were to increase relative to the japanese yen  then our reported revenues would decrease when we convert the japanese yen into us dollars 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
however  the currency exposure in our foreign currency revenues is mitigated because expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are payable in foreign currencies 
we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time 
commodity price risk we purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium and stainless steel 
these purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact our product costs 
however  because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of revenues  we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices 
a change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december
