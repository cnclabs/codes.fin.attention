general we are organized into two operating segments  outdoor channel or toc and production services 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
an overview of our two operating segments follows 
the outdoor channel or toc is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
toc revenues include advertising fees from advertisements aired on outdoor channel and 
table of contents fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel and subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
production services is comprised of our wholly owned subsidiary  winnercomm  inc which in turn wholly owns cablecam  inc 
and skycam  inc these businesses are involved in the production  development and marketing of sports programming and aerial camera systems 
production services revenues include revenue from sponsorship and advertising fees from company ad inventory  revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts  revenue from camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from web page design and marketing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as customer retention patterns  allowance for bad debts  useful lives of assets  asset valuations including cash flow projections  recoverability of assets  potential unasserted claims under contractual obligations  income taxes  reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated balance sheet and reported amount of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
accordingly  actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition toc generates revenue through advertising fees from advertisements and infomercials aired on outdoor channel  fees paid by outside producers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel and from subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor 
production services revenue includes revenue from sponsorship and advertising fees from company ad inventory  revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts  revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from web page design and marketing 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
costs incurred prior to completion and delivery are reflected as prepaid production costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
advances of contract fees prior to completion and delivery are shown as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
revenue from each event is based on an agreed upon contracted amount plus allowed expenses 
revenue from web page design and marketing is recognized upon the completion of services 
commission revenue from the marketing of program advertising  and commercial air time is recognized when the advertising or commercial air time occurs 
in the normal course of business  the company acts as or uses an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties 
certain transactions are recorded on a gross or net basis depending on whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction or acting as an agent in the transaction 
we serve as the principal in transactions in which we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership and  accordingly  record revenue on a gross basis 
for those transactions in which we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership  we are considered an agent in the transaction and  accordingly  record revenue on a net basis 
as such  we record revenue when our commission is earned 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising 
table of contents time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
revenues recognized do not exceed the total of the cash payments received and cash received in excess of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated or improved  whether due to customer specific or general economic conditions  we make appropriate adjustments to the allowance 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  pursuant to a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach 
if the fair value of any of our reporting units exceeds the carrying values of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to any of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
during the second quarter of  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from the last day of its third quarter september to the first day of its fourth quarter october 
the company selected this date to perform its annual goodwill impairment test because it believes the new date is preferable in these circumstances as it better aligns the timing of the impairment test with the company s long range planning process  giving it more visibility 
in addition  the october test date is preferable because it allows additional time for management to plan and execute its review of the completeness and accuracy of the impairment testing process 
the annual impairment analysis performed as of september  and  respectively  did not indicate any impairment 
in accordance with this change  the company conducted its annual impairment test as of october  the annual impairment analysis performed as of september  did not indicate any impairment 
the company performed an annual impairment test as of october  which did not indicate any impairment 
we currently have two reporting units  toc and production services 
the production services reporting unit consists of winnercomm  cablecam and skycam businesses which were acquired on january  all of the company s goodwill is currently attributed to our toc reporting unit 
there were no other changes to our reporting units or allocation of goodwill by reporting units during determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues  cost of services  other expenses and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of our annual assessment date were a expected cash flow for the period from to plus a terminal year  b a discount rate of  which is based on marketplace participant expectations  and c a debt free net cash flow long term growth rate of which is based on expected levels of growth for nominal gdp and inflation 

table of contents as of october   if forecasted debt free net cash flow growth had been lower than estimated  sensitivity calculations indicate that goodwill attributed to toc would not be impaired 
as of october   if the discount rate applied in our analysis had been higher than estimated  sensitivity calculations indicate that goodwill attributed to toc would not be impaired 
as of october   the company would have been required to perform the second step of the implied fair value analysis had the projected cash flow growth rate been less than negative four percent 
changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment  including expected future cash flows and discount rate  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
during  the company relied on the guideline company method under the market approach to determine the fair value of our toc reporting unit 
in  the income approach replaced the market approach methodology utilized in the previous year as the company believes that the income approach is a more accurate basis for measuring the fair values of a public company with multiple reporting units 
prepaid programming costs we produce a portion of the programming we air on our channels in house 
the cost of production is expensed when the show airs 
as such  we have incurred costs for programming that is yet to air 
these costs are accumulated on the balance sheet as prepaid programming costs 
costs of specific shows will be charged to programming expense based on anticipated airings  when the program airs and the related advertising revenue is recognized 
at the time it is determined that a program will not likely air  we charge to programming expense any remaining costs recorded in prepaid programming costs 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated  whether due to customer specific or general economic issues  increases in the allowance may be made 
share based compensation we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense is recognized over the service period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we account for stock options granted to non employees using the fair value method 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we follow the accounting guidance which provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods 
also included is guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb s accounting standards codification asc is effective for all interim and annual financial statements issued after september  the asc is now the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the historical gaap hierarchy was eliminated and the asc became the only level of authoritative gaap  other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
our accounting policies were not affected by the conversion to the asc 
however  we have conformed references to specific accounting standards in these notes to consolidated financial statements to the appropriate section of the asc 
in april  the fasb issued new guidance on the recognition of other than temporary impairments of investments in debt securities  as well as financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments of investments in debt and equity securities 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance for the quarter ended june  the cumulative effect of adoption increased the company s retained earnings with an offsetting decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of  with no overall change to shareholders equity 
see note for information on the company s other than temporary impairments including additional required disclosures 
in june  the fasb established general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
we have evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures that are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  the following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented  expressed in terms of dollars  dollar change  percentage change and as a percent of total revenue all dollar amounts are in thousands change of total revenue revenues advertising subscriber fees production services total revenues cost of services programming satellite transmission fees production and operations other direct costs total cost of services other expenses advertising selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total other expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income from operations before income taxes income tax provision net income loss percentages may not add due to rounding overview on january  we acquired winnercomm see note of the consolidated financial statements and began operating in two segments  production services and toc 
the consolidated statements of operations include the financial results of the production services segment from the date of acquisition 
for additional information regarding business segments  refer to note segment information of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s total revenues increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million for the year ended december  of revenues from our production services segment 
the advertising revenue decrease from our toc segment of for the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in demand caused by current economic conditions 
the increase in subscriber fees from our toc segment of for the year ended december  was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in the number of subscribers 
our total cost of services increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million in production and operations costs from our production services segment for the year ended december  cost of services from our toc segment to provide our broadcast signal  programming and production services decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due primarily to decreases in personnel compensation and consulting costs in addition to decreases in programming expense and satellite transmission fees 

table of contents other expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization related to our production services segment for the year ended december  other expenses from our toc segment decreased for the year ended december  due primarily to reduced legal and accounting fees  reduced marketing expenditures  partially offset by increased executive compensation expenses associated with the increase in subscribers and renewal of subscriber agreements as compared to revenues our revenues are composed of advertising fees  subscriber fees and production services 
advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on outdoor channel including advertisements shown during a program also known as short form advertising and infomercials in which the advertisement is the program itself also known as long form advertising 
advertising revenue is also generated from fees paid by third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel 
subscriber fees are generated from cable and satellite service providers who pay monthly subscriber fees to us for the right to broadcast our channel 
production services revenue is generated from production services for customer owned telecasts  aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from web page design and marketing 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 
advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million viewers compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the decrease in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects decreased demand for our advertising inventory caused by the current economic conditions 
we expect demand for our advertising inventory will fluctuate within our programming genre niche due primarily to current economic conditions 
these conditions make it harder to estimate future revenues because the advertisers are generally buying inventory much closer to the actual time of airing instead of contracting for the advertising inventory in advance 
in addition  we expect continued competitive pressure to negatively impact future long form advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees was primarily due to increases in the subscriber fee rates charged to new and existing service providers carrying outdoor channel and by an increase in subscribers at several service providers 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen s estimate was at million subscribers 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
the estimate regarding outdoor channel s subscriber base is made by nielsen media research and is theirs alone  and does not represent our opinions  forecasts or predictions 
it should not be implied that we endorse nor necessarily concur with such information  simply due to our reference to or distribution of their estimate 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base  and we have seen it decrease over the past year 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen might even report additional declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
we are pursuing subscriber growth by utilizing various means including offering lower subscriber fees for broader distribution and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the 
table of contents newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
if we are successful with these tactics  our net subscriber fee revenue may decrease over the short term future 
production services revenue for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december   which was prior to our acquisition of winnercomm 
the decrease for the year ended december  was due primarily to the non renewal of several production contracts which expired prior to our acquisition of winnercomm and revenue from several one time production events which did not occur in the corresponding current year period 
we continue to evaluate the production services segment for increased profitability 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing our broadcast signal and programming to the distributors for transmission to the consumer 
cost of services includes programming costs  satellite transmission fees  production and operations costs  and other direct costs 
in addition  cost of services includes production related labor and other costs related to our production services segment 
total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  due primarily to the inclusion of production services 
as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of lower expenses incurred with some programs being produced internally by the production services segment versus being produced by unaffiliated third parties and a higher proportion of shows being aired over quarters versus two quarters for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in our policy is to amortize costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then amortized to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has typically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we amortize programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
our programming costs per show are expected to increase as we continue to improve the quality of our in house produced shows  and we expect our aggregate programming costs to remain relatively consistent over the foreseeable future 
as our programming strategy evolves  we will reconsider the appropriate amortization life of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in satellite transmission fees was primarily due to lower monthly fees associated with our new satellite agreement which became effective in june production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs for the year ended december  relates primarily to the inclusion of costs associated with our production services segment 
production and operations costs for the year ended december  from our toc segment were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs for our toc segment relates primarily to increased professional fees of approximately  and increased compensation related expenses of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in production costs associated with an annual marketing event of approximately  and a decrease in signal receivers of approximately  production and operation expenses for our production services segment primarily consist of costs directly associated with producing and providing services for customer owned telecasts as 
table of contents well as web site design and marketing 
production and operations costs for the year ended december  from our production services segment were  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december   which was prior to our acquisition of winnercomm 
the decrease in costs for our production services segment was due primarily to production costs incurred on several one time production events and contractual events during the year ended december  which did not occur in the corresponding current year period 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  our other direct costs may decrease over the foreseeable future due to the amortization of subscriber acquisition fees  also referred to as launch support fees  where the costs are in excess of the related subscriber revenue 
other expenses other expenses consist of the cost of advertising  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
total other expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily due to management s decision to reduce overall spending on advertising materials  programs and campaigns 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses relates primarily to the inclusion of expenses of our production services segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  from our toc segment were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease during year ended december  was primarily due to reduced legal and accounting fees of approximately  associated with the elimination of duplicate audit and tax service providers incurred in connection with the transition of audit and tax service providers and reduced use of outside legal services compared to the corresponding period in in addition  expenses related to annual marketing events decreased approximately  and our provision for doubtful accounts decreased approximately  as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by revised compensation plans for our executives and increased executive bonus compensation related to the increases in subscribers and renewal of subscriber agreements which increased expenses by approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in selling  general and administrative expenses related to our production services segment for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december  which was prior to our acquisition of winnercomm 
the decrease was due primarily to reductions in personnel and related compensation expenses which were terminated and not included in our acquisition of winnercomm 
we have added to our professional and support staff across all departments over the past year to support our initiatives in subscriber growth and in other areas such as accounting and finance 
in addition to base salaries and bonuses  we utilize share based compensation packages as incentives for our employees 
we have generally utilized restricted stock grants as opposed to stock options or performance units 
for tax purposes  the tax deduction for restricted stock  subject to the limitations on the deductibility of employee remuneration of internal revenue code section m  is the fair market value of the company s stock on the date the restrictions lapsed eg vesting 
although we may find it necessary to motivate prospective or current employees with additional cash and or equity 
table of contents awards  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will remain relatively consistent over the foreseeable future 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily relates to increases in fixed and intangible assets from the acquisition of our production services segment 
income from operations income from operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the decrease in our income from operations was driven by losses in our production services segment 
this loss was partially offset by growth in our subscriber fees and reduced programming  satellite  production  advertising and selling  general and administrative expenses in our toc segment 
as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  subscriber rate relief for our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch or advertising support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as broadband  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be constrained for the short term future until scale is achieved 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale and auction rate securities 
we anticipate a low interest rate environment for the coming year  and therefore we expect no significant fluctuation in interest earned in future periods 
income from operations before income taxes income from operations before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we generated income before income taxes for the year ended december  amounting to  a decrease of  compared to income of  for the year ended december  the loss from operations from our production services segment for the year ended december  was  income tax provision income tax provision from operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the income tax provision reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and is different than that computed based on the applicable statutory federal income tax rate of primarily due to state taxes  the tax effect of accounting for share based compensation and the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation as provided for in internal revenue code section m 
the effective income tax rate was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the change in pre tax earnings from continuing operations and the factors described above for the year ended december  net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was a net loss of  a decrease of  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the reasons described above

advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflected an increase in the rates charged for short form advertising and an increase in the time buy rates charged to producers 

table of contents for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million viewers compared to million for the same period subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees was primarily due to increases in the subscriber fee rate charged to new and existing service providers carrying outdoor channel and by an increase in subscribers at several service providers 
cost of services total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of increased programming expenses associated with new shows and the write off of certain lower quality programs  partially offset by cancellations during the period 
our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has historically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly

we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  was primarily due to lower monthly fees associated with our new satellite agreement which became effective in june production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs for the year ended december  related primarily to an increase of approximately  in broadband services and an increase of approximately  in personnel and related compensation costs associated with increased production and programming 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was principally related to more expense being recognized through amortization of launch support during the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of less revenue being received upon renewal of our affiliation agreement from those service providers to whom we previously paid launch support

as of december   we held  of auction rate securities classified as long term assets 
auction rate securities are investment vehicles with long term or perpetual maturities which pay interest monthly at current market rates reset through a dutch auction 
beginning in february  the majority of auctions for these types of securities failed due to liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets 
our auction rate securities followed this trend and experienced multiple failed auctions due to insufficient investor demand 
as there is a limited secondary market for auction rate securities  we have been unable to convert our positions to cash 
we do not anticipate being in a position to liquidate all of these investments until there is a successful auction or the security issuer redeems their security  and accordingly  have reflected our investments in auction rate securities as non current assets on our balance sheet 
due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these investments 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves for similar securities  market rates of returns  and the expected term of each security 
in making assumptions of required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
our auction rate security investments continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  are fully collateralized by underlying financial instruments primarily closed end preferred and municipalities and have maintained at least a credit ratings despite the failure of the auction process 
we believe that based on the company s current cash  cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities balances at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow  financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
net cash used by investing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities related principally to the purchases of short term available for sale securities  our acquisition of winnercomm and an increase in capital expenditures for fixed asset replacements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of  and  respectively 
at december   all of our securities were auction rate securities with long term maturities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the amount of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we currently do not have significant transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we currently have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
