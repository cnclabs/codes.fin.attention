overview innotrac  founded in and headquartered in atlanta  georgia  is a full service fulfillment and logistics provider serving enterprise clients and world class brands 
the company employs sophisticated order processing and warehouse management technology and operates seven fulfillment centers and one call center in seven cities spanning all time zones across the continental united states 
prior to  the company was primarily focused on the telecommunications industry  with over of its revenues being derived through this vertical 
today  the company primarily serves four lines of business  or industry verticals 
this is a result of a significant effort made by the company to diversify both its industry and client base over the past several years 
we classify those industry verticals as i ecommerce and retail  ii direct marketing  iii business to business  and iv telecommunication products and modems 
as a result of consolidation in both the end service provider and product supplier levels in the telecommunications industry  the company will be adjusting its service offering to this vertical in during the second quarter of  we expect to launch a full channe l support product and service offering for the purchase  sale and distribution of land line telephones under the at t brand in selected markets where at t provides services 
we project this service to be provided to all at t serviced markets by early during  the following significant events occurred a 
in january  the company and gsi commerce inc mutually terminated the october  agreement and plan of merger between the two companies 
neither party had any financial obligation to the other as a result of the termination 
innotrac had incurred approximately  of legal  investment banking and accounting expenses on the terminated transaction during the year ended december  which expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations for the twelve months ended december  b 
in april  we closed the company s second call center in reno  nevada and consolidated its operations into our call center in pueblo  colorado 
c 
in june   we ended fulfillment services for at t dsl fast access modems and provided for severance expenses for administrative employees associated with that business 
d 
in july  the company was notified by smith hawken  ltd 
that its parent company would be closing the smith hawken business and liquidating its assets 
innotrac ended its fulfillment services contract with smith and hawken in october   which contract recorded million of service revenues between january to october e 
in october  we closed the company s romeoville  illinois fulfillment warehouse 
f 
in october  we relocated the company s combined corporate headquarters and atlanta fulfillment warehouse to separate atlanta locations allowing for a reduction in total square footage leased by over with options with the landlords to expand 
the combined revenue generated from the at t dsl fast access account  the romeoville  illinois customers and smith and hawken represented approximately million or of our total service revenues of million for the year ended december  as a result  we project that our service revenue in will be less than we generated in recognizing this expected reduction of revenue in  the completion of the events described above also resulted in a significant effort to offset the lost revenue by reducing fixed operating expenses 
additionally  taking advantage of the economic turndown  we negotiated rate reductions in several of our building lease agreements which will generate approximately million of reduced rental expense in as compared to our actual rent paid i n this rent reduction was accomplished without losing installed capacity or the ability to expand our rented space with minimal capital expenditure if required by future demand 
we recognize that the state of the united states economy has negatively affected our existing clients and that reducing costs is only a part of our plans to produce profitable results going forward 
although we expect some improvement in the revenues from our existing clients in  we increased our investment in our sales and marketing capabilities in the second half of and continue to do so in during  we created a new position and hired a vice president of marketing redesigned the innotrac web site and launched the site in early january created two new business development associate positions and hired them in early january increased sales and marketing expenditures for existing client and new client development efforts we anticipate that the downturn in the economy will ultimately turn around at some point in the future 
replacing the revenue we lost in is our immediate focus in the coming year 
accordingly reductions in leased facilities for fulfillment services  call center and administration have been made to offset the lost revenue  but we have strategically maintained expansion capability with our landlords and have not reduced our administrative  information technology or operations management staffing 
therefore  we are well positioned for growth that we expect to occur by selling new accounts and with a positive change in the economy 
nevertheless  will be a year in which we project a net loss 
additionally  because the speed with which we can generate new client sales and the improvement in the economy are estimates  under the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  as more fully discussed in our principal accounting policies and financial statements below  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of innotrac has twenty five years of experience as a provider of fulfillment services with installed capacity sufficient to support revenue growth of over twenty percent of our reported service revenues 
with no outstanding debt at december   we have the liquidity to invest in our growth while the economy recovers 
macro economic factors at the end of and the beginning of  the united states economy and equity markets went into a negative cycle 
as discussed above  to offset that downturn  from the beginning of we were focused on improving our operating efficiencies while in the second half of  we began to invest in our sales and marketing organization 
the downturn in the economy in the later part of has affected nearly all sectors of the economy and continued through all of our fourth quarter units shipped for all industry segments for existing clients was less than it was for the same clients during the fourth quarter of current economic forecasts suggest that the current downturn is expected to continue t hrough most of we are continuing to monitor the economic trends and business experience of our customers and closely manage our operating costs which vary with volume 
additionally  we believe our mix of multiple customer industries provides some protection from the impact of the downturn as the economy recovers 
however  as discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k our results can be negatively affected depending on the severity or concentration by industry of the economic downturn we are experiencing 
business mix the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues generated by the company s various business lines during and the service offerings for a particular client changed in from resulting in that client s revenue to move from the direct marketing vertical to the ecommerce direct to consumer vertical 
as a result  of revenues from the direct marketing vertical were reallocated to the ecommerce direct to consumer vertical business line vertical ecommerce direct to consumer direct marketing modems telecommunications products bb ecommerce direct to consumer and direct marketing 
the company provides a variety of services for a significant number of ecommerce  retail  and direct marketing clients which include such companies as target 
com  a division of target corporation  ann taylor retail  inc  the north face  microsoft  inc  product partners and thane international 
our revenues are a result of the number of orders and customer service calls received 
our client contracts generally do not guarantee volumes 
the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and retail clients increased during as compared to as result of thei r decrease in dollars of revenue sold during from being a lesser decrease than the other two categories 
we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and direct to consumer clients will increase during as we continue to see growth in our customers from this group of clients to be higher than our other client categories 
telecommunications and modems 
the company has historically been a major provider of fulfillment and customer support services to the telecommunications industry 
the consolidation in that industry over the last several years has resulted in a heavy concentration of volume in a few companies and accordingly concentration of the service providers to the telecommunication industry 
we completed the transition of the dsl fast access modem fulfillment services we provided at t to its in house fulfillment organization 
we continue to provide other fulfillment and technology services for at t and other customers in the te lecommunications industry 
we had previously projected that our revenues to this vertical would decline below of our total revenues starting in if during  however  we begin selling land line telephones to consumers as discussed in item i  business  our current projections indicate that revenues to this vertical will remain above of our total revenues during as discussed in the overview paragraph of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we expect to launch a new service and product offering to one of our telecommunications clients  at t 
that offering will report revenues and cost of revenues inclusive of amounts related to product cost and the complete cost of sale and distribution of that product to the end consumer 
the percentage of revenues presented in the above chart are for combined service fees and freight revenues only since during and all of our revenues resulted from fee for services performed rather than revenues for products sold 
business to business 
the company provides a variety of services for business to business bb clients including napa and the walt disney company 
the decrease of of total revenues from in to in resulted from both the loss of one client in this vertical and a reduction in the outsourced fulfillment needs of another client in this category 
although we continue to provide services to business in this vertical  we expect future revenues in this category to remain a smaller portion of our total business mix 
results of operations the following table sets forth summary operating data  expressed as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december  and operating results for any period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the percentages below are calculated using the detailed information contained in the financial statements and notes thereto 
thousands of dollars year ended december  service revenues freight revenues total revenues cost of service revenues freight expense selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income before goodwill impairment goodwill impairment operating loss income other expense loss income before taxes income tax provision benefit net loss income percent of total revenues year ended december  service revenues freight revenues total revenues cost of service revenues freight expense selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment depreciation and amortization operating loss income other expense loss income before taxes income tax provision benefit net loss income service revenues 
the company s service revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in service revenues is primarily attributable to i a million decrease in revenue from our modem and telecom clients primarily due to the transition of a portion of the at t fulfillment business to at t s in house fulfillment as previously discussed  ii a million decrease in our ecommerce vertical resulting from the loss of the smith hawken business and the clients serviced in the romeoville facility and reduced volumes from existing clients due to negative economic conditions during compared to  iii a million decrease in revenues from our direct marketing vertical due to the loss of a client and reduced volumes from remaining clients due to the negative economic conditions  and iv a million decrease in revenues from our bb clients due to the loss of a client serviced in the romeoville facility and decreased volumes from another client in the bb category 
freight revenues 
the company s freight revenues decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in freight revenues is primarily attributable to a million decrease in our direct marketing vertical due to the loss of a client and decreased volumes  a million decrease in our ecommerce vertical due to reduced volumes and the transition of company owned freight accounts to client owned freight accounts  a  decrease in bb revenue due to reduced volumes and a  decrease in revenue from our modem and telecom clients primarily due to the trans ition of a portion of the at t fulfillment services in house 
cost of service revenues 
the company s cost of service revenues  which include labor costs for the fulfillment and call centers  telephone minute fees and packaging material costs  decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of service revenues as a percent of service revenues decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cost of service revenues was primarily due to the combined effect of a decrease in labor costs related to the decreases in service revenue  a decreased use of higher cost temporary labor services and operating efficiencies resulting from adjusting labor shifts to correspond with client volumes 
freight expense 
the company s freight expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to the decrease in corresponding freight revenue for the reasons discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
s  g a expenses  which include facility and equipment costs  account services and information technology costs  management salaries and legal and accounting fees  decreased to million or of revenues for the year ended december  compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million reduction in facility management  equipment maintenance and account management costs made to respond to reductions in revenue discussed above  onetime transaction costs of  incurred in related to a terminated merger agreement  a  reduction in facility costs related to renegotiated lease costs and the closure of the romeoville facility in november  a  reduction in worker s compensation insurance expense due to an adjustment of experience rates by the ohio bureau of workers compensation  reduced sales commission expense of  related to client accounts no longer eligible for sales commission and reductions in travel  information technology maintenance costs  telephone and supply expenses resulting from focused efforts to reduce costs 
goodwill impairment expense 
during the fourth quarter  of  we observed a reduction in unit volumes from our existing clients when comparing the same week periods of to our business has always experienced certain seasonality between the thanksgiving holiday to the new year holiday period 
due to the importance of that seasonal period  we determined that if revenue from our existing clients remained less than expected through the holiday season we would review our carrying value of goodwill  as required by asc topic no business combinations and reorganizations  for possible impairment 
our annual test date for possible impairment of goodwill is january st of each year 
as more fully discussed under the section entitled critical accounting policies below and in note to our financial statements  the impairment testing required by asc at january  resulted in a non cash million goodwill impairment charge to earnings  which was a impairment of the carrying value the company s recorded goodwill at december  accordingly  we recorded the non cash impairment charge at december  income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended and was 
at december   a valuation allowance was recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets as losses in recent years created uncertainty about the realization of tax benefits in future years 
the existence of a net operating loss carryforward at december  means that income taxes associated with any potential taxable earnings for the year ended december  will be offset by a corresponding decrease of this valuation allowance  resulting in an expected effective tax rate of for the year ended december  as wel l 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the company funds its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na the credit facility 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at both december  and additionally  at december   the company had no borrowings under its credit facility compared to having borrowings of million at december  the repayment of the million of borrowings under the credit facility was the result of the contraction of seasonal working capital needs which reach a peak at the end of any calendar year and improved operating margins in the business during the first half of the company generated million of cash from operating activities in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities compared to generating million cash from operating activities in the year ended december  the million increase in cash provided from operating activities was generated from materially different components in compared to in  million reduction in accounts receivable offset by a million reduction in accounts payable  a million increase in inventory and a  decrease in accrued expenses 
in  million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  and a reduction of million in accounts receivable were offset by a million reduction in accounts payable and a million net use of cash in all other working capital and non cash operating expenses 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in the million in resulted from million of capital expenditures made in various facilities to improve operating efficiency or replace equipment as needed  offset by  of cash provided by a net change in long term assets and liabilities 
the million in resulted from million of capital expenditures  incurred for replacement of equipment and selected improvement in facilities with growing customer activity offset by  of cash provided by a net change in long term assets and liabilities 
during the year ended december   the net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million of net cash used in financing activities in in  million of the million cash used in financing activities was for the repayment of the obligations outstanding under the credit facility 
in  million of cash used to repay the second lien loan was partially offset by net increased borrowing under the credit facility of million 
the company estimates that its cash and financing needs through will be met by cash flows from operations and availability from its credit facility 
the company generated positive cash flows from operations in and as discussed in the overview paragraph of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we anticipate reduced levels of revenue in due to those reduced revenues  and without the added revenue which will result from the sale of land line telephones  if that new business opportunity occurs in  the company anticipates that cash flow from operations in will be close to zero and could be slightly positive or negative 
if the new business opportunity of selling land line telephones does occur  we anticipate that cash flow from operations would be negative as a result of the additional cash needed to finance a growth in accounts receivable caused by the nd through th installment payments related to those sales 
we had no advances under and were in compliance with all requirements of our bank credit facility at december  we will require use of the facility throughout and based on our projections of operating performance  we have begun negotiations with our bank to amend the credit agreement to provide availability for certain accounts receivable and inventory which are currently excluded from collateral under the terms of the facility and to avoid projected future noncompliance with certain of the facilities financial covenants 
we expect to agree on satisfactory terms for the amendment with the bank which will provide continuous availability under the line to finance our business liquidity needs in however  as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have not completed those negotiations and do not have a signed amendment 
failure to successfully obtain an amendment or comply with the covenants of the credit agreement in the future could negatively affect our credit ratings or impair our ability to finance our operations which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
credit facilities 
the credit facility matures on june  the credit facility had a maximum borrowing limit of million at december  and million at december  the credit facility  as renewed on march  reduced the maximum borrowing limit by million  among other changes  due to the company forecasting a lower level of borrowing need during the remaining term of the credit facility 
the credit facility is used to fund the company s capital expenditures  operational working capital and seasonal working capital needs 
although total advances under the credit facility cannot exceed the maximum borrowing limit of million at december   the credit facility limits borrowings at any time to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  which totaled million at december  the terms of the credit facility provide that the amount borrowed and outstanding at any time combined with certain reserves for rental payments  letters of credit outstanding and general reserves be subtracted from the facility limit or the value of the total collateral to arrive at an amount of unused availability to borrow under the line of credit 
the total collateral under the credit facility at december  amounted to million 
the amount borrowed and outstanding and the total value of re serves and letters of credit outstanding at december  amounted to million 
as a result  the company had million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit line at december  the company has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the lender as collateral under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains a restrictive fixed charge coverage ratio 
the provisions of the credit facility require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender  and allows the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
upon renewal of the credit facility on march   the company was required to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing fixed charge coverage ratio of 
the company was in compliance with all terms of the credit facility at december  in accordance with the sixth amendment to the credit facility signed on october   interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable monthly at rates equal to the prime rate plus or at the company s option  libor plus 
the credit facility also provided for higher interest rates if the fixed charge ratio fell below to  however that event did not occur during while the million second lien loan was outstanding  interest was accrued on a monthly basis equal to the greater of a libor or b plus for a rate of of the principal balance plus accrued interest payable and outstanding under the second lien loan 
for the year ended december   we paid interest expense of  on the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
during the year ended december  the company incurred interest expense related to the credit facility of approximately  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of and  of interest at a constant rate of on the second lien loan from its inception on september  through its payoff on september  our weighted average interest rate in  including amounts borrowed under both the credit facility and the second lien loan  was 
at december   the rate of interest being charged on the credit facility was 
the company also incurred unused revolving credit facility fees of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
on march   the company entered into a fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement the credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association the bank 
the credit agreement amends and restates in its entirety the previously effective third amended and restated loan and security agreement between the company and the bank  dated as of march  and amended from time to time thereafter  and sets forth the new terms of the revolving credit facility there under as amended by the credit agreement  the credit facility 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the term of the credit facility has been extended through june  the credit facility has a maximum borrowing limit of million including the issuance of letters of credit up to million in face value  but limits borrowings to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit agreement continues the bank s security interest in all of the company s assets  but releases the bank s previously granted security interest in certain personal assets of scott dorfman  the company s chairman  president and ceo  which were treated as additional collateral under the credit agreement 
interest on borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement is payable monthly at specified rates ranging from either the base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus between and  or  at the company s option  the libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus between and  in each case with the applicable margin depending on the company s average excess availability as defined in the credit agreement 
the company will pay a specified fee on undrawn amounts under the credit facility 
after an event of default  all loans will bear interest at the otherwise applicable rate plus per annum 
the credit agreement contains such financial  affirmative and negative covenants by the company as are usual and customary for financings of this kind which can result in the acceleration of the maturity of amounts borrowed under the credit facility  including  without limitation  change in ownership control covenants  a subjective material adverse change covenant and financial covenants establishing a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum annual capital expenditures  and minimum excess availability as such terms are defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also defines as an event of default any termination of the employment of the chief financial officer of the company  if the company fails to fill such position with a replacement acceptable to the bank within days 
the pr ovisions of the credit agreement require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the bank  and allows the bank to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
the credit agreement includes such events of default and  as appropriate  grace periods and representations and warranties as are usual and customary for financings of this kind 
the company paid a customary closing fee upon the closing of the credit agreement and would pay a specified fee upon any early termination of the credit facility  which fees are customary for transactions of this type 
additionally  from september  through its repayment on september   the company had a million second lien loan outstanding to a credit management company 
the million second lien loan outstanding was entered into when we determined that completion of capital expenditure projects in late and forecasted working capital requirements to support our seasonal volume increase during the fourth quarter of required additional short term funding 
the seasonal working capital needs were significant as a result of our growth in annual revenue to million in compared to million in the million second lien loan was repaid on september  from a combination of funds generated by operating income and additional borrowing under the credit facil ity 
contractual obligations 
the company s primary long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases 
as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in addition  as of december   the company did not participate in any guarantees of other entities obligations  structured finance arrangements  synthetic leases  repurchase obligations or similar commercial or financing commitments

accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
for additional information  including information regarding the interest related to the revolving line of credit  see note critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company adopted asc topic no 
business combinations and reorganizations  which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under asc topic no 
 goodwill impairment may exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with asc topic no 
 the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of events that may indicate possible impairment 
asc topic no 
requires that goodwill be tested as of the same date every year  innotrac s annual testing date is the first day following year end  which was january  additionally  in accordance with asc topic no 
 upon the occurrence of certain triggering events which management considers could result in the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill  the company must test the carrying value of goodwill at the time immediately following those triggering events which could be at a time different than the annual review date of january  as more fully disclosed in note  our annual review date of january st coincided with less than expected operating performance in the fourth quarter of our normal annual business cycle includes increased volumes during the holiday period of thanksgiving to new years 
we experienced volumes from our existing clients for the quarter ended december  which was less than the same quarter of resulting in a triggering event which coincided with our annual review date 
asc topic no 
prescribes a two step testing process for determining goodwill impairment of any individual reporting unit of goodwill for a company 
innotrac has only one reporting unit for goodwill which is the company 
in the first step  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
the result of the first step indicated that the carrying amount of our goodwill was higher than the fair value of our reporting unit 
accordingly we performed the second testing process whereby we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if innotrac had acquired the reporting unit s in a business combination 
in the second step  the potential impairment was computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the company s net book value of recorded assets and liabilities after valuing all assets and liabilities  both tangible and intangible 
under the requirements of asc topic no 
 our second step of testing for impairment included review of the fair market value of our long lived fixed assets and the intangible assets of workforce  customer contracts and our trade name 
upon completion of its analysis for impairment as of january   the company determined that the carrying value of innotrac s goodwill as of december  was accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million at december  accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of million recorded in and the net losses generated in    and the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in innotrac has a net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years prior to and in as a result of the million noncash impairment of goodwill  create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
additionally  due to the reduced level of revenues expected in  the company expects to generate a taxable loss in therefore  the net losses incurred in and prior years combined with the expected loss in result in an inability to recognize the value of any deferred tax asset resulting from the prior years losses 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively against net deferred tax assets 
income taxes associated with future earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance in that future year 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax benefit of million was offset by a corresponding increase of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when and if the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates
