table of contents personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  for our operations management team  purchasing and quality control

provision for income taxes as of december   we maintain a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets in the united states  germany  japan and mexico 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that our net domestic deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not realizable 
as a result  we recorded a deferred tax provision charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance on our net domestic deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a cumulative three year domestic pre tax book income  however  we 
table of contents expect to be in a cumulative three year domestic pre tax book loss at least as of december  and due to the significant pre tax book loss incurred in therefore  the utilization of our net domestic deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  which cannot be projected with certainty at this time 
we have recorded a current year tax receivable of million related to the benefit of our current year federal tax net operating loss that will be carried back to prior years to recover previously paid income taxes 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will continue to monitor the need for valuation allowances in each jurisdiction  and may adjust our positions in the future based on actual results

we develop and market aesthetic treatment systems capital equipment that are used by physicians and other practitioners to perform non invasive and minimally invasive procedures in the aesthetic marketplace 
these procedures are discretionary and not reimbursed by third party insurers 
the significant majority of our business each year is derived from new customers 
a portion of our customers finance the purchase of these lasers through third party finance companies or banks 
during the year ended december   credit was more difficult to obtain and our potential customers were not as able to expand their practices or commit to purchasing equipment from us as compared to the year ended december  additionally  we believe that due to the uncertain and adverse business conditions  some of our customers and potential customers anticipated a decline in the number of patients seeking discretionary aesthetic laser treatments and therefore  decided not to purchase new systems during the year 
we believe that the availability of credit remains limited and demand for discretionary aesthetic laser treatments remains uncertain and as a result  our revenues may continue to be adversely affected 
revenues from sales of products outside of north america decreased by approximately million  or  from the period  due to a decrease in the number of units sold by our asian distributors and our european subsidiaries  which we attribute to the adverse global business conditions

our effective tax rate decreased from  primarily due to an increased benefit from the and research and development tax credit  a relative increase in tax exempt income  and a one time intercompany bad debt deduction claimed in error that was identified as a result of our irs examination but was settled in december liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through our initial public offering  private placements of equity securities  short term borrowings and funds generated from our operations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities  short term investments and related financial instruments were million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents of million are highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions 
our short term marketable securities of million consist of investments in 
table of contents various state and municipal governments  corporate bonds and treasuries all of which mature by december  our long term marketable securities of million consist of investments in us government agencies all of which mature by may  our short term investments and related financial instruments  which includes auction rate securities ars with a fair market value of million and a related right with a fair market value of million  consist primarily of tax exempt certificates with an auction reset feature auction rate securities  with underlying assets consisting generally of student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for ars and each auction since then has failed  with one exception 
during the years ended december  and  certain investments in ars were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
to date  during the first quarter of  we received an additional million in cash proceeds related to certain investments in ars that were successfully called at full par value 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights  or rights  from ubs financial services inc  or ubs 
the rights permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise these rights and put our auction rate securities back to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights  therefore  we have reclassified our ars and associated rights to short term investments and other related financial instruments as of december  these rights are nontransferable securities registered with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec 
as a result of accepting the rights  we have released ubs and its employees agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to ubs s marketing and sale of ars and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund 
during the fourth quarter of  we transferred the ars investments  at their fair value of million  from available for sale to trading marketable securities  as elected under the debt and equity securities topic asc we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million  which is based on the million fair value of the ars using a discounted cash flow methodology 
we recorded the million charge in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   for the amount of unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings 
upon acceptance of the rights  on november   we elected to measure the rights under the provisions of the fair value option topic asc and to recognize future changes in the fair value of the rights as they occur in operations in order to offset the fair value movements of the ars  which would create accounting symmetry with changes in the fair value of the ars 
as of december   we recorded approximately million as the fair value of the rights  using a discounted cash flow methodology and classified the rights as long term investments and related financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding credit to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a result of the illiquidity in the market for ars investments  we have estimated the fair value of our ars and the rights using a level valuation methodology 
during the year ended december   we recorded a recovery of million for the value of the ars and an offsetting loss of million in the fair value of the rights within other income expense in the statement of operations 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars will be mostly offset by the changes in the fair value of the related rights  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis until settlement 
based on our expectations for future operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and 
table of contents continued progress of our research and development of new products 
we incurred minimal capital expenditures during the year ended december   and expect that capital expenditures during the next months will be relatively consistent 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  we transferred million and million of demonstration equipment to fixed assets 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock  from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions under a stock repurchase program 
the program will terminate on august   unless our board of directors discontinues it sooner 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately  and at a weighted average price of per share under this program 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities  as well as cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily from net loss for the period of million  decreased by approximately million in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  million in deferred tax assets and approximately million in accretion of discounts on marketable securities 
net changes in working capital items reduced cash from operating activities by approximately million principally related to a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to reduced sales and increased collection efforts  and a decrease in inventory of million primarily related to less purchases made during and the sale of inventory on hand at december   net of a million charge to write down inventory 
this was offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets related to our tax receivable position  and a decrease in amounts due to related party  accrued expenses and accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of the net purchases of million of marketable securities  offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities  and partially offset by million used for fixed asset purchases

net changes in working capital items reduced cash from operating activities by approximately million  principally due to an increase in inventory for anticipated future sales and lower than expected sales for the fourth quarter  as well as an increase in accounts receivable reflecting the record sales during  an overall slowdown in collections as certain customers were affected by the overall economic environment and the tightening of the credit markets and an increase in accounts payable and amounts due to a related party 
these were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses

contractual obligations our significant outstanding contractual obligations relate to our capital leases from equipment financings and our facilities leases 
our facility leases are non cancellable and typically contain renewal options 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses for which we recognize the expense on a straight line basis 
in addition  we guaranteed the lease obligations for two facilities that are operated by sona medspa and will be obligated to pay these leases if sona medspa cannot or does not make the required lease payments 
we have summarized in the table below our fixed contractual cash obligations as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases lease guarantees total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition topic asc s  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and parts and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s relative fair value in accordance with the principles of asc  revenue recognition topic multiple element arrangements 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectability issues and our historical experience with losses 
the disruptions in the financial and credit markets  which began in the fourth quarter of  have reduced our customers and potential customers access to cash 
if the capital spending of our customers or potential customers continues to decrease  demand for our products would likely be adversely affected and our revenue will likely decline 
challenging economic and credit conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services for which they have contracted 
while we continue to complete appropriate credit review of our customers prior to shipment of product and revenue recognition  we may be required to write off accounts receivable that become uncollectible 
during the years ended december  and  we wrote off uncollectible accounts totaling approximately million and million  respectively  related to certain customers that no longer had the ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
these write offs related to a number of customer accounts that were not individually significant to us 
we believe that these customers were adversely affected by several factors resulting from a significant downturn in the overall economic environment  including declines in their business  reductions in financial liquidity  bankruptcy  lack of available credit and the loss of previously approved credit 
we believe we may continue to experience credit losses  which could cause our provisions for doubtful accounts to increase 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk inventories and allowance for excess and obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease in inventory primarily relates to reduced purchases for the year ended december   the sale of our inventory on hand at december  and the transfer of demonstration equipment 
our inventory allowance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in inventory allowance primarily relates to a million charge to cost of product revenues related to the write down of an earlier generation product 
the write down resulted in part from customers adopting our newer generation products more quickly than we anticipated  coupled with the downturn in the overall aesthetic laser market 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for 
table of contents additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
product warranty costs and provisions we provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
fair value of financial instruments effective january   we adopted the fair value measurements topic asc asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable markets data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our short term investments and related financial instruments consist of tax exempt certificates with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are generally student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed  with one exception 
to date we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
during the years ended december  and  certain investments in ars were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
to date  during the first quarter of  an additional million in cash proceeds was received by us related to certain investments in ars that were successfully called at full par value 
while the auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments  we believe that the ars failures will not have an impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
as of december  and  we held million and million  respectively  at par value  of auction rate securities investments 
the auction rate securities are managed by ubs 
on november   we agreed to accept the rights from ubs 
the rights permit us to sell  or put  our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise our ars rights and put 
table of contents our auction rate securities to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights  therefore  we have reclassified our ars and associated rights to short term investments and related financial instruments as of december  while the auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments  until we exercise our rights on june   we believe that the ars failures will not have an impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
during  in accordance with asc  we elected to transfer the ars investments from the available for sale category to the trading category and account for the ars at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur 
we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million  which is based on the million fair value of the ars using a discounted cash flow methodology 
we recorded the million charge in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   for the amount of unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings 
upon acceptance of the rights  on november   we elected to measure the rights under the provisions of asc and to recognize future changes in the fair value of the rights as they occur in operations in order to offset the fair value movements of the ars  which would create accounting symmetry with changes in the fair value of the ars 
as of december   we recorded approximately million as the fair value of the rights  using a discounted cash flow methodology and classified the rights as long term investments and related financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding credit to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a recovery in the value of the ars of million and an offsetting loss of million for the fair value of the rights within other income expense  net in the statement of operations 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars will be mostly offset by the changes in the fair value of the related rights  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis 
as a result of the illiquidity in the market for ars investments and given the current failures in the auction markets to provide quoted market prices of the securities  as well as the lack of any correlation of these instruments to other observable market data  we value our investments in ars and the rights using a discounted cash flow methodology with the most significant inputs categorized as level significant inputs that went into the model were the credit quality of the issuer  the percentage and types of guarantees such as federal family education loan program ffelp  the probability of the auction succeeding or the security being called  the estimated period to liquidation  and an illiquidity discount factor 
based on these inputs  discounts from par ranged from to with a weighted average discount across the portfolio of 
in order to assess the fair value of the rights  we adjusted the fair value of the rights for any bearer risk associated with the financial ability of ubs to repurchase the ars beginning june   based on level data available at december  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock compensation topic asc 
asc requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
during the year ended december   we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of for grants issued to senior management and for grants issued to our employees in determining the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
upon review of our actual rate of forfeitures since the adoption of asc  and in consideration of the reduction in force that took place during  we changed our estimated forfeiture rate for employee grants in from to 
this change in estimate was recorded as a cumulative catch up adjustment of approximately  and as a reduction in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  we expect our forfeiture rate on future grants to decrease to historical levels 
during the year ended december   we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of for grants issued to all of our employees in determining the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents upon review of our actual rate of forfeitures since the adoption of asc  and in consideration of the reduction in force that took place during  we changed our estimated forfeiture rate for employee grants in from to 
this change in estimate was recorded as a cumulative catch up adjustment of approximately  and as a reduction in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
due to our initial public offering in december  we believe there is not adequate information on the volatility of our own shares 
as such  our estimated expected stock price volatility is based on a weighted average of our own historic volatility and the average volatility of other similar companies in the same industry 
we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry 
our expected term of options granted since adoption of asc was derived from the short cut method described in sec s staff asc the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with asc and the equity topic  asc income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
asc recognizes tax assets and liabilities for the cumulative effect of all temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertain tax positions following the provisions of asc asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu or update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and early adoption is permitted 
a company may elect  but will not be required  to adopt the amendments in asu no 
retrospectively for all prior periods 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or statement of operations 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
for fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires new 
table of contents disclosures for transfers in and out of level and and activity in level this update also clarifies existing disclosures for level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the level disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those years 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of money market funds  state and municipal government obligations  some of which are auction rate securities  commercial paper  federal agency notes and corporate obligations and treasuries 
the securities  other than money market funds and auction rate securities  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all investments other than auction rate securities mature by may  these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our fixed income investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio in available for sale debt securities 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  investments at fair value weighted average interest rate we hold investments in auction rate securities with underlying assets that generally consist of student loans  which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed  with one exception 
to date we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
during the year ended december   certain investments in ars were successfully called at full par value and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we adjusted the carrying amount of our ars to estimated fair market value in accordance with the fair value measurements topic asc if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further or we experience any additional rating downgrades on any investments in the portfolio  we may incur further other than temporary impairments  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
as of december  and  we held million and million  respectively  at par value  of auction rate securities investments 
as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources above  the auction rate securities are managed by ubs 
on november   we agreed to accept the rights from ubs 
the rights permit us to sell  or put  our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise our ars rights and put our auction rate securities to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights  therefore  we have reclassified our ars and 
table of contents associated rights to short term investments and related financial instruments as of december  we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars will be mostly offset by the changes in the fair value of the related rights  both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis 
while the auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments  until we exercise our rights on june   we believe that the ars failures will not have an impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
foreign currency exchange 
a significant portion of our operations is conducted through operations in countries other than the united states 
revenues from our international operations that were recorded in us dollars represented approximately of our total international revenues during the year ended december  substantially all of the remainder of our revenues was from sales in euros  british pounds  japanese yen  chinese yuan and south korean won 
since we conduct our business in us dollars  our main exposure  if any  results from changes in the exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked 
therefore  we believe that the potential loss that would result from an increase or decrease in the exchange rate is immaterial to our business and net assets
