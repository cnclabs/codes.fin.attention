item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under any of these credit facilities 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our other long term debt obligations  as substantially all of these obligations have fixed interest rates 
we have operations in many foreign locations  and  as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets 
in order to manage the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we attempt to hedge those risks with foreign currency derivative instruments 
historically  we have hedged those risks with foreign currency forward contracts 
we have recently hedged some of those risks with foreign currency option contracts 
we do not enter into speculative derivative positions
