critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  sales and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
in addition  from time to time  the company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  the company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in the company s sales returns  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
the company s primary sales program  the preferred retailer program  offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period  as well as potential rebates and discounts  for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
under this program  qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased 
discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale 
for rebates  the company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases 
the estimate is based on the historical level of purchases  adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels 
the estimated year end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels  as necessary 
the preferred retailer program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year end 
in addition to the 
table of contents preferred retailer program  the company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature 
historically the company s actual costs related to its preferred retailer program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates 
revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws 
the company s gift cards have no expiration 
to determine when redemption is remote  the company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used and compares that information with historical redemption trends 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues 
however  if the company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from million at december  to million during the year ended december  revenues from course credits in connection with the use of upro gps on course range finders are deferred when purchased and recognized when customers download the course credits for usage 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
the calculation of the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and pricing  regulatory usga and r a rule changes  the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  the company may need to increase its inventory allowance  which could significantly adversely affect the company s operating results 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant 
table of contents and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  the timing of the impairment test  and the asset s residual value  if any 
to determine fair value  the company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate  quoted market prices  royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
during the second half of and into  general economic and stock market conditions worsened considerably and the company s stock price declined significantly during this period 
during the second quarter of  the company s market capitalization fell below its recorded book value 
as a result  during the second quarter of  the company performed an impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
based on the results of the impairment analysis  no impairment was identified as of june  in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets held throughout the year 
based on this testing  there was no impairment as of december  warranty policy the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
the company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period  where little or no claims experience may exist 
experience has shown that warranty rates can vary between product models 
therefore  the company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long term historical warranty rates until sufficient data is available 
as actual model specific rates become available  the company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
historically  the company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation 
however  if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s warranty obligation  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
income taxes current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis 
table of contents of an asset or liability computed pursuant to asc topic and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
pursuant to asc topic  the company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to pay such additional taxes 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than likelihood of being sustained 
the company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the united states and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
the company  in consultation with its tax advisors  bases its income tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the income tax returns  however  are subject to routine audits by the various federal  state and international taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company files its income tax returns 
as part of these reviews  a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the tax positions taken by the company 
the resolution of any disagreements over the company s tax positions often involves complex issues and may span multiple years  particularly if litigation is involved 
the ultimate resolution of these tax positions is often uncertain until the audit is complete and any disagreements are resolved 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company therefore accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statute of limitations  or upon occurrence of other events 
historically  additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the company s expectations 
information regarding income taxes is contained in note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with asc topic  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
asc topic further requires a reduction in share based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate used by the company is based on historical forfeiture trends 
if actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the company s expected stock price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected life of an option and the risk free rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected dividend yield and the expected option life 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 

table of contents the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively restricted stock based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded 
compensation expense related to unvested shares is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
phantom stock units are a form of share based awards that are indexed to the company s stock and are settled in cash 
they are accounted for as liabilities  which are initially measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the phantom stock awarded 
the liabilities are subsequently remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each interim reporting period through the settlement date of the awards 
total compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
from time to time the company may grant performance share units to certain employees  which are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the company s performance against specified performance targets over a three year period from the date of grant 
the estimated fair value of the performance share units is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the estimated number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period 
total compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the company uses forecasted performance metrics to estimate the number of performance share units to be issued as well as approval from the compensation and management succession committee of the board of directors 
the company s performance against the specified performance targets is reviewed quarterly and expense is adjusted as the company s actual and forecasted performance changes

as discussed in note segment information to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income expense not utilized by management in determining segment profitability 
in most of the company s key markets  the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis 
weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year round  except in a few markets  with many of the company s on course customers closing for the cold weather months 
the company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in general  during the first quarter  the company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season 
this initial sell in generally continues into the second quarter 
the company s second quarter sales are also significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter 
the company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season 
the company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the company s key markets 
however  fourth quarter sales can be affected 
table of contents from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year 
this seasonality  and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations  can be affected by many factors  including the timing of new product introductions 
in general  however  because of this seasonality  a majority of the company s sales and most  if not all  of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year 
approximately half of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states and is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
for reporting purposes  transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into us dollars based upon applicable foreign currency exchange rates

competition for this limited pool of consumer dollars resulted in a very competitive marketplace and an aggressive pricing and promotional environment 
furthermore  retailers were cautious throughout the year as to the amount of inventory they carried and the amount of products they were willing to re order 
as a result of these conditions  the company s sales for declined compared to during the first half of the year  these unfavorable conditions were more severe than the company had originally anticipated and jeopardized the company s continued compliance with the financial covenants under its primary credit facility 
as a result  in june  the company completed a private offering of its preferred stock which resulted in net proceeds of million 
the company used these proceeds to pay down amounts outstanding under its credit facility  which allowed the company to remain in compliance with the financial covenants for the remainder of the year 
the company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of million and no amounts outstanding under its credit facility 
the preferred stock proceeds also allowed the company to take a balanced approach during in navigating this challenging environment 
the company balanced managing its expenses closely operating expenses decreased in compared to while at the same time investing in growth initiatives such as the company s newly acquired upro business and expansion into and additional investments in emerging markets such as india  china  thailand and malaysia

table of contents hedging to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of the company s international subsidiaries into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts and put and call option contracts foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge transactions that are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  japanese yen  canadian dollars  australian dollars and korean won 
for most currencies  the company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the company transacts significant amounts of business 
foreign currency exchange contracts are used only to meet the company s objectives of offsetting gains and losses from foreign currency exchange exposures with gains and losses from the contracts used to hedge them in order to reduce volatility of earnings 
the extent to which the company s hedging activities mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates varies based upon many factors  including the amount of transactions being hedged 
the company generally only hedges a limited portion of its international transactions

as part of the company s risk management procedure  a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values 
the sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which the company was exposed at december  through its foreign currency exchange contracts 
the estimated maximum one day loss from the company s foreign currency exchange contracts  calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above  is million at december  the portion of the estimated loss associated with foreign currency exchange contracts that offset the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is million at december  and would impact earnings 
the company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency exchange contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors
