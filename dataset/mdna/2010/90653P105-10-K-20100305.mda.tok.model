company overview union drilling  inc provides contract land drilling services and equipment  primarily to natural gas producers 
in addition to our drilling rigs  we provide the drilling crews and most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs 
we commenced operations in with drilling rigs and related equipment acquired from an entity providing contract drilling services under the name union drilling 
through a combination of acquisitions and new rig construction  we have increased the size of our fleet to marketed land drilling rigs 
we presently focus our operations in selected natural gas production regions in the united states  primarily the fort worth basin in north texas  the arkoma basin in oklahoma and arkansas and throughout the appalachian basin 
we do not invest in oil and natural gas properties 
we completed several transactions from through which increased the size of our rig fleet  thus enhancing our ability to serve our customers 
two acquisitions in provided us with unconventional natural gas contract drilling operations in north texas and the arkoma basin 
we subsequently purchased additional rigs  including newly constructed rigs  and have devoted significant capital expenditures to upgrade other rigs in our fleet for unconventional drilling 
contractual commitments were obtained from our customers in recent years to substantiate these rig purchases and significant rig upgrades 
at various times  we remove rigs from our marketed fleet  and the components are made available for use on other rigs 
we are also in the process of outfitting seven of our rigs with walking or skidding systems which allow for multiple wells to be drilled in a single location to provide efficiency and to reduce the overall environmental impact 
moreover  we continue to enhance our fleet of drilling rigs with technological capabilities through upgrades  acquisitions or new rig construction in order to improve drilling productivity and reduce total well costs for our customers 
key indicators of financial performance for management key performance measurements in our industry are rig utilization  revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day 
revenue days for each rig are days when the rig is earning revenues under a contract  which is usually a period from the date the rig begins moving to the drilling location until the rig is released from the contract 
we compute rig utilization rates by dividing revenue days by total available days during a period 
total available days are the number of calendar days during the period that we have owned the marketed rig 

table of contents the following table summarizes management s key indicators of financial performance for the three years ended december  years ended december  revenue days average number of marketed rigs marketed rig utilization rates revenue per revenue day operating expenses per revenue day as a result of the decline in natural gas prices commencing in the second half of  overall demand for drilling services correspondingly decreased 
consequently  we experienced a drop in our marketed rig utilization during compared to which primarily affected certain of our smaller rigs and caused our revenue days to decrease 
revenue per revenue day for was favorably impacted by tolling agreements that we entered into in late march related to two rigs for which the operator elected to pay a stand by or tolling rate rather than to operate them 
tolling rigs provide revenue without contributing any revenue days  and therefore  increase the calculated revenue per revenue day amount 
for  these tolling rigs increased revenue per revenue day by and operating expense per revenue day by in addition  the increase in revenue per revenue day in was partially attributable to three of the four rigs that we deployed in the first half of under term contracts the fourth rig is on tolling and decreased utilization of our smaller rigs which earn a lower dayrate than our larger rigs 
offsetting these increases was the unfavorable impact of term contracts with higher dayrates that expired during and were reset at lower dayrates from a depressed market 
revenue days increased slightly in compared to primarily due to four new large rigs deployed in the latter part of the third quarter of this increase in revenue days was partially offset by the continued decline in demand for smaller rigs in our fleet  resulting in the slight decrease in the marketed rig utilization rates 
the increase in revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day in compared to was primarily related to the new rigs placed into service during the latter part of the third quarter of in addition  operating expenses per revenue day in grew more rapidly than revenue per revenue day due to higher employment costs  repairs and maintenance  fuel and supplies which we were not able to fully pass through to our customers 
we devote substantial resources to maintaining and upgrading our rig fleet 
on a regular basis  we remove certain rigs from service to perform upgrades 
in the short term  these actions result in fewer revenue days and slightly lower utilization  however  in the long term  we believe the upgrades will help the marketability of the rigs and improve their operating performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue and cost recognition 
we generate revenue principally by drilling wells for natural gas producers under daywork or footage contracts  which provide for the drilling of single or multiple well projects 
revenues on daywork contracts are recognized based on the days worked at the dayrate each contract specifies 
mobilization fees are recognized as the related drilling services are provided 
we recognize revenues on footage contracts based on the footage drilled for the applicable accounting period 
expenses are recognized based on the costs incurred during that same accounting period 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses are recorded as revenues and direct expenses 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers based on their financial information  if available  information obtained from major industry suppliers  and our past experiences  if any  with the customer 
in some instances  we require new customers to make prepayments 
we typically invoice our customers semi monthly during the performance of the contracts and upon completion of the contract  with payment due within days 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
any allowance established is subject to judgment and estimates made by management 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  our assessment of our customers current abilities to pay obligations to us and the condition of the general economy and the oil and gas industry as a whole 
our bad debt expense was million  million and  for  and  respectively 
we write off specific accounts receivable 
table of contents when we determine they are uncollectible 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable for two customers 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable  primarily for four customers  three of which subsequently declared bankruptcy 
we are pursuing our claims in the bankruptcy proceedings 
at december  and  our unbilled receivables totaled million and million  respectively  all of which relates to the revenue recognized  but not yet billed  on contracts in progress at december  and  respectively 
the million decrease at december  compared to december  is due to lower utilization and increased progress billings during  and the absence of a million contract settlement payment we received in january asset impairments 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review would be any significant negative trends in the industry or the general economy  our contract revenue rates  our rig utilization rates  cash flows generated from operating our drilling rigs  existence of term drilling contracts  current and future oil and natural gas prices  industry analysts outlook for the oil and gas industry and their view of our customers access to capital and the trends in the price of used drilling equipment observed by our management 
if a review of our long lived assets indicates that our carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is made to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
cash flows are estimated by management considering factors such as expectations of future industry trends and the impact on dayrates  utilization and operating expenses  historical performance of the asset  the remaining expected life of the asset  any cash investment required to make the asset more marketable  suitability  specification and size of the rig  terminal value  as well as overall competitive dynamics 
use of different assumptions could result in an impairment charge different from that reported 
during  business conditions were challenging for the drilling industry  rivaling one of the worst contractions the industry has seen since the s  requiring us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
based on our assessment  million of impairment was recognized for the year ended december  estimated fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs level based on both an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach was calculated as the estimated discounted future net cash flows assumed to be received from the operation of the asset over its useful life and a terminal value  while market was based on external industry data for similar equipment 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of nonfinancial assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels 
in the event that current market conditions do not improve  the company may be required to record additional impairment of its long lived assets in the future  and such an impairment expense  even though non cash  could be material and negatively impact our earnings 
depreciation 
we provide for depreciation of our drilling rigs  transportation and other equipment on a straight line method over useful lives that we have estimated and that range from two to years 
unlike depreciation based on units of production  our approach to depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle or when utilization changes 
we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis despite the fact that our revenues and operating costs may vary with changes in utilization levels 
our estimates of the useful lives of our drilling  transportation and other equipment are based on our experience in the drilling industry with similar equipment 
intangible assets 
our customer list is amortized over the estimated benefit period which was initially determined to be years  but in  was revised to years based on actual historical customer turnover 
this change in estimate  from years remaining at december  to years remaining at december   increased the annual amortization from  to  deferred taxes 
we record deferred taxes for the basis difference in our property and equipment between financial reporting and tax reporting purposes and other costs such as compensation  employee benefits and other accrued liabilities which are deductible in different periods for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
for property and equipment  basis differences arise from differences in depreciation periods and methods and the value of assets acquired in a business acquisition where we acquire the stock of an entity rather than its assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate the various components of our drilling rigs and refurbishments over two to years  while federal income tax rules require that we depreciate drilling rigs and refurbishments over five years 
in and  tax depreciation also included bonus depreciation allowed as a result of the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the economic stimulus act of  respectively 
therefore  in the earlier years of our ownership of a drilling rig  our tax depreciation exceeds our financial reporting depreciation  resulting in our recording deferred tax liabilities on this depreciation difference 
in later years  financial reporting depreciation exceeds tax depreciation  and the deferred tax liability begins to reverse 

table of contents accrued workers compensation 
the company accrues for costs under our workers compensation insurance program in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we have a deductible of  per covered accident under our workers compensation insurance 
our insurance policies require us to maintain letters of credit to cover our deductible payments 
as of december  and  we satisfied this requirement with letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
we accrue for these costs as claims are incurred based on cost estimates established for each claim by the insurance companies providing the administrative services for processing the claims  including estimates for incurred but not reported claims  claims paid directly by us  administrative costs associated with these claims and our historical experience with these types of claims 
in addition  as needed  we accrue the estimated workers compensation premium payable to ohio  a monopolistic state  when our rigs work in that state 
some of our employees engaged in our texas field operations were previously considered to be shared employees 
under this arrangement  we paid a fee for certain human resource functions  including the workers compensation and payroll liabilities  to be assumed by the third party professional employer organization peo 
this peo arrangement in texas was terminated effective august   and such employees are now covered under our workers compensation insurance program 
stock based compensation 
compensation cost resulting from share based payment awards are measured at fair value and recognized in general and administrative expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of million million net of tax  million million net of tax  and   net of tax  respectively 
total unamortized stock based compensation was approximately million at december   and will be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
any tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is included as a cash inflow from financing activities on the statement of cash flows 
estimating the fair value of options granted requires us to utilize valuation models and to establish several underlying assumptions 
the fair value of option grants was estimated using the black scholes option valuation model based on the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate expected life years years years dividend yield expected volatility the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected lives of the options are determined based on the company s expectations of individual option holders anticipated behavior and the term of the option 
the company has not paid out dividends historically  thus  the dividend yield is estimated at zero percent 
volatility is based upon price performance of the company and a peer company  as the company does not have a sufficient historical price base to determine potential volatility over the term of the issued options 
results of operations our operations primarily consist of drilling natural gas wells for our customers under either daywork contracts and  to a lesser extent  footage contracts 
contract terms we offer generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment used  the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and the overall demand for rigs in our markets 
our contracts generally provide for the drilling of a specified number of wells or a specific period of time for which the rig will be under contract 

table of contents statements of operations analysis the following table provides selected information about our operations for the years ended december   and in thousands 
years ended december  revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization impairment charge general and administrative expense interest expense other income and gain on disposal of assets effective income tax rate revenues 
the million  or decrease in revenues in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in our marketed rig utilization  from in to in  as a result of the decline in the level of us land based natural gas exploration and development activity 
our revenues grew by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to million of revenue related to four new large rigs being deployed in the latter part of the third quarter of due to their greater capacity  these new rigs earned a higher day rate than our smaller rigs 
operating expenses 
the million  or decrease in operating expenses in compared to was also due to the decrease in our marketed rig utilization 
employment costs  fuel  supplies and repairs and maintenance costs decreased as a result of having a greater number of idled rigs compared to the prior year 
operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the operating costs related to the four new rigs deployed in the latter part of the third quarter of were million 
the remaining increase was due to increases in wages  vehicle and fuel expense  supplies and repairs and maintenance costs 
depreciation and amortization 
the million  or increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to was primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets 
during the first half of  rig purchases and capital equipment upgrades were added to our fleet as part of our capital spending program which enhanced our fleet capabilities 
capital expenditures were million in depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in compared to due to the increase in depreciable assets 
capital expenditures for rig purchases and capital equipment upgrades were million in  of which million represented construction in progress at december  impairment charge 
during  million of impairment charges were recognized related to certain of our long lived assets to write down the carrying value of these assets to fair value 
the million impairment charge in is related to goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses 
the million  or decrease in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as decreased employment costs and other cost reductions in response to the decrease in operations 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to as a result of the deteriorating economy in late and its impact on specific customers  our provision for doubtful accounts increased million in payroll expense increased million primarily due to additional wages to professional and administrative employees and other stock based compensation expense increased approximately  an additional  increase related to safety expenses  other consulting fees and property taxes 

table of contents interest expense 
there was no significant change in interest expense in compared to interest expense decreased approximately  in compared to  primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and higher capitalization of interest related to construction in progress during other income and gain on disposal of assets 
the  decrease in other income and gain on disposal of assets is primarily due to fewer gains on disposal of drillpipe as a result of lower utilization in in addition  includes a  gain on involuntary conversions related to rig damages 
other income and gain on disposal of assets decreased  in compared to primarily due to the gains on sale of various utility vehicles at auction during the second quarter of  and partially offset by a  gain on involuntary conversions related to rig damages in taxes 
our effective income tax rates of  and for  and  respectively  differ from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the non deductible goodwill impairment charge in  state income taxes and permanent book tax differences such as those associated with deduction limitation on per diem meals expense  the domestic manufacturing deduction and stock based compensation 
see note to our financial statements for further information on our income taxes 
at both december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  these losses may be carried forward for years and will begin to expire in state net operating loss carryforwards at december  and were million and million  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards vary as to carryforward period and will begin to expire in  depending upon the jurisdiction where applied 
in  a valuation allowance of  was established for state net operating loss carryforwards in states where utilization is uncertain due to lack of forecasted future operations 
based upon results and forecasted future operations  we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining amounts will be realized 
the company s  and us federal income and employment tax returns are currently under examination by the irs although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in our tax provisions and accruals 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have historically generated sufficient cash flow to meet our requirements for debt service and equipment expenditures excluding major business and asset acquisitions 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in rig utilization in the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the higher operating costs in our cash flow from operations primarily was used to invest in new machinery and equipment as well as for capitalized upgrades to our fleet 
during  and  cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the completion of our capital spending program 
cash flow used in financing activities was million for in june  the company completed a public offering consisting of million shares of newly issued common stock at a price of per share 
proceeds to the company  net of underwriting discounts and other fees and expenses  were million and were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
in the third quarter of  we received refunds from the irs of million for taxes paid related to bonus depreciation claimed on our return 
these refunds were also used to pay down indebtedness on our revolving credit facility 
in june  we used million in borrowings on our credit facility to pay off certain notes payable for equipment with interest rates higher than the revolving credit facility 
in addition  in january  we purchased  shares of common stock for million under a repurchase program 
for the year ended december   our cash flow from financing activities was million  consisting primarily of the million increase in our net borrowings on our revolving credit and security agreement and other debt  and partially offset by million used for treasury stock purchases during the fourth quarter of the increase in our loan balance on our credit facility from 
table of contents million at december  to million at december  was primarily the result of the excess of our cash paid for capital expenditures of million over our million cash flow from operations 
during  our cash flow used in financing activities was million  primarily due to the million net debt repayments and partially offset by million in stock option exercise proceeds and related tax benefit 
we believe cash generated by our operations and our ability to borrow the currently unused portion of our revolving credit facility of approximately million  after reductions for approximately million outstanding letters of credit as of december   should allow us to meet our routine financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
sources of capital resources our rig fleet has grown from rigs in to marketed rigs at december  we have financed this growth with a combination of debt and equity financing  as well as operating cash flows 
at december   our total debt to total capital was approximately see note of the financial statements  included in
