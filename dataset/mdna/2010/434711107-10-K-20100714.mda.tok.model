we were incorporated in hawaii in march  as pacific energy group  inc and changed our name to hoku scientific  inc 
in july in december  we were reincorporated in delaware 
in march  we changed our name from hoku scientific  inc to hoku corporation 
we have historically focused our efforts on the design and development of fuel cell technologies  including our hoku membrane electrode assemblies  or meas  and hoku membranes 
in may  we announced our plans to form an integrated photovoltaic  or pv  module business  and our plans to manufacture polysilicon  a primary material used in the manufacture of pv modules 
in fiscal  we reorganized our business into three business units hoku materials  hoku solar and hoku fuel cells 
in february and march  we incorporated hoku materials  inc and hoku solar  inc  respectively  as wholly owned subsidiaries to operate our polysilicon and pv system installation businesses  respectively 
during fiscal  we had limited activity in our fuel cell business  as such  during fiscal  we plan to furt her assess our opportunities to grow this business or whether it may be appropriate to discontinue operations in hoku fuel cells 
hoku materials hoku materials was incorporated to manufacture polysilicon  a key material used in photovoltaic  or pv  modules 
in may  we commenced construction of our planned polysilicon manufacturing facility in pocatello  idaho  which would be capable of producing  metric tons of polysilicon per year  or the polysilicon plant 
at this level of capacity  the estimated construction cost for our polysilicon plant is to million 
this estimate is based on our discussion with vendors and ongoing adjustments of certain design elements  however  changes in costs  modifications in construction timelines  delays in our construction schedule and other factors could cause the actual cost to significantly exceed our estimate 
any significant increase in the cost to complete the polysilicon plant could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we installed the first six out of a planned total order of siemens process reactors at the polysilicon plant and in april successfully produced polysilicon using two of the six reactors 
we produced the material after completing a comprehensive system commissioning protocol  which culminated in deposition runs in a select number of our installed polysilicon reactors 
the primary purpose of the testing was to confirm system integrity and validate operating procedures 
contingent on securing additional financing  we expect our first commercial shipment to occur in the third quarter of calendar year we intend to ramp up production throughout the second half of calendar year and into calendar year  when we expect to reach full production capability 
we expect this schedule will allow us to meet all delivery obligations to our current customers  however  there are no assurances that we will not need to revise this schedule 
hoku materials incurred an operating loss of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  which is primarily comprised of costs related to our initial polysilicon production  payroll  including stock compensation  professional fees and travel expenses 
in addition  as of march   hoku materials has capitalized million related to construction costs for the polysilicon plant and had received million in customer deposits as prepayments on long term polysilicon supply agreements  which excludes million in equity contributions through our financing arrangement with tianwei 
in december  we completed a financing transaction with tianwei in which we issued to tianwei  shares of our common stock  representing of our fully diluted outstanding shares 
tianwei is restricted from transferring directly or indirectly  or  of the shares to any third party until the first anniversary of the closing date of the agreement 
we also granted to tianwei a warrant to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock 
the terms of the warrant include i a per share exercise price equal to  ii an exercise period of seven years  and iii provision for a cashless  net issue exercise 
the existing polysilicon supply agreements with tianwei were amended such that million of an aggregate of million in secured prepayments previously paid by tianwei to us was converted into the  shares of our common stock 
the amended supply agreements also provide for a reduced price at which tianwei purchases polysilicon by approximately in each year of the ten year agreement 
tianwei also agreed to loan us million through china construction bank  as agent 
in january and march  we received the million and million  respectively  in loan proceeds 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we have pledged a security interest in all of our assets to tianwei 
in may  we entered into a million credit agreement with the new york branch of china merchants bank 
we borrowed the entire million in may and this principal amount of the loan and any unpaid interest must be paid in full two years after the effective date of the credit agreement 
we may prepay the loan at any time without penalty 
funds provided pursuant to the credit agreement are for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures related to the polysilicon plant 
the loan under the credit agreement is secured by a standby letter of credit drawn by tianwei in chengdu  china and issued to china merchants bank  as collateral 
the loan will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the libor rate for the applicable interest period plus o r  if we elect  any portion of the loan that is not less than million may bear interest at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest announced by the lender as its prime rate 
we are also assessed a facility fee of percent of the total loan amount  or  per annum 
interest is payable quarterly  and the million in loan proceeds is due in may with no penalty for earlier prepayment of principal 
in june  we entered into a million credit agreement with the new york branch of china construction bank 
the agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million  which must be borrowed within days of our satisfying certain customary closing conditions 
these closing conditions have subsequently been satisfied 
the principal amount of the loan and any unpaid interest thereon must be paid in full by june we may prepay the loan  in whole or in part  at any time without penalty 
funds provided pursuant to the credit agreement are for the purpose of completing the development and construction of the polysilicon plant 
the loan under the credit agreement is secured by a standby letter of credit drawn by tianwei and i ssued by the sichuan branch of china construction bank in favor of the new york branch of china construction bank 
the loan will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the libor rate for the applicable interest period plus or  if we elect  and if the bank agrees  any portion of the loan that is not less than  may bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest prime rate as published in the money rates column of the eastern edition of the wall street journal from time to time 
we will pay a facility fee of  and a commitment fee  which will be determined by multiplying the average daily balance of the un utilized portion of the maximum loan amount during the day available period by per annum 
in connection with the credit agreements with the new york branch of china merchants bank and the new york branch of the china construction bank  we agreed to reimburse tianwei for interest  fees and expenses incurred pursuant to  or in connection with negotiating or performing  the stand by letter of credits tianwei drawn to secure our obligations  which amounts are unknown at this time 
as of june   we have funded approximately million of our polysilicon plant 
after considering our recently secured credit line for million and million in expected prepayments  we still need to raise an additional million to complete the construction of our polysilicon plant based upon our current estimate of million to complete construction 
we plan on raising this money through one or more subsequent debt and or equity offerings and possibly prepayments from new customer contracts 
tianwei has also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to assist us in obtaining additional financing that may be required by us to construct and operate the polysilicon plant 
hoku solar our goal is to be a leading provider in pv system installations 
we plan to continue to focus on designing  engineering and installing turnkey pv systems and related services in hawaii using solar modules purchased from third party suppliers 
revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal revenue for fiscal was primarily comprised of pv system installations and related services for namalu llc  nan  inc and henkels mccoy and the sale of electricity to the state of hawaii department of transportation 
revenue for fiscal was primarily comprised of pv system installations and related services for paradise beverages  inc  and resco  inc  and the resale of solar inventory 
we are also exploring the feasibility of establishing an investment fund to provide dedicated financing for pv systems to be installed and operated in the state of hawaii by us 
we have signed a non binding letter of intent with tianwei to begin the process of structuring this solar project financing fund that could be as large as million  which would provide funding for the installation and operation of large commercial  industrial  and utility scale pv projects via power purchase agreements  or ppas 
hoku solar incurred an operating loss of million and  in fiscal and  respectively  primarily reflecting higher expenses  which mainly consisted of payroll  including stock compensation  and professional fees 
hoku fuel cells under the name hoku fuel cells  we operate our fuel cell business  which has designed  developed and manufactured membranes and membrane electrode assemblies  or meas  for proton exchange membrane  or pem  fuel cells 
hoku meas are designed for the residential primary power  commercial back up  and automotive hydrogen fuel cell markets 
to date  none of our customers have commercially deployed products incorporating hoku meas or hoku membranes  and we have not sold any products commercially 
we do not have any current material fuel cell contracts 
we have selectively pursued patent applications in order to protect our technology  inventions and improvements related to our fuel cell products  however  during fiscal  we had limited activity in our fuel cell business  and as such  during fiscal  we plan to further assess our opportunities to grow this business or whether it may be appropriate to discontinue operations in hoku fuel cells 
as of march   hoku fuel cells had insignificant activity primarily associated with prosecuting patent applications to protect our technology  inventions and improvements related to our fuel cell products 
financial operations review revenue during fiscal  we derived primarily all of our revenue through pv system installations and related services  the resale of solar inventory  and the sale of electricity 
we expect that all of our revenue will be derived through the same sources as in fiscal  until the second quarter of fiscal  when hoku materials is expected to generate revenue through the sale of polysilicon manufactured at our planned polysilicon production facility in pocatello  idaho 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of supplies and materials  subcontractor costs  and employee compensation  including stock based compensation 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase on an absolute basis as our pv system installations increase and we begin selling polysilicon 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  including stock based compensation for executive and administrative personnel 
other significant costs include utilities  insurance costs  and professional fees for accounting  legal and consulting services 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase by a significant factor as our pv system installations increase and we begin selling polysilicon 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation  for research and development personnel 
other significant costs include facility costs  the cost of supplies and materials and depreciation 
we expense research and development expenses as they are incurred 
although our research and development expenses have decreased significantly since we reduced our investment in our fuel cell business  we expect to invest in the research and development of new solar products  which will result in a significant increase in our research and development expenses in the future 
consolidated results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of hoku corporation and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
fiscal year vs

cost of revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the cost of revenue for fiscal and related primarily to pv system installation contracts 
cost of revenue primarily consisted of materials  subcontractor expenses and employee compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to  related to the initial polysilicon production demonstration completed in april  higher payroll expenses of  the lower application of other direct and indirect charges to customer contracts of  and retention payments for officers and other key employees of  in addition  the increase in fiscal expenses included  in depreciation primarily related to the pv systems installed for the hawaii state department of transportation  compensation to our board directors of  rent for our corporate and warehouse facilities of  and maintenance costs related to our polysilicon facilities of  these higher expenses in fiscal were offset by decreases in stock based compensation of  and professional fees of  research and development expenses 
we had no research and development fees in fiscal and interest and other income 
interest and other income was  for fiscal  compared to interest and other income of  for fiscal interest and other income for fiscal was primarily comprised of the reversal of  of prior accruals for general excise tax reserves due to statute limitations and a foreign currency transaction gain of  related to euros based invoices 
in addition  the fiscal income related to gains on the sale of fuel cell equipment of  interest income of  and a hawaii state tax refund of  interest and other income for fiscal were primarily comprised of a gain on the sale of our fee simple interest in our corporate headquarters of  interest income of  the reversal of  of prior accruals for general excise tax reserves due to statute limitations  and the sale of fuel cell equipment of  offset by losses related to our foreign currency euro forward contracts of  fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue 
revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal revenue for fiscal was primarily comprised of pv system installations and related services for paradise beverages  inc  and resco  inc  and the resale of solar inventory 
revenue for fiscal was comprised of pv system installations primarily from contracts with paradise beverages  bank of hawaii and hardware hawaii and fuel cell revenue from contracts with the us navy 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the cost of revenue for fiscal related primarily to pv system installation contracts and related services compared to revenue primarily from pv system installation contracts and related services and from fuel cell contracts with the u 
s navy in fiscal cost of revenue primarily consisted of materials  subcontractor expenses and employee compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million was primarily due to the executive officers declining cash bonuses in accordance with the fiscal year executive incentive compensation plan compared to million in cash bonuses provided in accordance with the fiscal year executive incentive compensation plan 
in addition  there were decreases in professional fees consisting principally of legal  accounting  consulting and other service fees of  and the recognition of losses in fiscal on the resale of solar cells and write down of solar and fuel cell equipment of  and  respectively 
furthermore  there was a higher application of other direct and indirect charges to customer contracts in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulting in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  the decrease was offset by increases in payroll  which includes stock compensation  of  rent of  interest and bank loan expenses of  and marketing expenses of  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease of  was primarily due to a shift in business strategy from fuel cells to solar 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was  for fiscal  compared to interest and other income of million for the same period in fiscal interest and other income for fiscal was primarily comprised of a gain on the sale of our fee simple interest in our real property and improvements of our corporate headquarters of  and interest income of  in addition  the income was related to the reversal in prior accruals for general excise tax reserves due to statute limitations of  and the sale of fuel cell equipment of  the income was offset by losses related to our foreign currency euro forward contracts of  interest and other income for fisca l were primarily comprised of interest income of  and the sale of fuel cell equipment of  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carry ing value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are also described in note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue from polysilicon and pv system installations and the resale of pv system installation inventory is recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
this requires us to assess at what point our systems are deemed to be installed and all other criteria have been met 
when management determines that such criteria have been met  revenue is recognized 
we have also provided testing and engineering services to customers pursuant to milestone based contracts that are not multi element arrangements 
these contracts sometimes provided for periodic invoicing as we completed a milestone 
customer acceptance is usually required prior to invoicing 
we reco gnized revenue for these arrangements under the completed contract method 
under the completed contract method  we deferred the contract fulfillment costs and any advance payments received from the customer and recognized the costs and revenue in our statement of operations once the contract was complete and the final customer acceptance  if required  had been obtained 
while customer acceptance supports that our services have been rendered and accepted  we will still assess whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
when management determines that such criteria have been met  revenue is recognized 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the fair value method  whereby the fair value of stock options and or restricted stock awards granted to our employees and non employees is determined using the black scholes pricing model 
the black scholes pricing model requires the input of several subjective assumptions including the expected life of the option restricted stock award and the expected volatility of the option restricted stock award at the time the option restricted award is granted 
the fair value of our option restricted award  as determined by the black scholes pricing model  is expensed over the requisite service period  which is generally five years for stock options and varies between two and five years for restricted stock awards 
prior to our initial public offering  there was an absence of an active market for our common stock  and therefore our board of directors estimated the market value of our common stock on the date of grant of the stock option based on several factors  including progress and milestones achieved in our business and sales of our preferred stock 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations from a valuation specialist during this period 
subsequent to our initial public offering  the market value is based on the public market for our common stock 
due to our limited operating history  we have assumed a volatility of based on competitive benchmarks and management s judgment and an expected life based on the average of the typical vesting period and the option s contractual life which ranges from to years 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of our stock options and restricted stock awards represent our management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of the estimated fair value of our stock options and restricted stock awards 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options and shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
furthermore  this accounting estimate is reasonably likely to change from period t o period as further stock options and restricted stock awards are granted and adjustments are made for stock option and restricted stock awards forfeitures and cancellations 
in accordance with fasb asc  we do not record any deferred stock based compensation on our balance sheet for our stock options and restricted stock awards 
we expect to incur an aggregate of  of future stock based compensation expense and associated with unvested stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding as of march  through fiscal as set forth in the table below 
we expect that some of the amounts noted below will be included as costs of delivering our products and services and as such  will be deferred and recognized as cost of revenue in conjunction with the recognition of revenue 
fiscal year ending march  total in thousands we expect our stock based compensation expense from restricted stock awards to increase as we expand our operations and hire new employees 
these expenses will increase our overall expenses and may increase our losses for the foreseeable future 
as a restricted stock award is a non cash expense  it will not have any effect upon our liquidity or capital resources 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as of march   primarily all of our long lived assets related to the construction in progress of our polysilicon plant and pv systems 
in accounting for long lived assets  we must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of our long lived assets  we primarily rely on our own industry experience  discussion with our customers and vendors  and other available marketplace information 
we also evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
notes payable and warrants tianwei financing transaction we account for the warrant and debt based on their relative fair values in proportion to the loan proceeds 
the fair value of the warrant was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes pricing model requires the input of several subjective assumptions including the expected life of the warrant and the expected volatility of the warrant at the time the warrant was granted 
the fair value of the debt was based on the present value of cash flows at the estimated market interest rate 
the assumptions used in calculating the warrant and debt represent our management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in estimating market interest rate  we relied on available marketplace information of similar transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which is now referenced as fasb asc under the new codification system 
the fasb accounting standards codification codification has become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the company adopted the new standard  effective september  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events  currently referenced as fasb asc  which requires that the company specify the period after the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
in preparing the accompanying unaudited financial statements  the company s management has evaluated subsequent events through july   which is the date that the financial statements were filed 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant net losses since inception and we have relied on our ability to fund our operations principally through both registered and unregistered offerings of our securities and prepayments on long term polysilicon contracts 
even if we are successful in securing additional long term polysilicon contracts that could provide additional prepayments  and our existing customers fulfill their obligations to make additional prepayments when due of which there can be no assurances  we will still need to seek additional financing to complete our polysilicon plant 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million and current liabilities of million 
to help address our cash needs to meet our obligations during fiscal  we modified payment terms in purchase orders with our vendors to structure payment plans for amounts past due and to be invoiced in the future 
payment plan terms vary by vendor  although generally include a payment schedule when we pay for prior amounts past due and amounts for specified future work which generally would be paid no later than july  under existing plans 
we continue to work with our vendors to comply with the negotiated schedule and to have payment terms extended as needed based on our construction schedule and financing 
with additional financing  as discussed below  and support from our vendors  we reduced our accounts payable and accrued capital expenditures  primarily related to the polysilicon plant  from million as of december  to million as of march  which includes new equipment additions and services performed as of that date 
subsequent to march   we received million under our polysilicon supply contract with solargiga  million in debt financing from china merchants bank  and entered into a credit agreement with china construction bank for million for an aggregate amount of million in additional capital 
this additional capital will enable us to settle our remaining accounts payable and accrued capital expenditures  and it provides us with the necessary capital to sustain operations 
however  this amount is not sufficient to complete construction of the polysilicon plan  and should there be delays in securing additional financing  we may need to implement cost and expense reduction programs and other programs to generate cash that are not currently planned  but are responsive to our liq uidity requirements 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or structure credit terms with our vendors  we would also need to curtail construction of the polysilicon production facility at the end of july if we elect to curtail construction  our excess capital would primarily be used to reduce our current liabilities and for working capital needs 
in addition  we would reserve adequate funding for the purchase of third party polysilicon to meet our contractual obligations with our polysilicon customers  beginning in september  and for interest and other financing costs related to our loans 
as of june   we have funded approximately million of our polysilicon plant 
after considering our recently secured credit line for million credit agreement with china construction bank and million in expected prepayments  we still need to raise an additional million to complete the construction of our polysilicon plant based upon our current estimate of million to complete construction 
we plan on raising this money through debt and or equity offerings and possibly prepayments from new customer contracts 
tianwei has also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to assist us in obtaining additional financing that may be required by us to construct and operate the polysilicon plant 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects the net loss of million which was million higher than fiscal and due primarily to increased operating expenses involved in preparing the polysilicon plant for operations 
after adjusting for noncash operating activities  the higher net loss resulted in an operating cash deficit of million 
in addition  cash expenditures for working capital requirements were million which decreased by million from fiscal due primarily to the timing of solar installation jobs 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal resulted from a net operating cash deficit of million and increased working capital cash requirements of million to fund operations 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was due to an operating cash deficit of million which was offset by cash inflows from working capital funds of million 
we had a working capital deficit of million and million as of march  and  respectively  and a million surplus as of march  the working capital deficits in fiscal and reflect the increased deployment of funds to construct the polysilicon plant in idaho and the company s net losses 
in addition  million of deposits from long term polysilicon contracts were classified as short term liabilities as of march  to reflect the prepayments that apply to the product deliveries that are scheduled to ship within one year 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to the addition of property and equipment related to the construction of our planned polysilicon facility in pocatello  idaho 
in addition  in fiscal  the capital expenditure was off set by the sale of our corporate headquarters  the reduction of restricted cash due to the settl ement of our remaining purchase agreements for euros with bank of hawaii prior to their original maturity dates and net proceeds of short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily related to net proceeds of short term investments  offset by the addition of property and equipment related to the construction of our planned polysilicon facility in pocatello  idaho 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the loan proceeds of million from tianwei and deposits of million received from long term polysilicon contracts 
in addition  million of contributions were received from the noncontrolling interest in hoku solar power i  llc  offset by million in costs related to the tianwei investment and  in net issuance costs related to employee restricted stock awards 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to deposits received rel ated to long term polysilicon contracts of million 
in fiscal  net proceeds were from our sale of common stock of million and deposits received related to long term polysilicon contracts of million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations that existed at march  the amounts in the table below do not include time and materials contracts and  incentive payments 
in addition  the gec graeber engineering consultants gmbh  and msa apparatus construction for chemical equipment  ltd 
contract for the purchase and sale of hydrogen reduction reactors and hydrogenation reactors is to be paid in euros and the contractual obligation is determined based on the euro us dollar exchange rate  which was euro as of march  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands construction in progress equipment purchases supply purchases leases deposits hoku materials total city of pocatello 
in march  we entered into a year ground lease with the city of pocatello  idaho  for approximately acres of land and  in may  the city of pocatello approved an ordinance that authorizes the pocatello development authority to provide us certain tax incentives related to certain necessary infrastructure costs we incur in the construction and operation of our polysilicon plant 
in may  we entered into an economic development agreement  or the eda agreement  with the pocatello development authority  or pda  pursuant to which pda agreed to reimburse to us amounts we actually incur in making certain infrastructure improvements consistent with the north portneuf urban renewal area and revenue allocation district improvement plan and the idaho urban renewal law  or the infrastructure reimbursement  and an additional amount as reimbursement for and based on the number of full time employee equivalents we create and maintain  or the employment reimbursement  at the polysilicon plant 
the parties agreed that a the infrastructure reimbursement will be an amount that is equal to of the tax increment payments pda actually collects on the north portneuf tax increment financing district with respect to our real and personal property located in such district  or the tif revenue  up to approximately million  less the actual road costs defined below  and b the employment reimbursement will be an amount that is equal to of the tif revenue  up to approximately million 
each of the infrastructure reimbursement and the employment reimbursement will be made to us over time as tif revenue is received  and only after the costs of completing a public access road to the polysilicon plant  in an amount not to exceed million  or the road costs  has been paid to pda out of tif revenue  and up to million in capital costs has been paid to the city of pocatello out of tif revenue

if we are unable to sign new polysilicon customers or raise additional financing through debt or equity  tianwei has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to assist us in our operations  and as a result  we believe our cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet the anticipated capital expenditures and cash requirements for our businesses through at least the next twelve months 
the sale of additional equity and convertible debt instruments may result in additional dilution to our current stockholders and or a change of control 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capit al beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization and manufacturing activities  which could harm our business 
our forecasts of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding our operations 
to achieve this objective  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  auction instruments  corporate and government bonds and certificates of deposit 
these investments are generally short term in nature and highly liquid 
as of march   we did not maintain any short term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents as of march  were million 
all of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  except for our contracts with gec and msa which are denominated in euros 
as a result of the early settlement of our euros purchase agreements  we no longer maintain any investment in euros  nor are we a party to any agreements to purchase euros at certain dates in the future 
accordingly  we are subject to the then current spot rate between the us dollar and the euro at such time that a payment is required under the gec and msa contracts 
changes in exchange rates during the periods in which euros based invoices are recorded may result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses
