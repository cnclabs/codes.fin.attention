the warehouse line of credit is used by the mortgage banker to originate one to four family residential mortgage loans that are pre sold to the secondary mortgage market  which includes state and national banks  national mortgage banking firms  insurance companies and government sponsored enterprises  including the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation and others

this overall expansion in electronic banking offers the bank s customers another means to access the bank s services easily and at their own convenience 

table of contents competition the bank experiences substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in making loans 
in attracting deposits and borrowers  the bank competes with commercial banks  savings banks  and savings and loan associations  as well as regional and national insurance companies and non bank financial institutions  regulated small loan companies and local credit unions  regional and national issuers of money market funds and corporate and government borrowers 
within the direct market area of the bank  there are a significant number of offices of competing financial institutions 
in new jersey generally  and in the bank s local market specifically  large commercial banks  as well as savings banks and savings and loan associations  including provident savings bank and hudson city savings bank  hold a dominant market share and there has been significant merger activity in the last few years  creating even larger competitors 
locally  the bank s most direct competitors include bank of america  pnc bank  wachovia bank a subsidiary of wells fargo and sovereign bank 
the bank is at a competitive disadvantage compared with these larger national and regional commercial and savings banks 
by virtue of their larger capital  asset size or reserves  many of such institutions have substantially greater lending limits ceilings on the amount of credit a bank may provide to a single customer that are linked to the institution s capital and other resources than the bank 
many such institutions are empowered to offer a wider range of services  including trust services  than the bank and  in some cases  have lower funding costs the price a bank must pay for deposits and other borrowed monies used to make loans to customers than the bank 
in addition to having established deposit bases and loan portfolios  these institutions  particularly large national and regional commercial and savings banks  have the financial ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable 
in addition  non bank financial institutions offer services that compete for deposits with the bank 
for example  brokerage firms and insurance companies offer such instruments as short term money market funds  corporate and government securities funds  mutual funds and annuities 
it is expected that competition in these areas will continue to increase 
some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and supervision as the company and the bank and therefore may be able to offer customers more attractive products than the bank 
however  management of the bank believes that loans to small and mid sized businesses and professionals  which represent the main commercial loan business of the bank  are not always of primary importance to the larger banking institutions 
the bank competes for this segment of the market by providing responsive personalized services  local decision making  and knowledge of its customers and their businesses 
lending activities the bank s lending activities include both commercial and consumer loans 
loan originations are derived from a number of sources including real estate broker referrals  mortgage loan companies  direct solicitation by the bank s loan officers  existing depositors and borrowers  builders  attorneys  walk in customers and  in some instances  other lenders 
the bank has established disciplined and systematic procedures for approving and monitoring loans that vary depending on the size and nature of the loan 
commercial lending the bank offers a variety of commercial loan services  including term loans  lines of credit  and loans secured by equipment and receivables 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both secured and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisition and development of real estate and improvements  and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
the bank also makes construction loans to real estate developers for the acquisition  development and construction of residential subdivisions 
commercial loans are granted based on the borrower s ability to generate cash flow to support its debt obligations and other cash related expenses 
a borrower s ability to repay commercial loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and on the quality of its management 
as a general practice  the bank takes as collateral a security interest in any available real estate  equipment  inventory  receivables or other personal property of its borrowers  although occasionally the bank makes commercial loans on an unsecured basis 
generally  the bank requires personal guaranties of its commercial loans to offset the risks associated with such loans 

table of contents residential consumer lending a portion of the bank s lending activities consists of the origination of fixed and adjustable rate residential first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied property located in the bank s primary market areas 
home mortgage lending is unique in that a broad geographic territory may be serviced by originators working from strategically placed offices either within the bank s traditional banking facilities or from affordable storefront locations in commercial buildings 
the bank also offers construction loans  second mortgage home improvement loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank finances the construction of individual  owner occupied houses on the basis of written underwriting and construction loan management guidelines 
first mortgage construction loans are made to contractors secured by real estate that is both a pre sold and a speculation basis 
such loans are also made to qualified individual borrowers and are generally supported by a take out commitment from a permanent lender 
the bank makes residential construction loans to individuals who intend to erect owner occupied housing on a purchased parcel of real estate 
the construction phase of these loans has certain risks  including the viability of the contractor  the contractor s ability to complete the project and changes in interest rates 
in most cases  the bank will sell its mortgage loans with terms of years or more in the secondary market 
the sale to the secondary market allows the bank to hedge against the interest rate risks related to such lending operations 
this brokerage arrangement allows the bank to accommodate its clients demands while eliminating the interest rate risk for the to year period generally associated with such loans 
the bank in most cases requires borrowers to obtain and maintain title  fire  and extended casualty insurance  and  where required by applicable regulations  flood insurance 
the bank maintains its own errors and omissions insurance policy to protect against loss in the event of failure of a mortgagor to pay premiums on fire and other hazard insurance policies 
mortgage loans originated by the bank customarily include a due on sale clause  which gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in certain circumstances  including  without limitation  upon the sale or other disposition by the borrower of the real property subject to a mortgage 
in general  the bank enforces due on sale clauses 
borrowers are typically permitted to refinance or repay loans at their option without penalty 
non residential consumer lending non residential consumer loans made by the bank include loans for automobiles  recreation vehicles  and boats  as well as personal loans secured and unsecured and deposit account secured loans 
the bank also conducts various indirect lending activities through established retail companies in its market areas 
non residential consumer loans are attractive to the bank because they typically have a shorter term and carry higher interest rates than are charged on other types of loans 
non residential consumer loans  however  do pose additional risk of collectibility when compared to traditional types of loans  such as residential mortgage loans granted by commercial banks 
consumer loans are granted based on employment and financial information solicited from prospective borrowers as well as credit records collected from various reporting agencies 
stability of the borrower  willingness to pay and credit history are the primary factors to be considered 
the availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such a loan 
the bank seeks collateral that can be assigned and has good marketability with a clearly adequate margin of value 
the geographic area of the borrower is another consideration  with preference given to borrowers in the bank s primary market areas 
supervision and regulation banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy 
in furtherance of those goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted a myriad of legislation that governs banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection of the company s shareholders 
descriptions of  and references to  the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries thereof  and do not purport to be complete 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed

the federal reserve board has issued a supervisory letter to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate or defer or severely limit dividends including  for example  when net income available for shareholders for the past four quarters net of previously paid dividends paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital at the beginning of the quarter below the capital outstanding at the end of the quarter 

table of contents capital adequacy the company is required to comply with minimum capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board 
there are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies and the depository institutions that they own a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for a bank holding company to be considered in compliance 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia required each federal banking agency to revise its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
in addition  pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations  specifying the levels at which a bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution 
the regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia provide that a bank will be classified as well capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  and iv meets certain other requirements 
a bank will be classified as adequately capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of a at least percent  or b at least percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  and iv does not meet the definition of well capitalized 
a bank will be classified as undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of a less than percent  or b less than percent if the institution was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
a bank will be classified as significantly undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of less than percent 
an institution will be classified as critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than percent 
an insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination 
as of december   the bank s capital ratios exceed the requirements to be considered a well capitalized institution under these regulations 
the risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies such as the company currently require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total capital is required to be tier capital  consisting principally of common shareholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
the remainder of the total capital tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance 
at december   the company maintained a tier capital ratio of and total qualifying capital ratio of 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio tier capital to total assets guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
the company s leverage ratio at december  was 
on may   the company established st constitution capital trust ii  a delaware business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the company trust ii  for the sole purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities the capital securities 
trust ii utilized the million proceeds along with  invested in trust ii by the company to purchase  of floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by the company and due to mature on june  the capital securities were issued in connection with a pooled offering involving approximately other financial institution holding companies 
all of the capital securities were sold to a single pooling vehicle 
the floating rate junior subordinated debentures are the only asset of trust ii and have terms that mirror the capital securities 
these debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity after june  trust ii is obligated to distribute all proceeds of a redemption of these debentures  whether voluntary or upon maturity  to holders of the capital securities 
the company s obligation with respect to the capital securities and the debentures  when taken together  provided a full and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by the company of the obligations of trust ii to pay amounts when due on the capital securities 
interest payments on the floating rate junior subordinated debentures flow through trust ii to the pooling vehicle 

table of contents on december   pursuant to the tarp cpp under eesa  the company entered into a letter agreement  including the securities purchase agreement standard terms  with the treasury  pursuant to which the company issued and sold  and the treasury purchased i  shares of the company s preferred stock series b and ii a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  no par value  at an initial exercise price of per share  for aggregate cash consideration of million 
as a result of the declarations of stock dividends to holders of common stock since the issuance of the warrant  the shares of common stock underlying the warrant have been adjusted to  shares and the initial exercise price was adjusted to per share 
the preferred stock series b pays quarterly cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year and has a liquidation preference of  per share 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the company s common stock  and upon certain issuances of the company s common stock at or below a specified price relative to the initial exercise price 
the warrant is immediately exercisable and expires ten years from the issuance date 
in addition  the treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
restrictions on dividends the primary source of cash to pay dividends  if any  to the company s shareholders and to meet the company s obligations is dividends paid to the company by the bank 
dividend payments by the bank to the company are subject to the new jersey banking act of the banking act and the federal deposit insurance act the fdia 
under the banking act and the fdia  the bank may not pay any dividends if after paying the dividend  it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements 
in addition to these explicit limitations  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
depending upon the circumstances  the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary 
a bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent 
the company has never paid a cash dividend and the company s board of directors has no plans to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future 
in addition  please refer to the discussion above of the preferred stock series b under the heading supervision and regulation for additional restrictions on cash dividends 
the bank paid a stock dividend every year from to when it was acquired by the company

the company also declared a two for one stock split on january   which was paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  all share and per share data has been retroactively adjusted for the stock split and stock dividends 
priority on liquidation the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the rights of the company as the sole shareholder of the bank  and therefore the rights of the company s creditors and shareholders  to participate in the distributions and earnings of the bank when the bank is not in bankruptcy  are subject to various state and federal law restrictions as discussed above under the heading restrictions of dividends 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as the bank  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of an obligation of the institution to its shareholders the company or any shareholder or creditor of the company 
the claims on the bank by creditors include obligations in respect of federal funds purchased and certain other borrowings  as well as deposit liabilities 

table of contents financial institution legislation the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the modernization act became effective in early the modernization act allows bank holding companies meeting management  capital and community reinvestment act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities than is permissible for a bank holding company  including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies  if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  it files a certification  effective in days  and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals  allows banks to establish subsidiaries to engage in certain activities which a financial holding company could engage in  if the bank meets certain management  capital and community reinvestment act standards  allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks and removes various restrictions that currently apply to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies  and establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to financial holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations 
the modernization act modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the modernization act also amended the bhca and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking and financial services industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the company cannot be determined at this time

the rule changes are intended to  among other things  make the board of directors independent of management and allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors 
these increased burdens have increased the company s legal and accounting fees and the amount of time that the board of directors and management must devote to corporate governance issues 
effective august   as directed by section a of sarbanes oxley  the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer are each required to certify that the company s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made  in light of circumstances under which they were made  not misleading

under the program  effective december   insured depository institutions that have not opted out of the temporary liquidity guaranty program will be subject to a surcharge applied to non interest bearing transaction deposit account balances in excess of  which surcharge will be added to the institution s existing risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the bank opted in the fdic temporary liquidity guaranty program 
in february  the fdic announced that it would impose an emergency special assessment of surcharge on all insured institutions to be collected on september  and that it may also impose possible additional special assessments of up to to maintain public confidence in the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic subsequently reduced the amount of the emergency special assessment to in march in november  the fdic announced that it would require insured institutions to prepay slightly over three years of estimated insurance assessments 
the prepayment allowed the fdic to strengthen the cash position of the deposit insurance fund 
payment of the prepaid assessment of  along with the  payment of the regular third quarter assessment  was made by the bank on december  item a 
risk factors 
the following are some important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forward looking statement 
these are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and the company s other filings with the sec 
a prolonged economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations 
the global and us economic downturn has resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general with the possibility of a slow recovery or a fall back into recession 
the federal reserve  in an attempt to help the overall economy  has kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
a prolonged economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations by causing an increase in our provision for loan losses and a deterioration of our loan portfolio 
such a downturn may also adversely affect our ability to originate or sell loans 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact our financial performance 

table of contents a prolonged or worsened downturn affecting the economy and or the real estate market in our primary market area would adversely affect our loan portfolio and our growth potential 
much of the company s lending is in northern and central new jersey 
as a result of this geographic concentration  a further significant broad based deterioration in economic conditions in the new jersey metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the company s loan portfolio  results of operations and future growth potential 
a prolonged decline in economic conditions in our market area could restrict borrowers ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due  and consequently  adversely affect the cash flows and results of operation of the company s business 
the company s loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate collateral located in the state of new jersey 
conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the company s loans are located strongly influence the level of the company s non performing loans and results of operations 
a continued decline in the new jersey real estate markets could adversely affect the company s loan portfolio 
decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans 
adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
the company faces significant competition 
the company faces significant competition from many other banks  savings institutions and other financial institutions which have branch offices or otherwise operate in the company s market area 
non bank financial institutions  such as securities brokerage firms  insurance companies and money market funds  engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business  which has also led to greater competition 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the company  including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the company is able to accommodate and the ability to aggressively advertise their products and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company and the bank will be able to successfully compete with these entities in the future 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the spread between the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans and other investments narrows  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
this also includes the risk that interest earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa repricing risk  the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk  and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability maturities yield curve risk 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with speculative construction lending 
the risks associated with speculative construction lending include the borrower s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget  the sale of the project within projected absorption periods  the economic risks associated with real estate collateral  and the potential of a rising interest rate environment 
such loans may include financing the development and or construction of residential subdivisions 
this activity may involve financing land purchase  infrastructure development ie roads  utilities  etc  as well as construction of residences or multi family dwellings for subsequent sale by developer builder 
because the sale of developed properties is integral to the success of developer business  loan repayment may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market values 
management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending 
further  management concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the bank s lending areas 

table of contents federal and state government regulation impacts the company s operations 
the operations of the company and the bank are heavily regulated and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities 
in particular  the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board to implement its objectives are changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings 
it is not possible to predict what changes  if any  will be made to the monetary policies of the federal reserve board or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on the future business and earnings prospects of the company 
the company and the bank are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
compliance with the rules and regulations of these agencies may be costly and may limit growth and restrict certain activities  including payment of dividends  investments  loans and interest rate charges  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
the bank is also subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation and regulations 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time  and we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business and profitability 
because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies  the cost of compliance could adversely affect the company s result of operations 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loan and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
market reform efforts may result in our businesses becoming subject to extensive and pervasive additional regulations 
recent economic and market conditions have led to numerous proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial industry in an effort to prevent future crises and reform the financial regulatory system 
president obama s administration has released a comprehensive plan for regulatory reform in the financial industry 
the administration s plan contains significant proposed structural reforms  including heightened powers for the federal reserve to regulate risk across the financial system  a new financial services oversight council chaired by the us treasury  and two new federal agencies  a consumer financial protection agency and a new national bank supervisor 
the plan also calls for new substantive regulation across the financial industry  including more heightened scrutiny and regulation for any financial firm whose combination of size  leverage  and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability if it failed 

table of contents there can be no assurance as to whether or when any of the parts of the administration s plan or other proposals will be enacted into legislation  and if adopted  what the final provisions of such legislation will be 
the financial services industry is highly regulated  and the company and the bank are subject to regulation by several government agencies  including the federal reserve board and the fdic 
legislative and regulatory changes  as well as changes in governmental economic and monetary policy  not only can affect our ability to attract deposits and make loans  but can also affect the demand for business and personal lending and for real estate mortgages 
government regulations affect virtually all areas of our operations  including our range of permissible activities  products and services  the amount of service fees or the ability to assess such fees  the geographic locations in which our services can be offered  the amount of capital required to be maintained to support operations  the right to pay dividends and the amount which we can pay to obtain deposits 
new legislation and regulatory changes could require the company to change certain of its business practices  impose additional costs on us  or otherwise adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market constantly changes and recently  given the uncertainty in the financial markets  has fluctuated widely 
from the beginning of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  events negatively impacting the financial services industry which result in a general decline in the market valuation of our common stock  announcements of material developments affecting our operations or our dividend policy  future sales of our equity securities  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  and general domestic economic and market conditions 
in addition  recently the stock market generally has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results 
the company is subject to liquidity risk 
liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due  capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise  or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is required to fund various obligations  including credit commitments to borrowers  mortgage and other loan originations  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of borrowings  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures 

table of contents liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole 
our agreements with the treasury impose restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common stock or trust preferred securities 
on december   we issued preferred stock series b and a warrant to purchase our common stock to the treasury as part of its tarp cpp 
prior to december   unless we have redeemed all of the preferred stock series b or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock series b to a third party  the consent of the treasury will be required for us to  among other things  pay cash dividends on our common stock or repurchase our common stock or other trust preferred securities with certain exceptions  including the repurchase of our common stock in connection with an employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice 
higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition 
fdic insurance premiums have increased substantially in and we may have to pay significantly higher fdic premiums in the future and prepay insurance premiums 
market developments during significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
the fdic adopted a revised risk based deposit insurance assessment schedule during the first quarter of  which raised regular deposit insurance premiums 
in may  the fdic also implemented a five basis point special assessment of each insured depository institution s total assets minus tier capital as of june   but no more than basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of  collected by the fdic on september  the amount of this special assessment for the bank was  in november  the fdic announced that it would require insured institutions to prepay slightly over three years of estimated insurance assessments 
the prepayment allowed the fdic to strengthen the cash position of the deposit insurance fund 
payment of the prepaid assessment of  along with the  payment of the regular third quarter assessment  was made by the bank on december  the fdic may impose additional special assessments for future quarters or may increase the fdic standard assessments 
we cannot provide you with any assurances that we will not be required to pay additional fdic insurance assessments  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our shares of preferred stock series b impact net income available to our common stockholders and our earnings per share 
as long as there are shares of preferred stock series b outstanding  no cash dividends may be paid on our common stock unless all dividends on the preferred stock series b have been paid in full 
the dividends declared on our preferred stock series b reduce the net income available to common shareholders and our earnings per common share 
additionally  warrants to purchase the company s common stock issued to the treasury  in conjunction with the issuance of shares of preferred stock series b  may be dilutive to our earnings per share 
the shares of preferred stock series b will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock and have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
until the earlier of i december  or ii the date the treasury no longer owns any shares of preferred stock series b  we may not pay any dividends on our common stock without obtaining the prior consent of the treasury 

table of contents future offerings of debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources or  if our or the bank s capital ratios fall below the required minimums  we or the bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities  including medium term notes  trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
the company may lose lower cost funding sources 
checking  savings  and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments  the company could lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing its funding costs and reducing the company s net interest income and net income 
there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the company s assets or liabilities and financial results 
the company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses  security impairment  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
under each of these policies  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  using different assumptions  or as new information becomes available 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of the company s external financial statements 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb  sec  banking regulators and the company s outside auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the company s control  can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the company reports its financial results and condition 
in certain cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently also retroactively which may result in the company restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 
the company encounters continuous technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to operational risk 
the company faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures  including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders  may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented  thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the company may also be subject to disruptions of its systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
the company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the company and to the risk that the company s or its vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the company s performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
there is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees 
in addition  the company faces increasing competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals 
the emergency economic stabilization act and the agreements between the company and the treasury related to the purchase of the company s preferred stock series b and common stock warrants place restrictions on the company s ability to pay compensation to its senior officers 
the company s business operations could be adversely affected if it were unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees 
there may be claims and litigation 
from time to time as part of the company s normal course of business  customers make claims and take legal action against the company based on actions or inactions of the company 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the company  they may result in financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the company and its products and services 
this may also impact customer demand for the company s products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  acts of terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 
a significant portion of our primary markets are located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather  or in response to climate change  that could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
additionally  surrounding areas  including new jersey  may be central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the united states 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although we have established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
throughout the following sections  the company refers to st constitution bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries  st constitution bank and st constitution capital trust ii  the bank refers to st constitution bank  and the trust ii refers to st constitution capital trust ii 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policies with respect to the methodologies for the determination of the allowance for loan losses and for determining other than temporary security impairment involve a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
these critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available to it  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 

table of contents management utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio 
to the extent they exist  unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets level or quoted prices on similar assets level are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
in the absence of quoted prices  valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 
valuation techniques are based on various assumptions  including  but not limited to cash flows  discount rates  rate of return  adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity  and liquidation values 
a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level inputs 
the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
management must periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the securities valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary 
the analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions  including  but not limited to  the length of time an investment s book value is greater than fair value  the severity of the investment s decline  as well as any credit deterioration of the investment 
if the decline in value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value and a non cash impairment charge is recognized in the period of such evaluation 
results of operations the company reported net income for the year ended december  of  a decrease of from the  reported for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to i a larger provision for loan losses  ii a substantial increase in the fdic deposit insurance premiums  iii an other than temporary security impairment and iv increases in salaries and employee benefits which was offset by a an increase in net interest income  b the increase in non interest income  which was principally increased by gains on sale of securities available for sale and gains on sales of loans  and c a reduction of income taxes 
net income available to common shareholders fell from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  for the reasons indicated above and the payment of dividends on the company s preferred stock series b in diluted net income per common share was for the year ended december  compared to reported for the year ended december  basic net income per common share for the year ended december  was as compared to the reported for the year ended december  net income available to common shareholders was reduced in by an aggregate of  attributable to dividends and discount accretion related to the preferred stock issued to the united states department of the treasury 
no similar amount was recorded in all share information has been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on february  to shareholders of record on january  return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  and and  respectively  for the year ended december  key performance ratios declined for the fiscal year as compared to the prior year due to the lower net income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the bank s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is primarily affected by the market interest rate environment  the shape of the us treasury yield curve  and the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
other factors that may affect the bank s operating results are general and local economic and competitive conditions  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was as compared to the net interest margin recorded for the year ended december   a reduction of basis points 
the company will continue to closely monitor the mix of earning assets and funding sources to maximize net interest income during this challenging interest rate environment 
net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them  respectively 

table of contents the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december   and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively 
average balance sheets with resultant interest and rates yields on a tax equivalent basis average average average average average average balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate assets federal funds sold short term investments investment securities taxable tax exempt total loan portfolio construction residential real estate home equity commercial and commercial real estate mortgage warehouse lines installment all other loans total total interest earning assets allowance for loan losses cash and due from banks other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities money market and now accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit under  certificates of deposit of  and over other borrowed funds trust preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread non interest bearing demand deposits other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest margin 
table of contents loan origination fees are considered an adjustment to interest income 
for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under the heading non performing assets for a discussion of the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
tax equivalent basis

table of contents the company regularly reviews the composition of the investment securities portfolio  taking into account market risks  the current and expected interest rate environment  liquidity needs  and its overall interest rate risk profile and strategic goals 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates each security in the portfolio with an individual unrealized loss to determine if that loss represents other than temporary impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was necessary  following other than temporary impairment requirements  to write down the cost basis of the company s only pooled trust preferred security 
the trust preferred security  which is held in our held to maturity portfolio  was issued by a two issuer pool preferred term securities xxv  ltd 
co issued by keefe  bruyette and woods  inc and first tennessee pretsl xxv  consisting primarily of financial institution holding companies 
the primary factor used to determine the credit portion of the impairment loss to be recognized in the income statement for this security was the discounted present value of projected cash flow where that present value of cash flow was less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
the present value of cash flow was developed using an eitf model that considered performing collateral ratios  the level of subordination to senior tranches of the security  credit ratings of and projected credit defaults in the underlying collateral 
the following table sets forth information with respect to this security at december  pooled trust preferred security detail security class book value fair value unrealized gain loss percent of underlying collateral performing percent of underlying collateral in deferral percent of underlying collateral in default moody s s p fitch ratings pretsl xxv b ca nr cc the original cost of pretsl xxv at december  was  in reviewing our investment in pretsl xxv at december   we have assumed average deferrals and defaults of per year through the remaining term of the security through june 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of  on this held to maturity security  of which  was determined to be a credit loss and charged to operations and  was determined to be non credit related and recognized in the other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could cause management to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to pretsl xxv constitutes an additional credit impairment 
these factors include  but are not limited to  failure to make interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an impairment in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render management unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair value of trust preferred securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of the issuers continue to deteriorate and there remains limited liquidity for these securities 
all other unrealized securities losses are deemed temporary at december  additional discussions of these unrealized losses can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
loans held for sale loans held for sale at december  amounted to  compared to  at december  the primary cause for this increase was a significantly higher volume of mortgage loan refinance activity during compared with the level of activity during as indicated in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the amount of loans originated for sale was  for compared with  for this increased volume has lengthened the operational processing time for the loans as they migrate from origination to ultimate funding by investors 

table of contents loans the loan portfolio  which represents our largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income

these loans are generally secured by business assets of the commercial borrower 
the average yield on the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased basis points to for from for construction loans averaged  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  generally  these loans represent owner occupied or investment properties and usually complement a broader commercial relationship between the bank and the borrower

the average yield on the construction loan portfolio decreased basis points to for from for during  the bank s mortgage warehouse unit introduced a revolving line of credit that is available to licensed mortgage banking companies the warehouse line of credit and that has been successful since inception 
the warehouse line of credit is used by the mortgage banker to originate one to four family residential mortgage loans that are pre sold to the secondary mortgage market  which includes state and national banks  national mortgage banking firms  insurance companies and government sponsored enterprises  including the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation and others 
on average  an advance under the warehouse line of credit remains outstanding for a period of less than days  with repayment coming directly from the sale of the loan into the secondary mortgage market

table of contents the following table provides information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of the commercial and commercial real estate loans and construction loans at december  maturity range type within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial commercial real estate construction total fixed rate loans floating rate loans total non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due  unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans increased by  to  at december   from  at december  as the disruptions in the financial system and the real estate market during those two years have negatively affected certain of the bank s construction borrowers 
the major segments of non accrual loans consist of land designated for residential development where the required approvals to begin construction have been received  commercial loans which are in the process of collection and residential real estate which is either in foreclosure or under contract to close after december  the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans increased to at december  from at december  loan quality is still considered to be sound 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
in addition to the foregoing  in the fourth quarter of  the bank acquired a property  via deed in lieu of foreclosure  securing a  loan  which will be used in the bank s operations 
this property is included in premises and equipment at december  at december   the bank had two loans that totaled  in loans that were days or more past due and still accruing interest income

table of contents the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at december  or non performing assets and loans non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for any delinquent loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less the estimated selling costs  or the initially recorded amount 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the collateral is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because a collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the inherent primary risks are deteriorating credit quality  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements 
these elements may include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 

table of contents trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
a specific reserve for high risk loans is established for commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk or impaired loans 
a high risk or impaired loan is assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or in part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for such individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which  in turn  employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
during the quarterly reviews  the company may determine that an unallocated allowance is appropriate 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates inherently lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believed that the allowance for loan losses was adequate 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents the following table presents  for the years indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data

in addition to these factors  management takes into consideration current economic conditions and local real estate market conditions 
using this evaluation process  the company s provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  while the risk profile of the loan portfolio was reduced by a change in its composition via a  reduction in higher risk construction loans  non performing loans increased by  and the total loan portfolio grew by  from december  to december  this increase in both the loan portfolio and non performing loans as well as the adverse economic conditions that resulted in depreciation of collateral values securing construction and commercial loans necessitated the increased provision

table of contents liquidity at december   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational and customer credit needs could be satisfied 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and a correspondent bank which further supports and enhances liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained an overnight line of credit at the fhlb in the amount of  plus a one month overnight repricing line of credit of  advances issued under these programs are subject to fhlb stock level and collateral requirements

interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities

management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective  and therefore has focused its efforts on increasing the bank s spread by attracting lower cost retail deposits 
in addition to utilizing the gap ratio for interest rate risk assessment  management utilizes simulation analysis whereby the model estimates the variance in net income with a change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over and month periods 
given recent simulations  net interest income would be within policy guidelines regardless of the direction of market rates
