item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated audited financial statements and related notes  as well as the risk factors and other information contained in this annual report 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon  among other things  our consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to  among other things  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations  although they could 
our critical accounting policies  the policies we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  are outlined below in critical accounting policies

we make extensive use of our customized information system to closely monitor all aspects of our business  including customer relationship management  intelligent purchasing  inventory control  inventory flow  line item margin control for every order  and weighted average cost and statistical data for products  customers and suppliers  as deemed appropriate 
we believe a strong focus on providing better service to customers leads to increased customer satisfaction and retention and potential increases in sales 
management and employees spend a significant amount of time traveling to latin america and asia with the purpose of spending time with key customers  suppliers and employees 
we believe that these relationships are vital to our success and we will continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to this area 
industry trends and  risks since  a rapid decline in wireless handset sales in the central and south american markets we serve has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our net sales 
excess supply conditions and the extended global economic downturn have reduced and may continue to reduce demand for our products and the market prices of the products we sell 
these reductions affect our ability to generate net sales  margins and gross profit at expected levels and could continue to affect the value of our inventory  as well as customer payment trends 
for example  the second half of and the first quarter of generally saw a decrease in handset demand globally  including our sales regions  and an increase in carrier inventory  which both had a negative impact on our financial results during and and created a more difficult sales environment  requiring additional operating expenses to help maintain and increase our sales 
we saw these trends begin to ease in the second quarter of in the regions we serve 
conversely  should manufacturers be unable to respond to an unanticipated increase in demand as the global economy recovers on a timely basis  we  along with others in our industry  could experience supply constraints that would affect our ability to deliver products 
we are unable to quantify these effects  as it is difficult to predict future supply conditions and demand patterns that affect our ability to meet customer demand or sell handsets at an acceptable gross profit 
during the second half of  and continuing through the period of this report  our industry has been impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown 
we believe that some of the countries in the regions where we operate  particularly in central america  have close economic relations with  and therefore have been impacted by weak economic conditions in the united states 
we believe this adversely impacted consumer demand for the wireless handsets we sell  and as a result our overall operations  including net sales  during the first half of we began to experience a small increase in the demand for handsets in the third quarter of  which positively affected our net sales for the 
table of contents third and fourth quarters 
we have also begun to observe a decrease in some subsidies offered by operators in the region  which increases the handset price to the consumer  and this has reduced overall handset volumes 
we are also beginning to see more low cost manufacturers gaining traction with entry level products  which is negatively affecting both our oem and verykool sales in the entry level segment 
company specific trends and risks our long term strategy incorporates overall market growth elements for our business  which we hope will result in future growth as global economic conditions recover 
our verykool proprietary line of products  for which we had several models selling as of december  continued to show increased orders and sales during and is expected to become an increasing part of our overall business in the future 
our verykool products continue to increase product diversification in central and south america  which we believe should contribute to profitability 
we have more control over the production and supply of our verykool line of products than the oem products we distribute 
we were able to increase our gross margins to for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  these results were primarily due to a product mix shift  including increased sales of higher margin products including our verykool products  better product sourcing for our verykool line of products and beneficial purchasing opportunities 
argentina  one of the countries where we currently sell a significant amount of oem products and where we generated of our net sales in  passed a new tariff in november impacting certain imported electronics  including wireless handsets 
from the information we have obtained  this new tariff could impact the pricing at the point of sale in excess of  and we expect that it will reduce significantly our overall oem sales volume in argentina 
we believe that this tariff will have a material adverse impact on our sales  results of operations and prospects for our oem products in argentina 
during  we provided products and services to approximately customers 
our three largest customers in fiscal represented  and of our net sales  respectively 
all three of these customers are carriers in south america 
in  a customer accounting for  has begun significantly reducing its purchases from us as a result of the newly enacted argentina tariff on wireless handsets  among other electronic devices 
additional argentina customers are expected to decrease or eliminate their purchases of imported wireless handsets in the coming fiscal quarters results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales from continuing operations of million was higher than our net sales from continuing operations of million for the average selling price of wireless handsets sold in increased relative to  due primarily to increased volume of higher priced handsets  including some of our verykool and oem products 
the increase in average selling price was partially offset by a decrease in overall wireless handset sales volume 
the geographic mix of net sales shifted slightly in the twelve months ended december  as sales in south america were more than of net sales  compared to of net sales for 
table of contents sales in central america decreased to of total net sales in the twelve months ended december   as compared to for these regional shifts in net sales resulted from the factors discussed below 
for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands net sales units sold  increase decrease over prior year average selling price  increase decrease over prior year in south and central america  we have continued to expand our customer base and geographic presence by seeking new customers and additional business with existing customers for both our oem and verykool line of products 
in south america  net sales were million for the twelve months ended december   a increase from this increase was primarily due to increased sales in existing countries where we sell products  primarily argentina 
in central america  net sales decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   which was primarily due to the continuing low demand during the year  which we believe was related to the worldwide and regional economic downturn 
despite the year over year decline  we have seen sequential quarterly improvement in central america in the second and third quarters of the second quarter of increased over the first quarter of and the third quarter of increased over the first quarter of a seasonal decrease in sales resulted in a smaller increase in the fourth quarter of of over the first quarter of our sales in argentina  where we generated of our net sales in  will be materially adversely affected by the new tariff and loss of a customer described above 
while we have not yet experienced a significant decrease in sales to argentina at the date of this report  we believe that in the coming quarters  the full impact of the tariff will necessitate significant steps by us in response 
such steps may include  without limitation  establishing relationships in argentina that are tariff compliant and consequently eliminate the tariff on our oem and proprietary products  focusing on increasing sales in other countries and aligning our cost structure with the level of sales 
we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods reported in our consolidated audited financial statements 
net sales by geographic region for the year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands central america south america total cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of net sales  and gross margin was  as compared with million  or of net sales  and for gross margin for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due to a product mix

it also included the write off of intangible assets related to our argentina business described in item  note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
operating expense decreased as a percentage of net sales as we took action to reduce fixed operational costs to match current market conditions 
our management continues to review expenses in an effort to better match operational costs with the future business opportunities  by shifting expenses from fixed to variable components when possible  among other approaches 
we believe such measures will assist us as we strive to achieve profitability in the current volatile market

for the year ended december   we incurred a loss of million from discontinued operations  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the loss was a result of very low sales in the us and mexico during and  as we wound down our business in these areas  as well as the other matters discussed in item  note to the consolidated audited financial statements

further  we discontinued our operations in the united states and mexico in for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands net sales units sold  increase decrease over prior year average selling price  decrease over prior year 
table of contents in south america  net sales were million for  a increase from this increase was primarily due to increased sales in existing countries  most notably argentina  and the addition during the first half of of a new carrier relationship in colombia 
in central america  net sales decreased to million for  which was primarily due to the continuing unusually low demand during the third and fourth quarters of we believe the worldwide economic downturn impacted that region also  especially during the second half of net sales by geographic region for the year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands central america south america total cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of net sales  and gross margin was  compared with million  or of net sales  and for gross margin for the year ended december  the increase in both our total cost of sales and as a percentage of net sales and decrease in gross margin were primarily due to inventory write downs  sales of some products at or below cost and a product mix shift  including increased sales of low margin products 
inventory write downs during were approximately million  or of cost of sales  and in addition  we sold product below our cost in order to reduce inventory levels and incurred costs of million on these products 
these actions primarily resulted from of the abrupt shift in market conditions and resulted in decreased demand  particularly in central america  in the second half of we had immaterial inventory write downs in some of our oem partners that had previously entered into the low tier handset range continued to sell a higher amount of low tier handsets  which had less margin opportunity than mid tier and high end handsets sales 
our gross margin was impacted by the change of product and regional mix of our sales 
the economic downturn also reduced consumer demand for higher priced and higher margin products 
for the year ended december   our gross profit decreased to million from million  a decrease of compared with the year ended december  this decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the million inventory write down during  as well as sales of certain products below cost in efforts to reduce inventory levels and carrying costs

as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity cash and available borrowings to continue our operations for the next months 
year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities at december   we had million in cash  a decrease of million from december   and we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  an increase of million from december  during the twelve months ended december   we used cash and continued to leverage our credit facility to fund our operations 
the increase in our use of the credit facility was directly related to the significantly increased levels of accounts receivable and our taking advantage of purchase discounts during the twelve months ended december  the net cash used in operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to net cash provided from operating activities of million for the change resulted primarily from significantly increased accounts receivable and decreased accrued expenses  but was offset by a smaller decrease in accounts payable compared to the change in trade accounts receivable increased by million and accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million from december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the sales activity towards the later part of and the standard payment terms of sales we provide our customers 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  compared to december  was primarily due to our taking advantage of beneficial purchasing terms offered by other vendors and partners in the ordinary course in accounts receivable other decreased by million and inventory decreased by million from december  days of sales outstanding days of sales outstanding the average number of days it takes to collect revenue after a sale is made at december  was days  compared with days at december  this increase was due to several customers making payments shortly after the year end  as more than of our accounts receivable at december  were still within current terms provided to our customers 
normal payment terms require our customers to pay on a net day or net day basis  depending on the customer 
the extension of net day terms was required to remain competitive in the regions in which we currently operate  central and south america 
in an effort to penetrate new markets and reach new customers  we may offer terms beyond our normal terms 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities the net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to cash used of  for the year ended december  the use of cash during and was primarily the result of our investment in tooling and molds for our proprietary verykool products 
net cash provided by used in financing activities the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million as a result of million funding from our credit facility 
this source of funding was offset by the net repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million was primarily the result of payments on our credit facility due to less financing needs for our decreased levels of inventory and accounts receivable 
working capital our net working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  this slight decrease was primarily due to an increase in amounts drawn on our bank credit facility and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses for the year ended december  borrowings on april   we entered into a loan  security and bulk purchase agreement and a letter of credit and security agreement collectively  the agreement with wells fargo century  inc the lender  replacing the then existing asset based secured credit facility with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na pursuant to the agreement  the lender may advance up to  to us based on the expected collections of eligible receivables as well as value of our eligible inventory determined in accordance with the agreement 
the outstanding advances may not exceed the lesser of i  or ii the sum of the value of the eligible receivables and eligible inventory multiplied by their respective advance rates as set forth in the agreement million at december  
at december   the majority of our debt was based on foreign accounts receivable  a majority of which is insured

the interest rate for each borrowing under the credit facility is  at our option  either the wells fargo bank na prime rate minus less at december  or the libor rate plus plus at december  
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
at december  and december   amounts drawn against the credit facility were million and million  respectively 
credit lines have been an important part of operating and growing our business  and market changes affecting accounts receivable have  and will in the future  diminish or increase the borrowing base of available funds under our current credit line 
at december  and december   advances were at and of the available borrowing base 
at february   we had no balance against our line of credit 

table of contents year ended december  cash provided by operating activities at december   we had million in cash  an increase of million from december  during the year ended december   we continued to leverage our bank and vendor credit facilities to fund our operations  in addition to reducing our accounts receivable and inventory levels 
the net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from substantially decreased inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the million decrease in inventory at december  in addition to a million decrease in prepaid inventory were primarily attributable to our efforts to reduce inventory levels as a result of worldwide economic conditions 
accounts receivable decreased million primarily due to decreased sales in the second half of  which we believe was substantially the result of the worldwide economic downturn 
accounts payable at december  decreased million 
the decrease was related to our decreased use of our vendors credit facilities during the year ended december   as we decreased our inventory levels as noted above 
days of sales outstanding days of sales outstanding at december  was days  compared with days at december  this decrease was due to continuous efforts to keep our customers to the payment terms we provide 
cash used in investing activities the net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december  the use of cash during and was primarily the result of our investment in tooling and molds for our proprietary verykool products 
net cash used in provided by financing activities the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million was primarily the result of payments on our bank credit facilities due to less financing needs for our decreased levels of inventory and accounts receivable  compared to  when we had cash provided from financing activities of million as a result of funding from our bank credit facilities 
working capital our net working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by the increase in our cash balance  for the year ended december  in addition  the loss from discontinued operations of million also reduced our overall working capital 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results  and require management s judgments to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products is determined  which occurs at the time 
table of contents of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative arrangements marketing  training and promotional funds  returns  and allowances 
consideration is given on select sales for cooperative arrangements related to market development  training and special promotions  usually agreed upon in advance 
the amount given is generally in the form of a credit memo  which is applied as a reduction of the sale price and recorded as a current liability 
expenditures made pursuant to the agreed upon activity reduce this liability 
to the extent we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize that amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjust the estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in revenue and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment on a net day or net day basis depending on the customer 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change  including increasing the risk of collectability and sales returns  and may require additional provisions  which could negatively impact our operating results 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally three months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant demand forecast for the applicable period 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we limit inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding several months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time  and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  we sometimes build inventories in excess of demand for the applicable future periods 
if this occurs  we provide a reserve  which may have a negative impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we lease corporate and administrative office facilities  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
certain of these leases contain renewal options 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also have a line of credit facility  which is shown on our balance sheet as a current liability and the balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents the following is a schedule of aggregate future minimum rental payments required by the above leases 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years revolving line of credit operating lease obligations total the outstanding balance varies daily includes buildings and equipment we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding revolving line of credit 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the prime rate minus at march  or libor plus at march  
for every increase in our bank s prime rate or libor  our interest expense would increase by  assuming the same million remained outstanding for the entire year 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables  such as changes in sales volumes  which could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that we would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
market risk substantial portions of our revenues and expenses are transacted in markets outside the united states  however all sales transactions and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for both our domestic and foreign sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or 
table of contents regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations had a material impact on our financial results during  or
