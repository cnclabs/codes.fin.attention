item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we have four reportable segments consumer products and services  background screening  online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions 
in the year ended december   we changed our segment reporting by realigning a portion of the business activities previously included in the other segment into the consumer products and services segment 
the change in business segments was determined based on how our senior management operated  analyzed and evaluated our operations beginning in the three months ended december  additionally  net enforcers and captira analytical s business activities previously included in the other segment met the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting as of december  our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
this segment consists of identity theft management tools  services from our relationship with a third party that administers referrals for identity theft to major banking institutions and breach response services  membership product offerings and other subscription based services such as life and accidental death insurance 
our background screening segment includes the personnel and vendor background screening services provided by screening international 
our online brand protection segment includes corporate brand protection provided by net enforcers 
our bail bonds industry solutions segment includes the software management solutions for the bail bond industry provided by captira analytical 
consumer products and services we offer consumers a variety of consumer protection services and other consumer products and services primarily on a subscription basis 
our services help consumers protect themselves against identity theft or fraud and understand and monitor their credit profiles and other personal information 
through our subsidiary  intersections insurance services  we offer a portfolio of services to include consumer discounts on healthcare  home  and auto related expenses  access to professional financial and legal information  and life  accidental death and disability insurance products 
our consumer services are offered through relationships with clients  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada  and clients in other industries 
our products and services are marketed to customers of our clients  and often are branded and tailored to meet our clients specifications 
our clients are principally credit card  direct deposit or mortgage issuing financial institutions  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada 
with certain of our financial institution clients  we have broadened our marketing efforts to access demand deposit accounts 
our financial institution clients currently account for the majority of our existing subscriber base 
we also are continuing to augment our client base through relationships with insurance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage companies  associations  travel companies  retail companies  web and technology companies and other service providers with significant market presence and brand loyalty 
with our clients  our services are marketed to potential subscribers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
we anticipate this trend of our company funded marketing programs continuing into  particularly as our financial institution clients continue to request that we bear more of the new subscriber marketing costs as well as prepay commissions to them on new subscribers 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  we continued to expand our efforts to market our consumer products and services directly to consumers 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet and broadcast media 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing and email 
we expect to continue our investment in marketing in in our direct to consumer business 
our client arrangements are distinguished from one another by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these commissions could be payable upfront in a lump sum on a per subscriber basis for the subscriber s enrollment  periodically over the life of a subscriber  or through a combination of both 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements  we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client  and we may reimburse the client for certain of its out of pocket marketing costs incurred in obtaining the subscriber 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than that under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements and the ability to obtain subscribers and utilize marketing channels that the clients otherwise may not make available 
shared marketing arrangements under shared marketing arrangements  marketing expenses are shared by us and the client in various proportions  and we may pay a commission to or receive a service fee from the client 
revenue generally is split relative to the investment made by our client and us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect and shared marketing arrangements  provide that  after termination of the contract  we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers  for periods ranging from two years to no specific termination period  under the economic arrangements that existed at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements and some shared marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services under existing subscriptions 
clients under some contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us 
during the year ended december   we acquired membership agreements from citibank  which is recorded as a customer related intangible asset in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for million 
the acquisition increased our revenue and amortization expense over the useful life of the asset 
in the year ended december   we reviewed our estimates related to this intangible asset under us gaap and  based on the analysis  reduced the useful life of the asset from ten to seven years 
due to us experiencing greater than estimated attrition of our subscriber base  we also accelerated the amortization of the asset 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our direct and shared marketing arrangements have increased over the past three fiscal years as of december  in thousands indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers through our increased direct marketing efforts over the last few years  subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from direct marketing arrangements increased from in to in and to in the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days of subscription  as a percentage of new subscribers was higher during the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
the increase in cancellations in was driven by sales mix and sales from a partner  who is not a financial institution  which had higher than expected rate of disputed billing transactions 
in the three months ended december  we ceased sales with that partner 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in  in  and in the higher percentages in are primarily due a loss of approximately thousand subscribers from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  was in  in and in the retention rate decreased in primarily from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover 
revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients for the years ended december   and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship bank of america includes mbna shared direct marketing capital one direct and through equifax agreement indirect marketing citibank direct marketing citibank indirect marketing we have a master services agreement with equifax  which terminates in november  under which we provide various services to equifax in canada 
even if the master agreement is not terminated  however  either party may terminate the receipt of particular services from the other party on days prior notice 
with the exception of services to capital one customers acquired prior to january   and services related to equifax products in canada  we are not providing any services under that agreement 
prior to january   we provided our identity theft protection and credit management services under the master agreement with equifax to customers of capital one bank  or capital one  which marketed those services to consumers under an agreement between capital one and equifax 
on september   we entered into a marketing and services agreement with capital one under which  effective january   our services are marketed by capital one to its customers 
the services marketed to capital one customers under this agreement are substantially all of the services previously marketed through the master agreement between us and equifax  in addition to other services 
through our agreement with equifax  however  we continue to provide our services to the customers of capital one who enrolled for the services prior to january  on february   we received written notice from our client discover that  effective september   it was terminating the agreement for services administration between us and discover dated march   as amended the services agreement  including the omnibus amendment dated december  the omnibus amendment 
on the same date  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court for fairfax county  virginia 
the complaint sought a declaration that  if discover used  for its own purposes  credit report authorizations given by customers to intersections or discover  it would be in breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment to the services agreement 
in the complaint  intersections alleged that reliance on the credit report authorizations by discover or its new provider would be a breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment thereto  and thus sought a declaratory judgment to prevent discover from committing a breach of the parties contract 
a bench trial was held in the matter on february and   and on or about may   the court entered an order providing that the credit report authorizations may be used exclusively by intersections 
on june   discover notified the court that it was appealing the court s decision to the supreme court of virginia 
on august   discover notified the court that it was withdrawing their notice of appeal  thereby ending the case and giving full force and effect to the court s order entered may  we regularly re negotiate and adjust the products  retail pricing  pricing of our contracts  and marketing opportunities with our top five revenue producing clients 
we expect some of these changes to affect the sales volumes  sales mix and profitability of our client marketing programs 
in  we expect sales volumes to decrease  in part  due to these adjustments and also due to current economic conditions 
background screening in may  we created screening international  llc si with control risks group  ltd  crg  a company based in the uk  by combining our subsidiary  american background information services  inc abi with crg s background screening division 
prior to july   we owned of si and had the right to designate a majority of the five member board of directors 
crg owned of si 
as further described in note  on july   we and crg agreed to terminate the existing ownership agreement  we acquired crg s ownership interest in screening international  llc  and we formed sih  our wholly owned subsidiary  which became the sole owner of si 
through our subsidiary  sih  we provide a variety of risk management tools for the purpose of personnel and vendor background screening services  including criminal background checks  driving records  employment verification and reference checks  drug testing and credit history checks to businesses worldwide 
our background screening services integrate data from various automated sources throughout the world  additional manual research findings from employees and subcontractors  and internal business logic provided by both screening international and by our clients into reports that assist in decision making 
our background screening services are generally sold to corporate clients under contractual arrangements with individual per unit prices for specific service specifications 
due to substantial difference in both service specifications and associated data acquisition costs  prices for our background screening services vary significantly among clients and geographies 
our clients include leading us  uk and global companies in such areas as manufacturing  staffing and recruiting agencies  financial services  retail and transportation 
our clients are primarily located in the us and the uk 
several of our clients have operations in other countries  and use our services in connection with those operations 
we have other clients in various countries  and expect the number of these clients to increase as we develop our global background screening business 
because we currently service the majority of our clients through our operations in the us and the uk  we consider those two locations to be the sources of our business for purposes of allocating revenue on a geographic basis 
we have several clients that contribute greater than of this segment s revenue 
the loss of one of these clients could have a material adverse impact on this segment s financial results 
revenue through our largest client in and was and of the segment s revenue 
none of these clients constitutes or more of our consolidated revenue 
we generally market our background screening services to businesses through an internal sales force 
our services are offered to businesses on a local or global basis 
prices for our services vary based upon complexity of the services offered  the cost of performing these services and competitive factors 
control risks group  our former business partner  provides marketing assistance and services  and licenses certain trademarks to screening international under which our services are branded in certain geographic areas 
the license agreement for the trade name terminates in december and the marketing agreement terminates in may online brand protection through our subsidiary  net enforcers  we provide online brand protection services including online channel monitoring  auction monitoring  forum  blog and newsgroup monitoring and other services 
net enforcers services include the use of technology and operations staff to search the internet for instances of our clients brands and or specific products  categorize each instance as potentially threatening to our clients based upon client provided criteria  and report our findings back to our clients 
net enforcers also offers additional value added services to assist our clients to take actions to remediate perceived threats detected online 
net enforcers services are typically priced as monthly subscriptions for a defined set of monitoring services  as well as per transaction charges for value added communications services 
prices for our services vary based upon the specific configuration of services purchased by each client and range from several hundred dollars per month to tens of thousands of dollars per month 
bail bonds industry solutions through our subsidiary  captira analytical  we provide automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry 
these services include accounting  reporting  and decision making tools which allow bail bondsmen  general agents and sureties to run their offices more efficiently  to exercise greater operational and financial control over their businesses  and to make better underwriting decisions 
we believe captira analytical s services are the only fully integrated suite of bail bonds management applications of comparable scope available in the marketplace today 
captira analytical s services are sold to retail bail bondsman on a per seat license basis plus additional one time or recurring charges for various optional services 
captira analytical has also developed a suite of services for bail bonds insurance companies  general agents and sureties which are also sold on either a transactional or recurring revenue basis 
as captira analytical s business model is relatively new  pricing and service configurations are subject to change at any time 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our consolidated results of operations 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets we record  as goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in purchase transactions 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and follow the two step process 
we test goodwill annually as of october  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
as of december   goodwill of million and million resides in our consumer products and services and background screening reporting units  respectively 
there is no goodwill in our other reporting units in a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  b a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  c a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  d unanticipated competition  e the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and f slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using a combined income discounted cash flow valuation model and market based approach 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable companies 
the income approach measures the value of the reporting units by the present values of its economic benefits 
these benefits can include revenue and cost savings 
value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for use of funds  trends within the industry  and risks associated with particular investments of similar type and quality as of the valuation date 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections  and cost of capital discount rate 
the projections use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including business plans  growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill 
we estimate fair value giving consideration to both the income and market approaches 
consideration is given to the line of business and operating performance of the entities being valued relative to those of actual transactions  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying value to measure the amount of impairment charge  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of that reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as previously stated  we test our goodwill annually as of october  however  due to the deterioration in the general economic environment and the decline in our market capitalization  we concluded a triggering event had occurred at june  indicating potential impairment in our background screening reporting unit 
we determined  in the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis performed as of june   that goodwill in the background screening reporting unit was impaired 
as of june  the value under the income approach was developed by discounting the projected future cash flows to present value 
the reporting units discounted cash flows require significant management judgment with respect to revenue  earnings  capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are based on our annual business plan or other forecasted results of approximately five years 
the assumptions for our discounted future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance 
additionally  we considered the impact that known economic  industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts  as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new products  client service and retention standards 
examples of known economic and market trends that were considered in our consumer products and services reporting unit include the impact a weakened economy has had on our products associated with consumer credit card originations  which negatively impact subscriber growth  subscriber attrition  and mortgage billings for our products 
examples that were considered in our background screening reporting unit include the impact the higher unemployment rate has had on our application volumes  as well as reduced business spending 
discount rates reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations 
for the step one impairment test as of june   the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units ranged from to 
the discount rate for our consumer products and services reporting unit increased to as of june  from in our annual evaluation 
this slight increase from represents a slight decrease in the core business due to the challenging economic environment and its impact on our financial institution clients 
the discount rate for our background screening reporting unit was for the june  analysis 
the discount rate for this reporting unit was higher because there is inherent risk or volatility in the expected cash flows of this reporting unit 
this volatility is due to the reduced rate of growth in a less stable start up market and a weakened economic environment  coupled with the historical net losses within the reporting unit 
the long term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit for the year ended december   for the six months ended june  was 
this was based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
in our market based approach  a valuation multiple was selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit s operating result with the comparable companies information 
in addition to these financial considerations  qualitative factors such as business descriptions  business diversity  the size and operating performance  and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 
we used both an earnings before interest depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple and revenue multiple to estimate the fair value using a market approach 
at june   the consumer products and services reporting unit ebitda and revenue multiples were and  respectively 
the background screening and other reporting units revenue multiples were and  respectively 
however  the comparison of the values calculated using an equally weighted average between the income and market based approaches to our market capitalization resulted in a value significantly in excess of our market capitalization 
we therefore proportionally allocated the market capitalization  including a reasonable control premium  to the reporting units to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units 
based on the analysis as of june   the implied fair value of the consumer products and services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
the carrying value of our other reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value by  however  there is no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit as of june  the carrying value of our background screening reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value by approximately based on this analysis as of june   which resulted in an impairment of goodwill in our background screening reporting unit 
in the reporting units where the carrying value exceeded the fair value which had allocable goodwill  we included certain key assumptions in our discounted cash flows 
for the background screening reporting unit  we included assumptions for revenue and the impact the recessionary economy is having on worldwide hiring 
our revenue growth rates in later years are consistent with our historical operations for a mature business in a stronger economy 
as our operating margin has stabilized in this business  we expect it to grow in proportion to the revenue 
in addition  we made several key assumptions regarding the long term growth rate and discount rates in calculating an implied fair value see above for discussion 
the second step of the impairment test requires us to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the first step to the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets 
goodwill was written down to its implied fair value for our background screening reporting unit 
for the three months ended june   we recorded an impairment charge of million in our background screening reporting unit 
we then performed our required annual impairment test as of october  we utilized the june  values determined under the income and market based approaches for our annual impairment test as there were no significant changes in our business or circumstances or events that have changed since that prior valuation 
again at october   the comparison of the values calculated using an equally weighted average between the income and market based approaches to our market capitalization resulted in a value significantly in excess of our market capitalization 
we  therefore  proportionally allocated the market capitalization  including a reasonable control premium  to the reporting units to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units 
based on the analysis as of october   the implied fair value of the consumer products and services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
the carrying value of our other reporting units exceeded its implied fair value by  however  there is no remaining goodwill allocated to these reporting units 
the implied fair value of our background screening reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
therefore  at october   the estimated fair value of our consumer product and services and background screening reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
therefore  goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired and the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment of million in our background screening reporting unit and an impairment of and million in our online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions reporting units  respectively 
we performed the second step of the impairment analysis during the three months ended march  based on the finalization of this second step  we recorded an additional impairment charge of thousand in our background screening reporting unit in the three months ended march  we will continue to monitor our market capitalization  along with other operational performance measures and general economic conditions 
a downward trend in one or more of these factors could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of our reporting units and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
our consumer products and services reporting unit has million of remaining goodwill as of december  our background screening reporting unit has million of goodwill remaining as of december  a continued increase in the domestic and international unemployment rate will have an inverse effect on revenue and cash flow attributable to our background screening reporting unit as volume for new hire background screens will be reduced 
we may not be able to take sufficient cost containment actions to maintain our current operating margins in the future 
in addition  due to the concentration of our significant clients in the financial industry  any significant impact to a contract held by a major client may have an effect on future revenue which could lead to additional impairment charges 
we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  property and equipment and other long term assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the future cash flows for assets involved 
in conducting our analysis  we compared the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the net book value  the long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is measured and recognized 
an impairment charge is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows associated with these assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trademarks and customer  marketing and technology related intangibles 
such intangible assets  excluding customer related intangibles  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally three to ten years 
customer related intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line or accelerated basis  dependent upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
during the year ended december   we reviewed our estimates regarding a customer related intangible asset 
based upon the pattern of use of the underlying the asset  we accelerated the amortization of that asset and reduced the estimated useful life from ten to seven years 
this acceleration resulted in an additional million of amortization expense in the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   we record an impairment of thousand for intangible assets at our background screening  online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions segments and thousand for long lived assets at our bail bonds industry solutions segment 
during the year ended december   we record an impairment of million for intangible assets at our online brand protection segment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on identity theft  credit management and background services  accidental death insurance and other membership products and other monthly subscription products 
our products and services are offered to consumers principally on a monthly subscription basis 
subscription fees are generally billed directly to the subscriber s credit card  mortgage bill or demand deposit accounts 
the prices to subscribers of various configurations of our products and services range generally from to per month 
as a means of allowing customers to become familiar with our services  we sometimes offer free trial or guaranteed refund periods 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
identity theft  credit management and background services we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain signed contracts with all of our large financial institution customers and paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred once the product is transmitted over the internet  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as sales are generally based on contract or list prices and payments from large financial institutions are collected within days with no significant write offs  and d collectability is reasonably assured as individual customers pay by credit card which has limited our risk of non collection 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
for subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
we generate revenue from one time credit reports and background screenings which are recognized when the report is provided to the customer electronically  which is generally at the time of completion 
we also generate revenue through a collaborative arrangement which involves joint marketing and servicing activities 
we recognize our share of revenues and expenses from this arrangement 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service 
annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for discretionary subscription refunds is established based on our actual experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
we generally record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the risk of physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generally record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
accidental death insurance and other membership products we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred at the completion of a product trial period  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as the price of the product is agreed to by the customer as a condition of the sales transaction which established the sales arrangement  and d collectability is reasonably assured as evidenced by our collection of revenue through the monthly mortgage payments of our customers or through checking account debits to our customers accounts 
revenues from insurance contracts are recognized when earned 
marketing of our insurance products generally involves a trial period during which time the product is made available at no cost to the customer 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
for insurance products  we record revenue on a net basis as we perform as an agent or broker for the insurance products without assuming the risks of ownership of the insurance products 
for membership products  we generally record revenue on a gross basis as we serve as the primary obligor in the transactions  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we participate in agency relationships with insurance carriers that underwrite insurance products offered by us 
accordingly  insurance premiums collected from customers and remitted to insurance carriers are excluded from our revenues and operating expenses 
insurance premiums collected but not remitted to insurance carriers as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively  and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other monthly subscription products we generate revenue from other types of subscription based products provided from our online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions segments 
we recognize revenue from online brand protection and brand monitoring services  offered by net enforcers  on a monthly basis from providing management service solutions  offered by captira analytical  on a monthly subscription basis 
deferred subscription solicitation and advertising our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
we expense advertising costs the first time advertising takes place  except for direct response marketing costs 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response marketing costs  which are accounted for in accordance with us gaap 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
we amortize deferred subscription solicitation costs on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
commission costs commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed when incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions from our client 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of the subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
we have prepaid commission agreements with some of our clients 
under these agreements  we pay a commission on new subscribers in lieu of or a reduction in future commission payments 
we amortize these prepaid commissions  on an accelerated basis  over a period of time not to exceed three years  which is the average expected life of customers 
the short term portion of the prepaid commissions are shown in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of the prepaid commissions are shown in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization is included in commission expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
total deferred subscription solicitation costs included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the long term portion of the deferred subscription solicitation costs are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and include million for both the years ended december  and included in the current portion of the deferred subscription solicitation costs is the current portion of prepaid commissions which were million and million as of december  and  respectively

share based compensation we currently have three equity incentive plans  the and stock option plans and the stock incentive plan which provide us with the opportunity to compensate selected employees with stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
a stock option entitles the recipient to purchase shares of common stock from us at the specified exercise price 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus entitle the recipient to obtain stock or stock units  
par value  which vest over a set period of time 
rsus are granted at no cost to the employee and employees do not need to pay an exercise price to obtain the underlying common stock 
all grants or awards made under the plans are governed by written agreements between us and the participants 
on january   we adopted the provisions of stock option related guidance 
we elected to use the modified prospective method of implementation 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense for the year ended december  included compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value and compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to but unvested as of december  based on the grant date fair value 
in november  we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to determine the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital apic pool related to the tax effects of stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flow of the tax effects of stock based awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of stock option related guidance on january  we use the black scholes option pricing model to value all options and the straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each option granted has been estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected dividend yield expected volatility weighted average risk free interest rate weighted average expected life of options years years years expected dividend yield 
the black scholes valuation model requires an expected dividend yield as an input 
we have not issued dividends in the past nor do we expect to issue dividends in the future 
as such  the dividend yield used in our valuations for the years ended december   and was zero 
expected volatility 
the expected volatility of the options granted was estimated based upon the average volatility of comparable public companies  as well as our historical share price volatility 
we will continue to review our estimate in the future 
risk free interest rate 
the yield on actively traded non inflation indexed us treasury notes was used to extrapolate an average risk free interest rate based on the expected term of the underlying grants 
expected term 
the expected term of options granted during the years ended december   and was determined under the simplified calculation vesting term original contractual term 
for the majority of grants valued during these years ended  the options had graded vesting over years equal vesting of options annually and the contractual term was years 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures based on historical option and restricted stock unit activity on a grant by grant basis 
we may make changes to that estimate throughout the vesting period based on actual activity 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of us gaap  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if necessary  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to an amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
net loss for the years ended december  and included an income tax expense of thousand and an income tax benefit of million  respectively 
the income tax expense includes a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets generated in the current year of million 
the income tax benefit includes a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on cumulative federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of approximately thousand  thousand and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets are primarily related to federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that we believe cannot be utilized in the foreseeable future 
us gaap requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law 
as a matter of course  we may be audited by various taxing authorities and these audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
us gaap addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap provided guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
we determined that upon the conclusion of our tax examination  the respective tax positions were settled and we recognized various uncertain tax benefits as discrete events  which had an impact on our consolidated financial statements as of december  refer to note for further discussion of income taxes and the related impact 
foreign currency translation we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiary at the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period and the results of operations at the average rate throughout the period

our financial results for the year ended december  includes a net impact of million related to foreign currency transaction gain 
our financial results for the year ended december  includes a net impact of million related to foreign currency transaction losses 
for the year ended december   our financial results include million related to a foreign currency transaction gain

trends related to the current economic environment the weakened economy has had several notable effects on our businesses in  which will persist in first  new card issuances at our financial institution clients slowed  which translated into a reduction in subscriber additions in our consumer products and services segment 
this condition will carry over to second  charge or credit card delinquencies and card cancellations increased for certain of our services 
this trend may continue in third  some of our financial institution clients presented us opportunities to fund partner additional subscriber solicitation costs

interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this is primarily attributable to increased interest expense on a greater amount of outstanding long term debt

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments and consist primarily of short term us treasury securities with original maturity dates of less than or equal to days 
during the year ended december   we purchased short term us treasury securities with a maturity date greater than days of approximately million  which are classified as short term investments on our consolidated financial statements 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  including approximately million related to our background screening segment  compared to million  including approximately million related to our background screening segment  as of december  our accounts receivable balance consists primarily of credit card transactions that have been approved but not yet deposited into our account  several large balances with some of our top financial institutions clients and accounts receivable associated with background screening and other clients 
the likelihood of non payment has historically been remote with respect to subscriber based clients billed  however  we do provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to background screening clients and corporate brand protection clients 
given the events in the financial markets  we are continuing to monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to our financial institution obligors 
in addition  we provide for a refund allowance  which is included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  against transactions that may be refunded in subsequent months 
this allowance is based on historical results 
our sources of capital include  but are not limited to  cash and cash equivalents  cash from continuing operations  amounts available under the credit agreement and other external sources of funds 
our short term and long term liquidity depends primarily upon our level of net income  working capital management and bank borrowings 
we had a working capital surplus of million as of december  compared to million as of december  we believe that available short term and long term capital resources are sufficient to fund capital expenditures  working capital requirements  scheduled debt payments and interest and tax obligations for the next twelve months 
we expect to utilize our cash provided by operations to meet our funding needs and are not anticipating utilization of the capital markets or increasing our available borrowings over the next months

over the past year  as certain of our financial institution clients have requested that we bear more of the new subscriber marketing costs as well as prepay commissions to them on new subscribers  we have needed to use an increasing portion of our cash flow generated from operations to finance our business 
in the year ended december   net cash used in operations for deferred subscription solicitation costs was million 
we anticipate this trend to continue with our financial institution clients in for the year ended december   we expect our future cash flows may be impacted by prepaying these commissions 
we also expect that our future cash flows could be impacted by our agreements to pay more of the new subscriber marketing costs 
these agreements are short term in nature and are not a continuing contract because either party may generally terminate the agreements without cause at any time  without penalty 
due to the short term nature of these agreements  our clients could  at any time  re negotiate and at times have renegotiated any of the key terms  including price  marketing and commission arrangements 
our operating results will continue to be impacted by the non cash amortization of these prepaid commissions  as well as the amortization of the deferred subscription solicitation costs 
if we consent to the specific requests and choose to incur the costs  we may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to operate and expand our business 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional funds on favorable terms  or at all  which could materially adversely affect our business  strategy and financial condition  including losses of or changes in the relationships with one or more of our clients

on july   we entered into a million credit agreement with bank of america  na credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of a revolving credit facility in the amount of million and a term loan facility in the amount of million with interest at over libor 
on january   we amended the credit agreement in order to increase the term loan facility to million 
in july  we entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment related to the termination and ongoing operations of screening international  including the formation of a new domestic subsidiary that will not join in the credit agreement as a co borrower  and to clarify other matters related to the termination and the ongoing operations of screening international 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment increased our interest rate by one percent at each pricing level such that the interest rate now ranges from to over libor 
in addition  the amendment increased our ability to invest additional funds into screening international  as well as require a portion of the proceeds from any disposition of that entity to be paid to bank of america  na see note for additional information

we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
in  we entered into certain interest rate swap transactions that convert our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
our interest rate swaps are related to variable interest rate risk exposure associated with our long term debt and are intended to manage this risk 
the counterparty to our derivative agreements is a major financial institution for which we continually monitor its position and credit ratings 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by this financial institution 
the interest rate swaps on our outstanding term loan and a portion of our outstanding revolving line of credit have initial notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the swaps modify our interest rate exposure by effectively converting the variable rate on our term loan at december  to a fixed rate of per annum through december and on our revolving line of credit at december  to a fixed rate of per annum through december the notional amount of the term loan interest rate swap amortizes on a monthly basis through december and the notional amount of the line of credit interest rate swap amortizes to million for the year ended both swaps terminate in december we use the monthly libor interest rate and have the intent and ability to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings 
accordingly  we do not recognize any ineffectiveness on the swaps as allowed us gaap 
for the year ended december   there was no material ineffective portion of the hedge and therefore  no impact to the consolidated statements of operations

the amendment provides that the maturity date for the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility under the credit agreement will be december  the amendment also amends certain financial covenants which we are required to maintain compliance with under the credit agreement  including consolidated leverage ratio covenants  and provides new mandatory term loan prepayments based on excess cash flow and the sale or issuance of equity interests  provides a new amortization schedule for the term loan and revises the acquisition covenant to reduce permitted costs of acquisitions 
this does not include interest expense 
in addition  we have a thousand non interest bearing note to control risk group  as a result of the purchase of the noncontrolling interest of screening international  llc and it is classified as long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
other arrangements include payments related to agreements to a service provider under which we receive data and other information for use in our new fraud protection services 
under these arrangements we pay based on usage of the data or analytics  and make certain minimum payments in exchange for defined limited exclusivity rights 
we entered into a new agreement with a non credit data provider  effective december   under which we will receive enhanced data and services and improved licensing terms 
in addition  minimum noncanceable payments by us to this provider under the new agreement will be lower than under the old agreement by million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  we are obligated to pay approximately thousand to a related party under contracts through december  the amounts in the table represent only the noncanceable portion of each respective arrangement 
in general  contracts can be terminated with day notice

related to the unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded accrued interest of thousand 
as part of the acquisition of net enforcers  we are obligated to pay additional consideration of up to million in cash if net enforcers achieves certain financial statement metrics and revenue targets in the future 
we may be liable for these additional payments in the future  however  we believe this is unlikely to be the case 
fair value we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
