please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and item a risk factors for a discussion of risks involved with our operations 
merchant services overview our merchant acquiring services are similar around the world in that we accept a variety of card payments at the point of sale 
we conduct our merchant acquiring business using two different business models direct and indirect 
in the direct model  merchants are our end customers 
we provide our merchant customers with the ability to accept card based and check payments 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services 
we sell our services through multiple sales channels around the world and target customers in many vertical industries 
card based payment forms consist of credit  debit  gift  stored value  and electronic benefits transfer cards 
credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the world s major international card brands  including american express  china union pay  discover  jcb  mastercard  and visa  as well as certain domestic debit networks  such as interac in canada 
credit and debit card processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card as the form of payment 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant  the credit and debit networks and the financial institutions that issue cards 
our comprehensive offerings include terminal sales and deployment  front end authorization processing  settlement and funding processing  full customer support and help desk functions  chargeback resolution  industry compliance  pci security  consolidated billing and statements  and on line reporting 
our value proposition is to provide high quality  responsive  secure and full end to end service to all of our customers 
currently  we market direct merchant services in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the asia pacific region and the russian federation 
indirect merchant services provides the same basic products and services as our direct merchant services model  primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of isos on an unbundled basis  that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
these services are marketed in the united states  canada and parts of eastern europe  primarily in the czech republic and the russian federation 
we also offer sales  installation and servicing of atm and point of sale pos terminals  and selected card issuing services such as card management and personalization  and provide payment processing for atm providers and card issuers  through global payments europe and zao united card service ucs  which are also components of indirect merchant services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a specified fee per transaction 
in both merchant services models  we also charge other fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
merchant acquirers are typically financial institutions or independent processors like global payments 
global payments performs a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  file transfers to facilitate the funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into an electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card networks  primarily visa  mastercard  and discover  use a system known as interchange in the case of credit and signature debit cards for this purpose 
financial institutions use the debit networks for pin based debit cards to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and merchant acquirers to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
debit card payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based debit transactions are sent through a debit network while signature based debit or check card transactions  which are offered exclusively in the united states  are sent through visa and mastercard and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based debit transactions typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based debit  or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card transaction posts to a cardholder s account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
in order to provide credit and signature based debit card transaction processing services  we must be designated as a certified processor by mastercard and visa in addition to being a merchant service provider by mastercard and an independent sales organization by visa 
currently  these designations are dependent upon member clearing banks of either organization sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard networks 
a financial institution that is a member of the visa and or mastercard card networks which we refer to in this discussion as member must sponsor an electronic transaction payment processor such as global payments 
we have five primary financial institution sponsors in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the asia pacific region and the russian federation with whom we have sponsorship or depository and processing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route visa and mastercard transactions under the member banks control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard 
visa and mastercard set the standards with which we must comply 
we also provide credit card transaction processing for discover financial services or discover card discover and are designated as an acquirer by discover 
this designation provides us with a direct relationship between us and discover  and therefore a member sponsorship is not required 
our agreement with discover allows us to route and clear transactions directly through discover s network 
otherwise  we process discover transactions similarly to the way we process mastercard and visa transactions 
discover publishes acquirer operating regulations with which we must comply 
we use our members to assist in funding merchants for discover transactions 
how a card transaction works a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pos terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments 

table of contents 
index to financial statements alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a value added reseller 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date and value of the goods or services purchased 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network through the internet or other communication in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits 
we route the request to the applicable credit or debit network 
the credit or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds 
timing differences  interchange expenses  merchant reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card networks and the amount funded to the merchants 
the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds  and  instead  require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant is funded 
however  in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our members  we generally follow a net settlement process whereby  if the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member s funding obligation to the merchant  we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member  in a joint deposit account or in an account at the member bank  and record a corresponding liability 
conversely  if the member s funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card networks  the amount of the member s net receivable position is either subsequently advanced to the member by us or the member satisfies this obligation with its own funds 
if the member uses its own funds  the member assesses a funding cost 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  on a credit card transaction  the card issuer may fund the member after retaining approximately referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder s monthly credit card bill 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require global payments to advance the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including the network and systems cost to process the transaction including assessments and commissions paid to our sales force or iso 
assessments are fees charged by visa and mastercard based on the dollar value of transactions processed through their networks 
north america merchant services segment north america merchant services revenues represent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues and include operations in the united states and canada 
in the united states  we sell our services via isos  a direct sales force  trade associations  agent and var referral arrangements  as well as proprietary telesales groups 
our iso channel targets a variety of merchant types with typical annual bankcard volumes of  or less 
the isos contract with global payments to provide processing and other services depending on the isos requirements 
these contracts are multi year and priced by service on a per transaction basis 
the isos act as a third party sales group selling global payments branded merchant acquiring products and services  with the majority of global s isos marketing direct merchant acquiring 
because global payments is a primary party to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the merchant contract as a result of our bank sponsor relationship  the full amount of fees collected from the merchant is recorded as revenue 
the excess of revenue earned over the iso contractual transaction fee plus assessments is remitted to the iso in the form of a residual payment on a monthly basis and is recorded in sales  general and administrative expenses 
our direct sales channel receives qualified leads from our agent bank  value added reseller and trade association referral partners signing a variety of mid to large sized merchants with annual bankcard volume on average above  our sales force is paid a combination of base salary and commission 
our united states revenue also includes check and gaming services and indirect merchant services 
our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of our verification and recovery offerings  or risk elimination  in the case of our guarantee offerings  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
our check services products are part of our direct merchant service offering 
check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
this service guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified 
if a verified check is dishonored  our service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services 
while we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter  we have historically recovered less than of the guaranteed checks 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that these services do not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
we derive revenues for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check and fees charged to merchants for specialized services such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip lightspeed proprietary software and vip preferred advantage product provide the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for a casino s customers 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase the flow of money to their gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value 
in canada we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force leveraging our bank referral relationships 
unlike the united states  approximately of payment transactions in canada are pin based debit transactions  primarily through interac 
international merchant services segment international merchant services revenues represent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues and include operations in europe and the asia pacific region 
our business in europe is primarily located in the united kingdom  the czech republic and the russian federation 
our asia pacific region includes the following eleven countries and territories brunei  china  hong kong  india  macau  malaysia  maldives  the philippines  singapore  sri lanka and taiwan 
we have a direct sales force in the united kingdom  the russian federation and the asia pacific region through which we primarily sell our direct merchant acquiring services while leveraging our bank referral relationships 
in the czech republic and the russian federation we also provide indirect merchant acquiring services

generally  the payment processing market in the united states and canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers such as global payments 
we believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage and retrieval of information 
based on the nilson report  dated march  we are a leading mid market and small market merchant acquirer in the united states and we compete with first data corporation  bank of america merchant services  chase paymentech and elavon 
in canada  we have a significant market share second to our primary competitor  moneris solutions 
moneris solutions is a joint venture between the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
we also consider chase paymentech solutions and td merchant services to be major competitors in the canadian market 
in the european and asia pacific regions  financial institutions remain the dominant providers of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of merchant processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
our primary competitors in the united kingdom are the royal bank of scotland and barclays 
the russian federation payments market is highly fragmented and our competition is made up of various financial institutions  including sberbank  alfa bank  vtb  raiffeisen bank  and russian standard bank 
in the czech republic  our primary competitors are first data  sinsys  and euronet 
in the asia pacific region  our primary competition is from financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services as well as merchant solutions  which is a joint venture between first data and standard chartered plc 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally 
this expansion has come in the form of acquisitions and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing industry will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in the canadian market  visa  mastercard and interac are planning to migrate to cards containing chip technology over the coming years 
chip card technology is already prevalent in the european and asia pacific markets 
chip technology provides the ability to process payment transactions securely by protecting the cardholder information in an encrypted and confidential manner 
the chip is difficult to copy and has the additional capacity to be personalized by a card issuer  including the ability to be programmed with spending and usage limits  making it possible to authorize some transactions off line 
chip technology can also help enable a variety of additional card features including applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards and public transit passes 
we expect that it will take multiple years for all participants to implement the equipment necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the canadian marketplace 
we have a plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
we are well into the enablement of chip card technology for company owned terminals in the canadian market 
we believe the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help our customers reduce their transaction costs and accelerate the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
if new technologies like radio frequency identification or contactless payment cards continue to evolve and are desired by merchants and consumers  we plan to continue developing new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as quick service restaurants  government  recurring payments  and business to business should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
target markets we believe that significant global opportunities exist for growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing services 
although the united states accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world  global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments of the role of payment cards in facilitating economic growth are rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global opportunity 
the growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the rapid growth in the utilization of debit cards  correlates with the historic growth of our business 
according to the nilson report dated april  worldwide annual general purpose card purchase volume increased to trillion in general purpose cards include the major card networks brands such as visa  mastercard  american express  discover  china union pay  jcb  and diners club 
in canada  general purpose cards also include interac debit cards

index to financial statements item a risk factors our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship 
in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services  we must be registered as a merchant processor of mastercard and visa 
these designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations 
if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us  we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to establish our own wholly owned financial institution in such region that could serve as a sponsor  either of which could prove to be difficult and or more expensive 
if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship whether through a third party or through the establishment of our own wholly owned financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to the affected customers which would negatively impact our revenues and earnings 
in june  canadian imperial bank of commerce  cibc  provided us with notice that it would not renew our agreement with them  under which cibc provides sponsorship for visa in canada  after the expiration of the initial ten year term 
as a result  our canadian visa sponsorship will expire in march we are pursuing alternatives to cibc s sponsorship  including filing an application with the canadian regulatory authorities for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in canada which could serve as our financial institution sponsor and negotiating with other financial institutions 
the failure to establish a wholly owned loan company that can serve as our visa sponsor in canada or to secure a new sponsorship relationship with another financial institution that would replace the arrangement that we currently have with cibc would likely result in the loss of visa merchant customers in canada and lead to a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks  they could seek to fine us  suspend us or terminate our registrations 
if our merchants or isos incur fines or penalties that we cannot collect  we could end up bearing them 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  several of our subsidiaries are registered with visa and mastercard as service providers for member institutions and with other networks 
as such  we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions 
the rules of the card networks are set by their boards  which may be influenced by banks that own their stock and  in the case of discover by the card issuers  and some of those banks and issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services 
the termination of our registrations or our status as a service provider  or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards  including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards  that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks  it could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks 
if we cannot collect such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso  we could end up bearing such fines or penalties  resulting in lower earnings for us 
security breaches could harm our reputation and adversely affect future earnings we collect and store sensitive data about merchants  including names  addresses  social security numbers  drivers license numbers  and checking account numbers 
in addition  we maintain a database of cardholder data relating to specific transactions  including bankcard numbers  in order to process the transactions and for fraud prevention 
we process that data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third party service providers 
although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats designed to breach our systems in order to gain access to confidential information or our intellectual property

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems  software  data center and telecommunications networks  as well as the systems and services of third parties 
our systems and operations or those of our third party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from  among other things  fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist acts  war  unauthorized entry  human error  and computer viruses or other defects 
our property and business interruption insurance may not be applicable or adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur

we perform the vast majority of disaster recovery operations ourselves  though we utilize select third parties for some aspects of recovery 
to the extent we outsource our disaster recovery  we are at risk of the vendor s unresponsiveness in the event of breakdowns in our systems 
utility and system interruptions could adversely affect our operations 
in order to process transactions promptly  our computer equipment and network servers must be functional on a hour basis  which requires access to telecommunications facilities and the availability of electricity  which are susceptible to disruption 
any resulting disruptions in our processing services could cause us to incur substantial additional expense and the loss of customers  which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 
we may experience software defects  undetected errors  and development delays  which could damage customer relations  decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 
our products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays  and the underlying software may contain undetected errors or defects 
defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  loss of credibility with current or potential customers  harm to our reputation  or exposure to liability claims 
in addition  we rely on technologies supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors  viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
loss of key independent sales organizations could reduce our revenue growth 
our iso sales channel  which purchases and resells our end to end services to its own portfolio of merchant customers  is a strong contributor to our revenue growth in our north america merchant services segment 
if an iso switches to another transaction processor  shuts down or becomes insolvent  we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso  and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso  all of which could negatively affect our revenues and earnings 

table of contents 
index to financial statements risks associated with operations outside the united states could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency 
we are subject to the risk that currency exchange rates between these regions and the united states will fluctuate  potentially resulting in a loss of some of our revenue and earnings when such amounts are exchanged into united states dollars 
volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 
for example  for fiscal year  currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our revenues by million and our earnings by per diluted share 
we do not use forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange risk 
in addition  in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into united states dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions 
the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of our products and services offered to our customers  our ability to develop new technologies  and our ability to complete acquisitions 
we operate in the electronic payments market  which is highly competitive 
our primary competitors in these markets include other independent processors  as well as financial institutions  independent sales organizations  and  potentially  card networks 
many of our competitors are companies who are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have 
in addition  our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with the card networks 
these factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well 
either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies  including internet payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers  again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings 
lastly  our competitors may be willing or able to pay more than us for acquisitions  which may cause us to lose certain acquisitions that we would otherwise desire to complete 
we are subject to the business cycles and credit risk of our merchant customers and our independent sales organizations 
the current recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings  resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us 
our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder 
our merchants and isos are also liable for any fines  or penalties  that may be assessed by any card networks 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amounts from the merchants or isos  due to merchant fraud  breach of contract  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such charges  resulting in lower earnings for us 
risks associated with reduced levels of consumer spending could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
significant portions of our revenue and earnings are derived from fees from processing consumer credit card and debit card transactions 
we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence  consumer spending  consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits 
a general 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reduction in consumer spending in the united states or any other country where we do business could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
for example  in fiscal year compared to the prior year  our united states direct credit card average dollar value of transaction  or average ticket  decreased by approximately 
we believe this decline  while partially due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our isos  was in part driven by lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy 
a further weakening in the economy could also force retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines 
additionally  credit card issuers have been reducing credit limits  closing accounts  and are more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards 
we incur chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers 
we cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event a billing dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder 
if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant s account or reserve account if applicable  or if the merchant refuses or is unable  due to closure  bankruptcy or other reasons  to reimburse us for a chargeback  we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder 
the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment 
we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future 
any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have potential liability for fraudulent bankcard transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others 
examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit bankcard or card number to record a false sales transaction  processes an invalid bankcard  or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction 
criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit and fraud 
while we have systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of fraud  we cannot assure the effectiveness of these measures 
it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future 
failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability or other liability 
increases in chargebacks or other liability could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings  we must continually update our products and services  a process which could result in increased research and development costs in excess of historical levels and the loss of revenues  earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 
the electronic payments market in which we compete is subject to rapid and significant technological changes 
these markets are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
in order to remain competitive  we are continually involved in a number of research and development projects including the development of a new front end platform for electronic payments processing 
these projects carry the risks associated with any research and development effort  including cost overruns  delays in delivery and performance problems 
in the electronic payments markets these risks are even more acute 
our markets are constantly experiencing rapid technological change 
any delay in the delivery of new products or services or the failure to differentiate our products and services could render them less desirable to our customers  or possibly even obsolete 
in addition  the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions  all at very high volumes and processing speeds 
any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements significant processing or reporting errors or other losses 
as a result of these factors  our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 
we also rely in part on third parties  including some of our competitors and potential competitors  for the development and access to new technologies 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 
in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability  we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments markets and also expand into new markets 
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing  and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion  we are continually looking for acquisition opportunities  investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition  investment and alliance candidates in the future  and if we do  they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
once completed  investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market 
we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets 
if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments markets  we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 
any new or changes made to laws  regulations  card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results 
we are subject to regulations that affect the electronic payments industry in the countries in which we operate 
regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years 
failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration  the limitation  suspension or termination of service  and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  including fines which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
for example  we are subject to the card network rules of visa  mastercard  and other card networks  interac  and of various debit networks  applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks  the payment services directive in europe  the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canada s department of finance housing assistance tax act of  which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities starting in  to name a few 
we are also subject to examination by the ffeic as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions 
interchange fees which are typically paid by the acquirer to the issuer in connection with transactions are subject to increasingly intense legal  regulatory  and legislative scrutiny worldwide 
for instance  in the united states  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has recently been signed into law to regulate the fees charged or received by issuers for processing debit transactions 
regulatory actions such as these  even if not directed at us  may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers 
we cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition 
changes to legal rules and regulations  or interpretation or enforcement thereof  could have a negative financial effect on our business 
in addition  even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations  as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness  could damage our business or our reputation 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increases in credit card network fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings 
from time to time  the card networks  including visa and mastercard  increase the fees interchange and assessment fees that they charge processors such as us 
we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers  but this strategy might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases 
if competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future  we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings 
the integration and conversion of our acquired operations  or other future acquisitions  if any  could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved  a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process  and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 
the acquisition  integration  and conversion of businesses involves a number of risks 
core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company s people  products  technology  and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including  for example managing geographically separated organizations  systems  and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  complying with foreign regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  difficulty entering new foreign markets due to  among other things  customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets  and general economic and political conditions 
if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly  the following factors  amongst others  could reduce our revenues and earnings  increase our operating costs  and result in a loss of projected synergies if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans  duties and responsibilities  and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business  we could lose employees to our competitors in the region  which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration  if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services  or the quality of those services  we could lose customers to our competitors  which would reduce our revenues and earnings  and the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets 
there may be a decline in the use of credit cards as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general 
if consumers do not continue to use credit cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash  credit cards and debit cards which is adverse to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we believe future growth in the use of credit cards will be driven by the cost  ease of use  and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses 
in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability  consumers and businesses must continue to use credit cards 
moreover  if there is an adverse development in the credit card industry in general  such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for our customers to do business  our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth 
the current recessionary environment has resulted in multiple bank failures and government encouraged consolidation 
as banks continue to consolidate  our ability to offer our services through indirect channels successfully will depend in part on whether the institutions that survive are willing to outsource their credit and debit card processing to third party vendors and whether those institutions have pre existing relationships with any of our competitors 
larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing transaction processing industry  and the selected markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our key personnel  would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain additional qualified management and technical personnel as we grow 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
our financial results may be adversely affected if we have to impair our intangible assets or goodwill 
as a result of our acquisitions  a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  together accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of may  and may   respectively 
we may not realize the full fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions  which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired 
under current accounting rules  any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
for example  during fiscal year we recorded a pre tax charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of our money transfer business  which we sold during fiscal year additional impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 
we have established contingent liabilities for tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority 
while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability 
an unfavorable resolution  therefore  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates 
changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our results of operations 
for example  we have net deferred tax assets associated with our uk business of million 
the measurement of such deferred tax assets is based  in part  on the current enacted corporate tax in the uk of 
the uk budget announced june  includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from to over the course of four financial years from april upon enactment of these tax rates  which is expected during the first half of our fiscal year  we estimate that we will record a reduction of our uk deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision of approximately million

index to financial statements we may become subject to additional united states  state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services customers  in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services 
application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic 
if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers  our costs will increase  reducing our earnings 
we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to value added taxes in europe 
changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive  the amount of our cash flow  and have a material adverse impact on our business 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
further  this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete 
in the united kingdom and certain markets in the asia pacific region  hsbc performs payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to transition services agreements 
we expect that hsbc will continue to provide these services until we integrate these functions into our operations 
until we can integrate the acquisitions financial reporting functions into our own  we will rely on hsbc to provide financial data  such as revenue billed to merchants  to assist us with compiling our accounting records 
accordingly  our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected  or are reasonably likely to be materially affected  by hsbc internal controls and procedures 
in order to mitigate this risk  we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by hsbc 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price
