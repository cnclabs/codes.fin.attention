the personnel in each hotel report to the general manager of the hotel 
each general manager reports to our executive vice president of operations 
the corporate office provides support directly to certain functions at the hotel such as sales  marketing and revenue management 
this organizational structure allows for each property to operate in a responsive and dynamic fashion while ensuring integrity of our guest experience and core values 
as we have expanded in our existing markets  we have begun to regionalize certain operational  finance and sales functions 
our management team is headquartered in new york city and coordinates our management and operations 
the management team reviews business contracts  oversees the financial budgeting and forecasting for our hotels  performs internal accounting and audit functions  administers insurance plans and identifies new systems and procedures to employ within our hotels to improve efficiency and profitability 
in addition  the management team is responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing activities at each of our hotels  designing sales training programs  tracking future business prospects and identifying  employing and monitoring marketing programs 
the management team is also responsible for the design of our hotels and overall product and service quality levels 
our engaging dynamic guest experience  or edge  service program  which we updated in  has been implemented across our portfolio  with the exception of hard rock 
this program is designed to enhance employee initiative and responsiveness which we believe results in high customer satisfaction 
our edge initiative further allows the sharing of best practices and expertise across our employee base  creating a culture that we believe is more service oriented than many of our competitors 
at hard rock  comparable service initiatives which incorporate the spirit of edge are in place and continuously assessed to ensure they meet our brand standards 
restaurant joint ventures as a central element of our operating strategy  we focus significant resources on identifying exciting and creative restaurant concepts 
consistent with this objective and to further enhance the dining experience offered by our hotels  we have established joint venture relationships with well known restaurateur jeffrey chodorow to develop  own and operate restaurants and bars at certain of the hotels we operate 
as of december   these joint ventures operated the restaurants including in room dining  banquet catering and other food and beverage operations at morgans  delano south beach  mondrian los angeles  clift  st martins lane  sanderson  and mondrian south beach as well as the bars in delano south beach  st martins lane and sanderson 
marketing  sales and public relations strong direct sales have been an integral part of our success 
as of december   we employed a sales force of greater than people with multiple sales managers stationed in each of our markets 
the sales force has global responsibility for sourcing business for our hotels 
the sales teams are deployed by industry focus and geography 
in  we derived approximately of our business from corporate transient and group accounts 
our core corporate business comes from the technology  financial services  entertainment  advertising  fashion and consumer goods industries 
unlike many hotel companies  our sales managers are trained to sell the experience  not simply the rate 
by branding the experience we showcase the kind of creativity that happens inside our hotels and prove that our guests come to us for much more than just a room or a bed 
our objective is to create differentiation by selling an experience and brand 

table of contents while marketing initiatives are customized in order to account for local preferences and market conditions  consistent major campaign and branding concepts are utilized throughout all our marketing activities 
these concepts are developed by our central sales and marketing teams  but a significant amount of discretion is left to the local sales managers who are often more able to promptly respond to local changes and market trends and to customize marketing concepts to meet each hotel s specific needs 
we place significant emphasis on branded communication strategies that are multi layered and non traditional 
our public relations and social networking outreach strategy is a highly cost effective marketing tool for us 
through highly publicized events  prospective guests are more likely to be made aware of our hotels through word of mouth or magazine  newspaper articles or social networking entries and high profile events rather than direct advertising 
this publicity is supplemented with focused marketing activities to our existing customers 
our in house marketing and public relations team coordinates the efforts of third party public relations firms to promote our properties through travel magazines and various local  national and international newspaper travel sections 
we regularly host events that attract celebrity guests and journalists generating articles in newspapers and magazines around the world 
our marketing efforts also include hosting other special events which have included events for art basel miami  the academy awards  the grammy s and fashion week in new york and london 
integration and centralization efforts we have centralized certain aspects of our operations in an effort to provide further revenue growth and reduce operating costs 
we continuously assess our technological tools and processes and seek to employ current and cutting edge tools 
for example  in we launched an updated website  www 
morganshotelgroup 
com  which provides our guests with a unique and distinctive booking experience  while offering a lower cost to reserve rooms than previously offered 
the new website  unlike any other hotel company s website  offers a more immersive experience to its visitors through the use of film  lifestyle photography and updated localized content specific to each hotel

during  our website generated approximately of our total bookings and approximately of our total rooms revenue 
in addition  we continue to expand our social media programs globally and with targeted local positioning in key networks 
in an effort to reduce expenses and to drive revenue growth  we employ what we believe to be the state of the art systems available to the hospitality industry 
these include our property management system our property management system provides management solutions to improve operations and profitability for a global hotel organization 
our property management system is designed for comprehensive guest management by  among other things  allowing the user to track and retrieve information pertaining to guests  groups and company accounts 
additional features of this system allow the user to extract information on a customized basis from its customer database 
we believe that this increases the possibility of maximizing revenue by allowing us to efficiently respond and cater to guest demands and trends and decreases expenses by centralizing the information database in an easy to use format 
central reservations system our central reservations system and related distribution and reservations services provide hotel reservations related services and technology 
central reservations office our central reservations office provides contact management solutions

this centralized database tracks guest sales history and guest preferences to provide our staff in our hotels and sales agents with a method of efficiently responding to and targeting guest needs 
competition we believe competition in the hospitality industry reflects a highly fragmented group of owners and operators offering a wide range of quality and service levels 
our hotels compete with other hotels in their respective locations that operate in the same segments of the hospitality market 
these segments consist of traditional hotels in the luxury sector and boutique hotels in the same local area 
competitive factors include quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
we compete by providing a differentiated combination of location  design  amenities and service 
we are constantly striving to enhance the experience and service we are providing for our guests and have a continuing focus on improving our customer experience 
insurance we bid out our insurance programs to obtain the most competitive coverage and pricing 
we believe our programs provide coverage of the insurable risks facing our business that are consistent with or exceed industry standards 
we provide insurance coverage for our owned hotels and all of our operated properties  with the exception of the shore club  san juan beach and water club  hotel las palapas and hard rock  which are all discussed below  including all risk property  terrorism  commercial general liability  umbrella excess liability  workers compensation and employers liability  pollution legal liability  blanket crime  employment practices liability and fiduciary liability policies for which we are the named insured

coverage includes protection for securities claims 
we believe that the premiums we pay and the insurance coverages we maintain are reasonable and consistent with comparable businesses of our size and risk profile 
our insurance policies require annual renewal 
given current trends  our insurance expense may increase in the foreseeable future

under the americans with disabilities act  or ada  all public accommodations are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in although significant amounts have been invested to ensure that our hotels comply with ada requirements  a determination that our hotels are not in compliance with the ada could result in a judicial order requiring compliance  imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all statutory and administrative government regulations with respect to our business 
our hotel properties expose us to possible environmental liabilities  including liabilities related to activities that predated our acquisition or operation of a property 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damages and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
environmental liability can be incurred by a current owner or operator of a property for environmental problems or violations that occurred on a property prior to acquisition or operation 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 
the owner or operator of a site may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site 

table of contents all of our properties have been subject to environmental site assessments  or esas  prepared by independent third party professionals 
these esas were intended to evaluate the environmental conditions of these properties and included a site visit  a review of certain records and public information concerning the properties  the preparation of a written report and  in some cases  invasive sampling 
we obtained the esas before we acquired our hotels to help us identify whether we might be responsible for cleanup costs or other environmental liabilities 
the esas on our properties did not reveal any environmental conditions that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  and results of operations or liquidity 
however  esas do not always identify all potential problems or environmental liabilities 
consequently  we may have material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  it is possible that future laws  ordinances or regulations could impose material environmental liabilities  or that the current environmental condition of our properties could be adversely affected by third parties or by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations in all material aspects

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below are risks that we believe are material to investors who purchase or own our securities 
you should consider carefully the following risks  together with the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  and the descriptions included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
risks related to our business the recent crisis in the financial markets and contraction of the economy have weakened  and could further weaken  demand for travel  hotels  dining and entertainment  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
us and global financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions in and  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability 
us and global economies also contracted significantly in  reducing the amounts people spend on travel  hotels  dining and entertainment 
lodging demand weakened significantly during the last quarter of and throughout  and we believe it will remain weak in until current economic trends reverse course 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we have substantial debt  and we may incur additional indebtedness  which may negatively affect our business and financial results 
as of december   we had million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness  including capital lease obligations 
our share of indebtedness held by our joint venture entities  which is generally non recourse to us  with the exception of certain standard carve out guarantees  was approximately million as of december  our substantial debt may negatively affect our business and operations in several ways  including requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest  which will reduce funds available for operations and capital expenditures  future business opportunities and other purposes  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns  such as the one we are currently experiencing  and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations  capital or to finance development projects or acquisitions in the future  and requiring us to dispose of properties in order to make required payments of interest and principal 
we also will likely incur additional debt in connection with any future acquisitions 
however  the tightening of the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing 
we may  therefore  in some instances  borrow under our amended revolving credit facility or borrow other funds to acquire properties 
in addition  we may incur further mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by the properties we acquire or our existing portfolio 
our working capital and liquidity reserves may not be adequate to cover all of our cash needs and we may have to obtain additional debt financing 
sufficient financing may not be available or  if available  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
additional borrowings for working capital purposes will increase our interest expense  and therefore may harm our business and operations 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
if we increase our leverage  the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and harm our business and operations 

table of contents we anticipate that we will need to refinance our indebtedness from time to time to repay our debt  and our inability to refinance on favorable terms  or at all  could harm our business and operations 
we have million of mortgages and mezzanine debt  excluding million on a hotel held for non sale disposition  on several of our hotel properties to secure our indebtedness  including  as of december   million on hudson and mondrian los angeles which matures on july  properties held by our joint venture entities are also subject to mortgages and mezzanine debt  including  as of december   million  or approximately million  on sanderson and st martins lane  which matures on november  since we anticipate that our internally generated cash will be inadequate to repay our indebtedness prior to maturity  we expect that we will be required to repay debt from time to time through refinancings of our indebtedness and or offerings of equity or debt 
the amount of our existing indebtedness and the continued tightness in the credit markets may harm our ability to repay our debt through refinancings 
in addition  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of any refinancing result in higher interest rates on any refinancing  our interest expense would increase  which could harm our business and operations 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to sell one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to us 
we did not repay the mortgage and mezzanine financing on one of our properties upon maturity  and in the future we may elect to cease making payments on additional mortgages or sell a property at a loss if it fails to generate cash flow to cover its debt service or we are unable to refinance the mortgage at maturity  which could result in foreclosure proceedings  negative publicity and reduce the number of properties we own  as well as our revenues  and could negatively affect our ability to obtain loans or raise equity or debt financing in the future 
we did not repay the million non recourse mortgage and mezzanine financing on mondrian scottsdale when it matured on june   and the lender has begun foreclosure proceedings on the property and terminated the management agreement effective march  in the future  we or our joint venture entities may cease making payments on the mortgages on one or more of our properties if the property fails to generate cash flow to cover its debt service or if we or the joint venture entity are unable to refinance the mortgage at maturity 
to the extent we or our joint venture entity does not meet debt service obligations and we or the joint venture entity defaults on a mortgage or other loan  the lender may have the right to exercise various remedies under the loan documents  including foreclosing on the applicable property 
foreclosure on a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our operating results 
lenders may assert numerous claims and take various actions against us  including  without limitation  seeking a deficiency judgment 
foreclosures may also create a negative public perception of us  resulting in a diminution of our brand value  and may negatively impact our ability to obtain loans or raise equity or debt financing in the future 
foreclosure actions may also require a substantial amount of resources and negotiations  which may divert the attention of our executive officers from other activities  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a foreclosure may also result in increased tax costs to us if we recognize income upon foreclosure 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds 
in addition  certain mortgage or other loan defaults could result in a default under our corporate debt  including our amended revolving credit facility  or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for additional information on clift  see the risk factor beginning because land underlying sanderson is subject to a year ground lease below 

table of contents our amended revolving credit facility and other debt instruments contain financial and other covenants that may limit our ability to borrow and restrict our operations  and if we fail to comply with such covenants  such failure could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments 
our amended revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio 
our ability to borrow under our amended revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with this financial and other covenants  and our ability to comply with the covenants may be impacted by any deterioration in our operations brought on by the current economic downturn  potential further declines in our property values  and additional borrowings to maintain our liquidity and fund our capital and financing obligations 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our amended revolving credit facility and other agreements 
however  if our business deteriorates  we may breach one or more of our financial covenants in the future 
in the event we breach our financial covenants  we would be in default under the amended revolving credit facility and or certain other agreements  which could allow lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreements to become due and payable 
additionally  an acceleration event under one debt instrument could allow for acceleration under other debt instruments with cross acceleration provisions 
if this happens  there would be a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the amount available for borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility is contingent upon the borrowing base  which is calculated by reference to the appraised value and implied debt service coverage value of certain collateral properties securing the amended revolving credit facility 
as of december   the available borrowing base  before million of outstanding letters of credit posted against the amended revolving credit facility  was approximately million 
our ability to borrow under the amended revolving credit facility and the amount of cash that may need to be retained from such borrowings also depends on our ability to maintain the amended revolving credit facility s financial covenant 
if current economic conditions continue  however  this borrowing base may be significantly reduced in the future 
as a result  we cannot assure you of the future amount  if any  that will be available under our amended revolving credit facility 
in addition  the amended revolving credit facility  trust preferred securities  and convertible notes as defined below include limitations on our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain acquisitions 
these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
some of our other existing indebtedness contain limitations on our ability to incur additional debt on specific properties  as well as financial covenants relating to the performance of those properties 
if these covenants restrict us from engaging in activities that we believe would benefit those properties  our growth may be limited 
if we fail to comply with these covenants  we will need to obtain consents or waivers from compliance with these covenants  which may take time  cause us to incur additional expenses  or may require us to prepay the debt containing the restrictive covenants 
we have incurred substantial losses and have a significant net deficit  and due to the current negative economic environment  may continue to incur losses in the future 
we reported pre tax net losses of million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net losses primarily reflect losses in equity of unconsolidated joint ventures  impairment charges  which we do not expect to be recurring  and interest expense and depreciation and amortization charges  which we expect will continue to be significant 
further  stock compensation  a non cash expense  contributed to the net losses recorded during   and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability and generate net income for our stockholders in the near term or at all 
boutique hotels such as ours may be more susceptible to an economic downturn than other segments of the hospitality industry  which could result in declines in our average daily room rates or occupancy  or both 
the performance of the hospitality industry  and the boutique hotel segment in particular  has traditionally been closely linked with the general economy 
in the current economic downturn  boutique hotels such as ours may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues  as compared to hotels in other segments that have lower room rates  because our hotels generally target business and high end leisure travelers 
in this period of economic difficulties  business and high end leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel  choosing lower cost hotels or otherwise reducing the costs of their trips 
these changes could result in further declines in average daily room rates or occupancy  or both 
profitability also may be negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating hotels such as ours  when compared to other segments of the hospitality industry 

table of contents disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing for development of our properties and other purposes on reasonable terms 
us and global stock and credit markets are experiencing significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may prevent or negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or refinancing for development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms  which may cause us to suspend  abandon or delay development and other activities and otherwise negatively affect our business or our ability to refinance debt as it comes due 
for example  in  our echelon las vegas project was canceled after the applicable joint venture was unable to obtain necessary financing 
we have other potential development opportunities  which have not yet been financed  including mondrian palm springs 
the downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
boutique hotels are a highly competitive segment of the hospitality industry 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and operations will be adversely affected by declines in our average daily room rates or occupancy  or both 
we generally compete in the boutique hotel segment of the hospitality industry 
we believe that this segment is highly competitive 
competition within the boutique hotel segment is also likely to increase in the future 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
market perception that we no longer provide innovative property concepts and designs would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our business and operations 
all of our properties are located in areas with numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
in addition  new hotels may be constructed in the areas in which our properties are located  possibly without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
the resulting decrease in our revenues could adversely affect our business and operations 
our success depends on the value of our name  image and brands  and if the demand for our hotels and their features decreases or the value of our name  image or brands diminishes  our business and operations would be adversely affected 
our success depends  to a large extent  on our ability to shape and stimulate consumer tastes and demands by producing and maintaining innovative  attractive  and exciting properties and services  as well as our ability to remain competitive in the areas of design and quality 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard or that we will be able to anticipate and react to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner 
furthermore  a high media profile is an integral part of our ability to shape and stimulate demand for our hotels with our target customers 
a key aspect of our marketing strategy is to focus on attracting media coverage 
if we fail to attract that media coverage  we may need to substantially increase our advertising and marketing costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  other types of marketing tools  such as traditional advertising and marketing  may not be successful in attracting our target customers 
our business would be adversely affected if our public image  reputation or brand were to be diminished  including as a result of any failure to remain competitive in the areas of design  quality and service 
if we do not maintain our hotel properties at a high level  which necessitates  from time to time  capital expenditures and the replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  or the owners of the hotels that we manage fail to develop or maintain the properties at standards worthy of the morgans hotel group brand  the value of our name  image or brands would be diminished and our business and operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business 
we believe that our trademarks are critical to our success 
we rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
the success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use our trademarks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time  we apply to have certain trademarks registered 
there is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted 
we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others 
the unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance  competitive advantages or goodwill  which could adversely affect our business 
we may have disputes with  or be sued by  third parties for infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights  which could have a negative impact on our business 
other parties may assert trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights that have a negative impact on our business 
we cannot assure you that others will not seek to block our use of certain marks or seek monetary damages or other remedies for the prior use of our brand names or other intellectual property or the sale of our products or services as a violation of their trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights 
defending any claims  even claims without merit  could divert our management s attention  be time consuming  result in costly settlements  litigation or restrictions on our business and damage our reputation 
in addition  there may be prior registrations or use of trademarks in the united states or foreign countries for similar or competing marks or other proprietary rights of which we are not aware 
in all such countries it may be possible for any third party owner of a national trademark registration or other proprietary right to enjoin or limit our expansion into those countries or to seek damages for our use of such intellectual property in such countries 
in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property or redesign or rename our products or operations to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
securing registrations does not fully insulate us against intellectual property claims  as another party may have rights superior to our registration or our registration may be vulnerable to attack on various grounds 
our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of cities and  accordingly  we could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn in these cities or a disaster  such as a hurricane or earthquake 
the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic  business and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies 
morgans  royalton and hudson  located in manhattan  represented approximately of our total guest rooms for all the hotels we manage and approximately million  or  of our consolidated hotel revenues for the year ended december  currently  the manhattan hotel market is experiencing a significant decline related to the global economic downturn 
a terrorist attack or similar disaster would also cause a decline in the manhattan hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates  the financial performance of our new york hotels and our overall results of operations 
in addition  the significant expansion of the hard rock hotel casino in las vegas and the opening of mondrian south beach  our third hotel in miami  have increased our geographic concentration in las vegas and miami  respectively  making us susceptible to economic slowdowns and other factors in those markets  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  certain of our hotels are located in markets that are more susceptible to natural disasters than others  which could adversely affect those hotels  the local economies  or both 
specifically  the miami area  where delano south beach  shore club and mondrian south beach are located  is susceptible to hurricanes and california  where mondrian los angeles and clift are located  is susceptible to earthquakes 
a variety of factors affecting the local markets in which our hotels operate  including such natural disasters  could have a material adverse affect on our business and operations 
the hard rock hotel casino in las vegas is subject to extensive state and local regulation  and licensing and gaming authorities in nevada have significant control over our gaming operations at the hard rock hotel casino in las vegas and gaming license considerations could constrain the manner in which we conduct our business 
our ability to operate the casino at the hard rock hotel casino in las vegas is contingent upon our maintenance of all regulatory licenses  permits  approvals  registrations  findings of suitability  orders and authorizations 
the laws  regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses  permits and other approvals generally relate to the responsibility  financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations  as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations 
the scope of the approvals required to open and operate a facility is extensive 
failure to obtain or maintain any of the required gaming approvals and licenses could impair our future financial position and results of operations 
the nevada gaming commission may  in its discretion  require the holder of any securities we issue to file applications  be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that such ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the state of nevada 
nevada regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information  to limit  condition  suspend or revoke a registration  gaming license or related approval and to approve changes in our operations 
such authorities may levy substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations 
the suspension or revocation of any license that may be granted to us or the levy of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  compliance costs associated with gaming laws  regulations and licenses are significant 
any change in the laws  regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming license could require us to make substantial expenditures or could otherwise negatively affect our gaming operations 
the threat of terrorism has adversely affected the hospitality industry generally and these adverse effects may continue or worsen 
the threat of terrorism has caused  and may in the future cause  a significant decrease in hotel occupancy and average daily rate  or adr  due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety 
hotels in major metropolitan areas  such as new york and london that represented approximately of our total guest rooms for all the hotels we manage at december   may be adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel  particularly transient business travel  which includes the corporate and premium business segments that generally pay the highest average room rates 
the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and  accordingly  the performance of our business and our operations 

table of contents we are exposed to the risks of a global market  which could hinder our ability to maintain and expand our international operations 
we have properties in the united states  the united kingdom and mexico and may expand to other international markets 
the success and profitability of any future international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control  such as global economic conditions  such as the current economic downturn  political or economic instability  changes in governmental regulation  trade restrictions  foreign currency controls  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries  work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions  taxes  payments terms  and seasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world 
furthermore  changes in policies and or laws of the united states or foreign governments resulting in  among other things  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations or the expropriation of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international operations 
any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign trade could adversely affect our business relationships and gross profit 
in addition  we may be restricted in moving or repatriating funds attributable to our international properties without the approval of foreign governmental authorities or courts 
for example  because of our historical net losses in our united kingdom operations  funds repatriated from the united kingdom may be considered a return of capital and may require court approval 
these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
establishing operations in any foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above  as well as risks specific to the particular country or region 
we may not be able to maintain and expand our international operations successfully  and as a result  our business operations could be adversely affected 
the hotel business is capital intensive and requires capital improvements to remain competitive  the failure to timely fund such capital improvements  the rising cost of such improvements and increasing operating expenses could negatively impact our ability to compete  reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance 
our hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive  including replacement  from time to time  of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
to compete effectively  we will need to make capital expenditures to maintain our innovative property concepts and designs 
in addition  we will need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million for capital improvements and renovations to our hotels 
if we are not able to fund capital improvements solely from cash provided from our operating activities  we will need to access debt or equity capital  which may not be available  particularly in the current financial markets 
if we cannot access debt or equity capital  we may need to postpone or cancel such capital improvements  which could harm our ability to remain competitive 
in addition  renovations and other capital improvements to our hotels may be expensive and may require us to close all or a portion of the hotels to customers during such renovations  affecting occupancy and average daily rate 
these capital improvements may give rise to the following additional risks  among others construction cost overruns and delays  exposure under completion and related guarantees  uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun  disruption in service and room availability causing reduced demand  occupancy and rates  and possible environmental problems 

table of contents as a result  capital improvement projects may increase our expenses and reduce our cash flows and our revenues 
if capital expenditures exceed our expectations  this excess would have an adverse effect on our available cash 
in addition  our amended revolving credit facility prohibits capital expenditures with respect to any hotels owned by us or our subsidiaries  other than maintenance capital expenditures for any hotel not exceeding of the annual gross revenues of such hotel and certain other exceptions 
if we are unable to make the capital improvements necessary to attract customers and grow our business within the limits imposed by the amended revolving credit facility  our properties may not remain competitive 
we have high fixed costs  including property taxes and insurance costs  which we may be unable to adjust in a timely manner in response to a reduction in revenues 
in addition  our property taxes have increased in recent years and we expect those increases to continue 
the costs associated with owning and operating hotels are significant  some of which may not be altered in a timely manner in response to changes in demand for services  failure to adjust our expenses may adversely affect our business and operations 
for example  pursuant to the terms of our agreements with the labor unions for our new york city and san francisco hotels  we may not unilaterally reduce the wages of the employees subject to these agreements  and are restricted in the manner in which we may layoff and or alter the schedule of employees 
property taxes and insurance costs are a significant part of our operating expenses 
in recent years  our real property taxes have increased and we expect those increases to continue 
our real property taxes may increase as property tax rates change and as the values of properties are assessed and reassessed by taxing authorities 
in addition  our real property tax rates will increase as property tax abatements expire 
for example  the property tax abatement applicable to hudson began phasing out over a five year period beginning in our real estate taxes do not depend on our revenues  and generally we could not reduce them other than by disposing of our real estate assets 
insurance premiums for the hospitality industry have increased significantly in recent years  and continued escalation may result in our inability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable premium rates 
a continuation of this trend would appreciably increase the operating expenses of our hotels 
if we do not obtain adequate insurance  to the extent that any of the events not covered by an insurance policy materialize  our financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in the future  our properties may be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility costs  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses  as well as reductions in our revenues due to the current global economic downturn  which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance 
although we have instituted measures to actively manage costs by implementing certain cost cutting contingency plans at each of our properties and cost reduction plans at our corporate office  we may not be successful in managing such cost reductions effectively to mitigate reductions in revenues without significantly impacting the customer experience 
if our revenue continues to decline  as it did in  and we are unable to reduce our expenses in a timely manner  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our strategy to acquire and develop or redevelop hotels creates timing  financing  operational and other risks that may adversely affect our business and operations 
we intend to acquire and develop  or redevelop through expansion  hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise 
acquisitions  development or redevelopment projects of hotel properties require significant capital expenditures  especially since these properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the project s completion 
we generally are not able to fund acquisitions and development or redevelopment projects solely from cash provided from our operating activities 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and development or redevelopment 
for example  we are currently developing a property in new york mondrian soho 
additionally  we have other potential development opportunities  which have not yet been financed  including mondrian palm springs 
given the current state of the credit markets  however  we or the joint ventures may not be able to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all 
if adequate project financing is not obtained  we or the joint ventures may seek additional investors to raise capital  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
our inability to complete a project or complete a project on time or within budget may adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 

table of contents neither our charter nor our bylaws limits the amount of debt that we can incur 
however  given the current economic environment  no assurances can be made that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms 
we may not be able to successfully compete for desirable hotel management  development  acquisition or investment opportunities 
we may not be successful in identifying or completing hotel projects that are consistent with our strategy 
we compete with hotel operating companies  institutional pension funds  private equity investors  real estate investment trusts  owner operators of hotels and others who are engaged in hotel operating or real estate investment activities for the operation  development  and acquisition of hotels 
in addition  competition for suitable hotel management  development  investment and acquisition opportunities is intense and may increase in the future 
some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do  and as such  will be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage 
these competitors may limit the number of suitable hotel management  development  investment and acquisition opportunities for us by driving up the price we must pay for such opportunities 
in addition  our potential hotel management or development projects or acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources  be willing to pay more  have a more compatible operating philosophy  or better relationships with hotel franchisors  sellers or lenders 
furthermore  the terms of our management agreements are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors  among other things 
we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations  renew agreements  or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 
even if we are able to successfully identify and acquire other hotel management or development projects  acquisitions or investments  they may not yield the returns we expect and  if financed using our equity capital  may be dilutive 
we also may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential hotel management or development projects or acquisitions  including ones that we or others are subsequently unable to complete 
for example  although we entered into an agreement to manage a hotel to be developed in dubai  the owner has not yet begun development and may never be able to do so 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring a hotel management agreement or development project or acquired property up to the standards established for its intended market position or to re develop it as a morgans hotel group brand hotel or the costs to integrate it with our existing operations 
although we anticipate that the owners of the hotels that we manage in san juan  puerto rico and playa del carmen  mexico will re develop the hotels into morgans hotel group branded properties in the future  we can provide no assurances that such re branding will be completed  successful or timely 
significant costs of hotel development projects or acquisitions could materially impact our operating results  including costs of uncompleted hotel development projects or acquisitions as they would generally be expensed in the time period during which they are incurred 
integration of new hotels may be difficult and may adversely affect our business and operations 
the success of any hotel management or development project or acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating new hotels with our existing operations 
for instance  we may manage  develop or acquire new hotels in geographic areas in which our management may have little or no operating experience and in which potential customers may not be familiar with our existing hotels  name  image or brands 
these hotels may attract fewer customers than our existing hotels  while at the same time  we may incur substantial additional costs with these new hotel properties 
as a result  the results of operations at new hotel properties may be inferior to those of our existing hotels 
until recently  none of our individual hotel brands were used for more than one hotel 
extension of our brands may jeopardize what we believe are the distinct reputations of our existing properties 
unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand at a new hotel property  therefore  could adversely affect our business 
our success in realizing anticipated benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of the new hotel 
this integration is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining new hotel properties with our existing operations include  among others coordinating sales  distribution and marketing functions  integrating information systems  
table of contents preserving the important licensing  distribution  marketing  customer  labor  and other relationships of a new hotel  costs relating to the opening  operation and promotion of new hotel properties that are substantially greater than those incurred in other geographic areas  and converting hotels to our brand 
we may not accomplish the integration of new hotels smoothly or successfully 
the diversion of the attention of our management from our existing operations to integration efforts and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from the addition of the new hotel and could adversely affect our business and operations 
the use of joint ventures or other entities  over which we may not have full control  for hotel development projects or acquisitions could prevent us from achieving our objectives 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire  develop or redevelop hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties  acquiring non controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  joint venture or other entity 
for example  we currently are party to a joint venture to develop a mondrian hotel in new york s soho neighborhood 
as of december   we also owned our st martins lane and sanderson hotels in london and our mondrian hotel in miami through joint ventures  our ames hotel in boston through a joint venture in which our interest was approximately  and the hard rock through a joint venture of which our interest was 
our interest in the hard rock joint venture is based on cash contributions  as of december   after applying a weighting of x to the dljmb parties contributions in excess of million  which was the last agreed weighting for capital contributions beyond the amount initially committed by our joint venture partner 
some of these additional contributions made by the dljmb parties may ultimately receive a greater weighting based on an appraisal process included in the joint venture agreement or as otherwise agreed by the parties  which would further dilute our ownership interest 
to the extent we own properties through joint ventures or other entities  we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property  joint venture or other entity 
investments in joint ventures or other entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
likewise  partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 
such investments may also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions if neither we nor our partner have full control over the joint venture or other entity 
disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and effort on our business 
consequently  actions by  or disputes with  our partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
in addition  we may  certain circumstances  be liable for the actions of our partners 
we have recently invested  and may continue to invest in the future  in select properties which have residential components  and this strategy may not yield the returns we expect and  may result in disruptions to our business or strain management resources 
as part of our growth strategy  we may seek to leverage awareness of our hotel brands by acquiring  developing and or managing non hotel properties  such as condominium developments and other residential projects  including condominiums or apartments 
we may invest in these opportunities solely or with joint venture partners 
for example  in august  together with a joint venture partner  we acquired an apartment building in the south beach area of miami  florida  which we renovated and converted into a hotel and condominium project and re branded as mondrian south beach 
this strategy  however  may expose us to additional risks  including the following we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development or re development costs and or lower than expected sales  
table of contents the downturn in market conditions for residences  which has partially been the result of the reduction in credit availability and the worsening of pricing terms  has affected and may continue to affect our ability to sell residential units at a profit or at the price levels originally anticipated  local residential real estate market conditions  such as the current oversupply and reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  cost overruns  including development or re development costs that exceed our original estimates  could make completion of the project uneconomical  land  insurance and development or re development costs continue to increase and may continue to increase in the future and we may be unable to attract rents  or sales prices that compensate for these increases in costs  development or re development of condominium properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the project s completion and the sale of a significant number of condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such condominium units are sold  failure to achieve expected occupancy and or rent levels at residential apartment properties within the projected time frame  if at all  and we may abandon development or re development opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities 
overall project costs may significantly exceed the costs that were estimated when the project was originally undertaken  which will result in reduced returns  or even losses  from our investment 
we may be involved in disputes  from time to time  with the owners of the hotels that we manage 
the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage hotels that are not wholly owned by us may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements 
such disagreements may be more likely as hotel returns are depressed as a result of current economic conditions 
to the extent that such conflicts arise  we seek to resolve them by negotiation with the relevant parties 
in the event that such resolution cannot be achieved  litigation may result in damages or other remedies against us 
such remedies could include termination of the right to manage the relevant property 
we may be terminated pursuant to the terms of certain hotel management agreements if we do not achieve established performance criteria 
certain of our management agreements allow the hotel owner to replace us if certain financial or performance criteria are not met and in certain cases  upon a sale of the property 
our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to  among other things  the risks described in this section 
for instance  beginning months following completion of the expansion of the hard rock  our hard rock management agreement may be terminated if the hard rock fails to achieve an ebitda hurdle  as defined in the management agreement 
there can be no assurances that we will satisfy this or other performance tests in our management agreements  many of which may be beyond our control  or that our management agreements will not be subject to early termination 
several of our hotels are also subject to substantial mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt and our management agreements may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure 
the lender for the scottsdale mortgage has terminated the management agreement with respect to that property 
in addition  in march  the lender for the shore club mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against the property 
we are continuing to operate the hotel during foreclosure proceedings  but we are uncertain whether we will continue to manage the property once foreclosure proceedings are complete 
our operating results would be adversely affected if we could not maintain existing management agreements or obtain new agreements on as favorable terms as the existing agreements 

table of contents our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates 
we use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks  but no hedging strategy can protect us completely 
when interest rates change  we may be required to record a gain or loss on those derivatives that we currently hold 
our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps  caps and floors and options to purchase these items 
we currently use interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risks related to our variable rate indebtedness  however  our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time and may differ from our currently anticipated hedging strategy 
there can be no assurance that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses  and such losses could harm our results of operations  financial condition and business prospects 
our operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks  and we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operating results 
our operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating results 
for example  all else being equal  a weaker us dollar will promote international tourism in our domestic markets 
as foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  it becomes less expensive  in terms of those appreciating foreign currencies  to pay for our us hotel services 
conversely  all else being equal  an appreciating us dollar could affect demand for our us hotel services 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operations 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  it may have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we are subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  and the applicable sec rules and regulations that require our management to conduct an annual assessment and to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must issue an attestation report addressing the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet all of the standards required by sox  failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 
we cannot be certain as to our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox 
if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  including the sec or financial industry regulatory authority 
in addition  should we identify a material weakness  there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in a timely manner in future periods 
moreover  if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting  which may have an a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we depend on our senior management for the future success of our business  and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies  or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
our future success and our ability to manage future growth depend  in large part  upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team which has substantial experience in the hospitality industry and which exercises substantial influence over our operational  financing  acquisition and disposition activity 
it could be difficult for us to find replacements for our senior management  as competition for such personnel is intense 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and implement our growth strategies 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets  which could reduce the market value of our securities 

table of contents we depend on jeffrey chodorow for the management of many of our restaurants and bars 
as of december   the restaurants in morgans  delano south beach  mondrian los angeles  clift  mondrian south beach  sanderson and st martins lane as well as the bars in delano south beach  sanderson and st martins lane were owned and managed through several joint venture operations with restaurateur jeffrey chodorow pursuant to a master agreement between our subsidiaries and chodorow ventures llc 
if any of the risks outlined below materialize  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the joint ventures involve risks not otherwise present in our business  including the risk that mr 
chodorow or chodorow ventures llc has economic or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals and that he may not take  or may veto  actions which may be in our best interests  the risk that a joint venture entity or chodorow ventures llc may default on its obligations under the agreement or the leases with our hotels  or not renew those leases when they expire  and therefore we may not continue to receive its services  the risk that disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business  the risk that we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers  and the risk that chodorow ventures llc may become bankrupt and will be unable to continue to provide services to us 
because land underlying sanderson is subject to a year ground lease  clift is leased pursuant to a year lease and a portion of hudson is the lease of a condominium interest  we are subject to the risk that these leases could be terminated and could cause us to lose the ability to operate these hotels 
our rights to use the land underlying sanderson in london are based upon our interest under a year ground lease 
our rights to operate clift in san francisco are based upon our interest under a year lease 
in addition  a portion of hudson in new york is a condominium interest that is leased to us 
pursuant to the terms of the leases for these hotels  we are required to pay all rent due and comply with all other lessee obligations under the leases 
any transfer  including a pledge  of our interest in a lease may require the consent of the applicable lessor and its lenders 
as a result  we may not be able to sell  assign  transfer or convey our lessee s interest in any hotel subject to a lease in the future absent consent of such third parties even if such transactions may be in the best interest of our stockholders 

table of contents the lessor may require us  at the expiration or termination of the lease to surrender or remove any improvements  alterations or additions to the land or hotel at our own expense 
the leases also generally require us to restore the premises following a casualty or taking and to apply in a specified manner any proceeds received in connection therewith 
we may have to restore the premises if a material casualty  such as a fire or an act of god  occurs  the cost of which may exceed any available insurance proceeds 
the termination of any of these leases could cause us to lose the ability to continue operating these hotels  which would materially affect our business and results of operations 
due to the amount of rent stated in the lease  which will increase periodically  and the economic environment in which the hotel operates  we are not operating clift at a profit and do not know when we will be able to operate clift profitably 
morgans group has funded cash shortfalls sustained at clift in order to make rent payments from time to time  but  on march   our subsidiary that leases clift did not make the scheduled monthly rent payment 
we are in discussions with the landlord to restructure the lease arrangements  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in restructuring the lease or in continuing to operate clift 
the lease provides that the landlord may terminate the lease upon a default in the payment of rent and may assert a claim for damages or a substantial termination fee upon termination 
however  under the lease  the landlord s recourse is limited to the lessee  which has no substantial assets other than its leasehold interest in clift 
we are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements  certain of which limit our activities through restrictive covenants or consent rights 
violation of those covenants or failure to receive consents could lead to termination of those contracts or operating agreements 
we are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements  many of which are integral to our business operations 
certain of those contracts and operating agreements  including our joint venture agreements  generally require that we obtain the consent of the other party or parties before taking certain actions and or contain restrictive covenants that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants or failure to obtain consents could provide the beneficiaries of those covenants or consents with the right to terminate the relevant contract or operating agreement or seek damages against us 
if those claims relate to agreements that are integral to our operations  any termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents risks related to the hospitality industry a number of factors  many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control  could affect our business  including those described elsewhere in this section as well as the following increased competition from new supply or existing hotel properties in our markets  which would likely adversely affect occupancy and revenues at our hotels  dependence on business  commercial and leisure travelers and tourism  dependence on group and meeting conference business  increases in energy costs  airline strikes or other factors that may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists  changes in laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  and risks generally associated with the ownership of hotel properties and real estate 
these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature 
this seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
our revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters 
our quarterly earnings may also be adversely affected by factors outside our control  including weather conditions and poor economic conditions  such as the current economic downturn 
as a result  we may have to enter into short term borrowings in certain quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues 
the industries in which we operate are heavily regulated and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in an adverse effect on our business 
any failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in an adverse effect on our business 
our various properties are subject to numerous laws  including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages  including alcohol 
we are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees in such areas as minimum wage and maximum working hours  overtime  working conditions  hiring and firing employees and work permits 
also  our ability to remodel  refurbish or add to our existing properties may be dependent upon our obtaining necessary building permits from local authorities 
the failure to obtain any of these permits could adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and net income through capital improvements of our properties 
in addition  we are subject to the numerous rules and regulations relating to state and federal taxation 
compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant management attention 
any failure to comply with all such rules and regulations could subject us to fines or audits by the applicable taxation authority 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of the hard rock hotel casino  the casino operations at that property are subject to gaming industry regulations 
the gaming industry is highly regulated  and the casino must maintain its licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue operations 
the casino is subject to extensive regulation under the laws  rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
these laws  rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility  financial stability and character of the owners  managers  and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations 
violations of laws could result in  among other things  disciplinary action 
the illiquidity of real estate investments and the lack of alternative uses of hotel properties could significantly limit our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more of our properties in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

table of contents although we evaluate alternative uses throughout our portfolio  including residential conversion and other opportunities  hotel properties may not readily be converted to alternative uses 
the conversion of a hotel to alternative uses would also generally require substantial capital expenditures and may not provide a more profitable return than the use of the hotel property prior to that conversion 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we may not have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements and as a result our ability to sell the property would be limited 
in acquiring a hotel  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions on us 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations 
uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are responsible for insuring our hotel properties as well as obtaining the appropriate insurance coverage to reasonably protect our interests in the ordinary course of business 
additionally  each of our leases and loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance be maintained on each of our hotel properties  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes and floods or terrorist acts  which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable  or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations  such as large deductibles or co payments 
we will use our discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits  deductibility provisions of insurance and the appropriateness of self insuring  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
uninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to our hotels or to persons at our hotels 
claims  whether or not they have merit  could harm the reputation of a hotel or cause us to incur expenses to the extent of insurance deductibles or losses in excess of policy limitations  which could harm our results of operations 
in the event of a catastrophic loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
in the event of a significant loss  our deductible may be high and we may be required to pay for all such repairs and  as a consequence  it could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property 
since september   it has generally become more difficult and expensive to obtain property and casualty insurance  including coverage for terrorism 
when our current insurance policies expire  we may encounter difficulty in obtaining or renewing property or casualty insurance on our properties at the same levels of coverage and under similar terms 
such insurance may be more limited and for some catastrophic risks eg  earthquake  hurricane  flood and terrorism may not be generally available at current levels 
even if we are able to renew our policies or to obtain new policies at levels and with limitations consistent with our current policies  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such insurance at premium rates that are commercially reasonable 
if we were unable to obtain adequate insurance on our properties for certain risks  it could cause us to be in default under specific covenants on certain of our indebtedness or other contractual commitments that require us to maintain adequate insurance on our properties to protect against the risk of loss 
if this were to occur  or if we were unable to obtain adequate insurance and our properties experienced damage which would otherwise have been covered by insurance  it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and the operations of our properties 
in addition  insurance coverage for our hotel properties and for casualty losses does not customarily cover damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages 
as a result  any claims or legal proceedings  or settlement of any such claims or legal proceedings that result in damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages may not be covered by our insurance 
if these types of damages are substantial  our financial resources may be adversely affected 

table of contents environmental and other governmental laws and regulations could increase our compliance costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our hotel properties are subject to various federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  fire and safety and access and use by disabled persons 
under these laws  courts and government agencies have the authority to require us  if we are the owner of a contaminated property  to clean up the property  even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination 
these laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated 
in addition to the costs of clean up  environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and  therefore  an owner s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property 
under such environmental laws  courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility  such as a landfill or an incinerator  to pay for the clean up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment 
furthermore  various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination 
for instance  a person exposed to asbestos while staying in or working at a hotel may seek to recover damages for injuries suffered 
additionally  some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities 
for example  some laws require a business using chemicals such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used 
we could be responsible for the types of costs discussed above 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
future laws or regulations may impose material environmental liabilities on us  or the current environmental condition of our hotel properties may be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotels such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
our hotel properties are also subject to the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada 
under the ada  all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada s requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in the united states government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages 
if we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels  whether to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  we are required to operate our hotel properties and laundry facilities in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and become applicable to our properties 
our hotels may be faced with labor disputes or  upon expiration of a collective bargaining agreement  a strike  which would adversely affect the operation of our hotels 
we rely heavily on our employees providing high quality personal service at our hotels and any labor dispute or stoppage caused by poor relations with a labor union or the hotels employees could adversely affect our ability to provide those services  which could reduce occupancy and room revenue  tarnish our reputation and hurt our results of operations 
most of our employees who work at morgans  royalton  hudson and clift are members of local labor unions 
our relationship with our employees or the union could deteriorate due to disputes relating to  among other things  wage or benefit levels or management responses to various economic and industry conditions 
the collective bargaining agreement governing the terms of employment for employees working in our new york city hotels will not expire until june  the collective bargaining agreements with the unions representing the clift employees are either set to expire in or expired in or  but are subject to temporary extensions while new labor agreements are negotiated 

table of contents risks related to our organization and corporate structure morgans hotel group co

morgans hotel group co 
is a holding company and we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
we do not have  apart from our ownership of morgans group and a non equity voting interest in hard rock hotel holdings  llc  any independent operations 
as a result and although we have no current plan to do so  we would rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from morgans group and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock 
we also rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from morgans group and our other subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations  including our obligations in respect of the trust preferred notes 
the ability of morgans group and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on morgans group s operating results 
in addition  because morgans hotel group co 
is a holding company  claims of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations whether or not for borrowed money of our subsidiaries 
therefore  in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full 
substantially all of our businesses are held through our direct subsidiary  morgans group 
other than with respect to  membership units held by affiliates of northstar and ltip units convertible into membership units issued as part of our employee compensation plans  we own all of the outstanding membership units of morgans group 
we may  in connection with acquisitions or otherwise  issue additional membership units of morgans group in the future 
such issuances would reduce our ownership of morgans group 
because our stockholders do not directly own morgans group units  they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other corporate level activities of morgans group 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could delay  deter or prevent a change in control and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors or changes in the composition of our board of directors  which could result in the entrenchment of current management 
these provisions include a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents  a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called by the board of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the bylaws  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and additional shares of our common stock 
we are also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquires such status unless certain board of directors or stockholder approvals are obtained 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors adopted and recently amended and restated a stockholder rights plan which may deter certain takeover tactics 
see item transactions and developments stockholder protection rights agreement 

table of contents we may experience conflicts of interest with certain of our directors and officers and significant stockholders as a result of their tax positions 
mr 
hamamoto  our chairman of the board  and mr 
marc gordon  our president and a member of the board  may suffer adverse tax consequences upon our sale of certain properties and may therefore have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of a particular property s sale 
messrs 
hamamoto and gordon may therefore influence us to not sell certain properties  even if such sale might be financially advantageous to our stockholders  or to enter into tax deferred exchanges with the proceeds of such sales when such a reinvestment might not otherwise be in our best interest  as they may wish to avoid realization of their share of the built in gains in those properties 
in addition  at the completion of our ipo  an affiliate of northstar guaranteed approximately million of the indebtedness of subsidiaries of morgans group and messrs 
hamamoto and gordon agreed to reimburse this guarantor for up to million and million of its guarantee obligation  respectively 
these guarantees and reimbursement undertakings were provided so that messrs 
hamamoto and gordon did not realize taxable capital gains in connection with the formation and structuring transactions undertaken in connection with our ipo in the amount that each has agreed to reimburse 
if our current debt were to be repaid  restructured or refinanced  messrs 
hamamoto and gordon would be adversely affected unless similar reimbursement or guarantees were put in place with respect to the new or existing debt of the morgans group subsidiaries 
the investors  who own a substantial number of warrants to purchase our common stock  may have interests that are not aligned with yours and will have substantial influence over the vote on key matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   the investors have  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in connection with the yucaipa investment  which does not include the  contingent warrants that will only become exercisable if we and an affiliate of the investors are successful in raising a private equity fund pursuant to the terms of a fund formation agreement entered into between an affiliate of the investors and us 
until october   the investors have certain rights to purchase their pro rata share of any equity or debt securities offered or sold by us 
in addition  the investors have consent rights over certain transactions for so long as they collectively own or have the right to purchase through exercise of the warrants  shares of our common stock  including subject to certain exceptions and limitations the sale of all or substantially all of our assets to a third party  the acquisition including by merger  consolidation or other business combination by us of a third party where the equity investment by us is million or greater  our acquisition by a third party  or any change in the size of our board of directors to a number below or above for so long the investors collectively own or have the right to purchase through exercise of the warrants  shares of our common stock  we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause our board of directors to nominate and recommend to our stockholders the election of a person nominated by the investors as a director of the company and to use our reasonable best efforts to ensure that the investors nominee is elected to our board of directors at each such meeting 
accordingly  the investors have substantial control over our business and can decide the outcome of key corporate decisions 
the interests of the investors may differ from the interests of our other stockholders  and they may cause us to take or not take certain actions with which you may disagree 
third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership  and we may have more difficulty raising equity or debt financing due to the investors significant ownership and ability to influence certain decisions 

table of contents payment of dividends on our series a preferred securities and any redemptions of warrants may negatively impact our cash flow and the value of our common stock 
on october  we issued  shares of series a preferred securities to the investors 
the holders of such series a preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash dividends  payable in arrears on every three month anniversary following the original date of issuance if such dividends are declared by the board of directors or an authorized committee thereof  at a rate of per year for the first five years  per year for years six and seven  and per year thereafter 
in addition  should the investors nominee fail to be elected to our board of directors  the dividend rate would increase by during any time that the investors nominee is not a director 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments  and as of december   have not declared any dividends 
the accrual of these dividends may dampen the value of our common stock 
in addition  the company has the option to redeem any or all of the series a preferred securities at any time 
while we do not anticipate redeeming any or all of the series a preferred securities in the near term  we may want to redeem them in the future prior to the escalation in dividend rate to in our working capital and liquidity reserves may not be adequate to cover these redemption payments should we elect to redeem these securities  which would place pressure on us to find outside sources of financing that may or may not be available 
in addition  the payment of these dividends  by reducing our ability to use capital for other business and operational needs  may limit our ability to grow and compete 
in addition  we may be required to redeem a portion of the warrants issued to the investors to the extent necessary to facilitate compliance with gaming approval requirements 
if we were unable to fund the redemption from available cash resources  we would need to find an alternative source of financing to do so 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise such funds on favorable terms or at all 
our basis in the hotels contributed to us is generally substantially less than their fair market value which will decrease the amount of our depreciation deductions and increase the amount of recognized gain upon sale 
some of the hotels which were part of our formation and structuring transactions were contributed to us in tax free transactions 
accordingly  our tax basis in the assets contributed was not adjusted in connection with our ipo and is generally substantially less than the fair market value of the contributed hotels as of the date of our ipo 
we also intend to generally use the traditional method for making allocations under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended  as opposed to the curative or remedial method for making such allocations 
consequently  i our depreciation deductions with respect to our hotels will likely be substantially less than the depreciation deductions that would have been available to us had our tax basis been equal to the fair market value of the hotels as of the date of our ipo  ii we may recognize gain upon the sale of an asset that is attributable to appreciation in the value of the asset that accrued prior to the date of our ipo  and iii we may utilize available net operating losses against the potential gain from the sale of an asset 
non us holders owning more than of our common stock may be subject to united states federal income tax on gain recognized on the disposition of our common stock 
because of our significant united states real estate holdings  we believe that we are a united states real property holding corporation as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
as a result  any non us holder as defined under material non us federal income tax considerations for non us holders will be subject to united states federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if such non us holder has held  directly or indirectly  of our common stock at any time during the five year period ending on the date of the disposition and such non us holder is not eligible for any treaty exemption 
changes in market conditions or sales of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock depends on various financial and market conditions  which may change from time to time and which are outside of our control 
since late  us and global financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption  including extreme volatility in securities prices  which has adversely affected the price of our common stock 

table of contents sales of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  also could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition to the possibility that we may sell shares of our common stock in a public offering at any time  we also may issue shares of common stock in connection with the warrants we issued to the investors and the fund manager in the yucaipa investment  our senior subordinated convertible notes the convertible notes due in  grants of restricted stock or long term incentive plan units or upon exercise of stock options that we grant to our directors  officers and employees 
all of these shares may be available for sale in the public markets from time to time 
as of december   there were  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants we issued to the investors  and up to  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise to the contingent warrants we issued to the fund manager in the yucaipa investment  at exercise prices of per share 
the stock price at december  was  shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes assuming a conversion rate corresponding to the maximum conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the convertible notes   shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options  of which options to purchase  shares were exercisable  at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
as of december   all of these options were underwater   restricted stock units and  ltip units outstanding exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock   restricted stock units and  ltip units outstanding and subject to vesting requirements for a total of  shares of our common stock  and  shares of our common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans 
most of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for resale in the public market and certain holders of our shares have the right to require us to file a registration statement for purposes of registering their shares for resale 
a significant portion of these shares is held by a small number of stockholders 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline  which may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we are unable to predict the effect that sales of our common stock may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
transactions relating to our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we have entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers  which we refer to as the counterparties 
pursuant to the convertible note hedge  we have purchased from the counterparties a call option on our common stock  and pursuant to the warrant transaction  we have sold to the counterparties a warrant for the purchase of shares of our common stock 
the warrant has an exercise price that is higher than the closing price of our common stock on the date of the pricing of the convertible notes 
together  the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are expected to provide us with some protection against increases in our stock price over the conversion price per share and  accordingly  reduce our exposure to potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
we used an aggregate of approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering of the convertible notes to fund the net cost of these hedging transactions 
in connection with these transactions  the counterparties to these transactions entered into various over the counter derivative transactions or purchased or sold our common stock in secondary market transactions at or about the time of the pricing of the convertible notes  and may enter into  or may unwind  various over the counter derivatives or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the convertible notes  including during any conversion reference period with respect to a conversion of convertible notes 

table of contents these activities may have the effect of increasing  or preventing a decline in  the market price of our common stock 
in addition  any hedging transactions by the counterparties following the pricing of the convertible notes  including during any conversion reference period  may have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or other instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
in particular  such hedging modifications may occur during a conversion reference period 
in addition  we intend to exercise our purchased call option whenever convertible notes are converted  although we are not required to do so 
in order to unwind any hedge positions with respect to our exercise of the purchased call option  the counterparties would expect to sell shares of common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to the common stock during the conversion reference period for the converted convertible notes 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on current market conditions and therefore cannot be ascertained at this time 
however  any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price has been and continues to be volatile 
our stock price has been extremely volatile recently  especially given current market conditions  and may continue to fluctuate as a result of various factors  such as general industry and economic conditions  such as the current global economic downturn  general stock market volatility unrelated to our operating performance  announcements relating to significant corporate transactions  fluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results  operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us  changes in government regulation or proposals relating thereto  and sales or the expectation of sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market 
the stock markets have  since late  experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
market volatility  as well as the global economic downturn  have adversely affected  and will likely continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock

overview we are a fully integrated hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels primarily in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states and europe 
over our year history  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our owned hotels  consisting of morgans  royalton and hudson in new york  delano south beach in miami  south beach  mondrian los angeles in los angeles  clift in san francisco  and mondrian scottsdale in scottsdale 
as of december   mondrian scottsdale was in foreclosure proceedings and the operations have been reclassified on our consolidated financial statements to hotel held for non sale disposition  our joint venture hotels  consisting of our london hotels sanderson and st martins lane  hard rock in las vegas  mondrian south beach and shore club in south beach  miami  and ames in boston  our non morgans hotel group branded hotels which we manage independently  consisting of the san juan water and beach club in isla verde  puerto rico and hotel las palapas in playa del carmen  mexico  our investments in hotels under construction  such as mondrian soho  and our investment in other proposed properties  our investment in certain joint venture food and beverage operations at our owned hotels and joint venture hotels  discussed further below  our management company subsidiary  mhg management company  and the rights and obligations contributed to morgans group in the formation and structuring transactions described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we consolidate the results of operations for all of our owned hotels and certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels  which are operated under joint ventures with restaurateur jeffrey chodorow 
we consolidate the food and beverage joint ventures as we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of these entities 
our partner s share of the results of operations of these food and beverage joint ventures are recorded as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at three of the joint venture hotels  sanderson  st martins lane and mondrian south beach 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 

table of contents as of december   we operated the following joint venture hotels under management agreements which expire as follows sanderson june with one year extension at our option  st martins lane june with one year extension at our option  shore club july  hard rock february with two year extensions  mondrian south beach august  and ames november in addition to the joint venture hotels  we also manage two non morgans hotel group branded hotels in which we did not have any ownership interest at december  in october  we began managing the san juan water and beach club in isla verde  puerto rico under a year management agreement 
in december  we began managing hotel las palapas in playa del carmen  mexico under a five year management agreement with one five year extension  which is automatic so long as we are not in default under the management agreement 
we have also signed an agreement to manage mondrian soho once development is complete 
we have signed management agreements to manage various other hotels that are in development  including a mondrian palm springs project  but we are unsure of the future of the development of these hotels as financing has not yet been obtained 
in march  the lender for the shore club mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against the property 
we are continuing to operate the hotel pursuant to the management agreement during foreclosure proceedings  but we are uncertain whether we will continue to manage the property once foreclosure proceedings are complete 
these management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
for instance  beginning months following completion of the expansion of the hard rock  our hard rock management agreement may be terminated if the hard rock fails to achieve an ebitda hurdle  as defined in the management agreement 
there can be no assurances that we will satisfy this or other performance tests in our management agreements  many of which may be beyond our control  or that our management agreements will not be subject to early termination 
several of our hotels are also subject to substantial mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt and our management agreements may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure 
factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  adr  and revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the operation of our hotels 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is earned by our restaurant joint ventures and is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
other hotel revenue 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  is principally driven by hotel occupancy 
revenues of hotel held for non sale disposition 
revenue of hotel held for non sale disposition includes room revenue  food and beverage revenue and other hotel revenues for mondrian scottsdale  which is in foreclosure proceedings as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
management fee related parties revenue and other income 
we earn fees under our management agreements 
these fees may include management fees as well as reimbursement for allocated chain services 
additionally  in we earned a branding fee related to the use of our delano brand in connection with sales by our joint venture partner in the delano dubai development project of condominium units 

table of contents fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
however  given the global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and the fourth quarter of was not as significant as in prior periods 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates and occupancy tend to fall when supply increases  unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing  and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services  costs to operate our management company  and costs associated with the ownership of our assets  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our restaurants and bars are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
operating expenses of hotel held for non sale disposition 
operating expenses of hotel held for non sale disposition includes rooms expenses  food and beverage expenses  other departmental expenses  hotel selling  general and administrative expenses  property taxes  insurance and other expenses for mondrian scottsdale  which is in foreclosure proceedings  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses  comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 

table of contents property taxes  insurance and other

corporate expenses  including stock compensation

depreciation expense of hotel held for non sale disposition 
total depreciation expense of hotel held for non sale disposition includes depreciation expense for mondrian scottsdale  which is in foreclosure proceedings  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
restructuring  development and disposal costs include costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives implemented in and  charges associated with disposals of assets as part of major renovation projects and the write off of abandoned development projects resulting primarily from events generally outside management s control such as the current tightness of the credit markets 
these items do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of our assets 
impairment loss on hotel held for non sale disposition 
when certain triggering events occur  we periodically review each asset for possible impairment 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset to estimate the fair value of the asset  taking into account the applicable assets expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the asset 
for the years ended december  and  management concluded that our investment in mondrian scottsdale was impaired 
impairment charges of million and million  respectively  are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and other items interest expense  net 
interest expense  net includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is presented net of interest income and interest capitalized 
interest expense of hotel held for non sale disposition 
interest expense of hotel held for non sale disposition includes interest on our non recourse mortgage and mezzanine debt at mondrian scottsdale 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our joint venture hotels and our investments in hotels under development 
further  we and our joint venture partners review our joint venture hotels for other than temporary declines in market value 
in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment taking into account expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
as such  included in our equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures is our portion of the respective joint ventures impairment charges of million for our investment in mondrian south beach and million on our investment in echelon las vegas 
as of december   management concluded that there is no impairment loss in the value of the unconsolidated joint ventures that is determined to be other than temporary 

table of contents impairment loss on development project 
when certain triggering events occur  we periodically review each asset for possible impairment

for the year ended december   management concluded that our investment in the property across the street from delano south beach was impaired 
an impairment charge of million was recognized and is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  other non operating income expenses include costs associated with financings  litigation and settlement costs and other items that relate to the financing and investing activities associated with our assets and not to the ongoing operating performance of our assets  both consolidated and unconsolidated  as well as the change in fair market value of our warrants issued in connection with the yucaipa transaction 
income tax benefit expense 
all of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the years ended december   and were computed using our calculated effective tax rate 
we also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest constitutes our third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits of the restaurant ventures at certain of our hotels as well as the percentage of membership units in morgans group  our operating company  owned by residual hotel interest llc  our former parent  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
dividends attributable to our outstanding preferred stock and the accretion of the fair value discount on the issuance of the preferred stock are reflected as adjustments to our net loss to arrive at net loss attributable to common stockholders  as discussed in notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies and certain labor such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant costs that are relatively fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 

table of contents recent trends and developments recent trends 
starting in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the weakened us and global economies have resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending 
as a result  lodging demand and revenues  which are primarily driven by growth in gdp  business investment and employment growth  weakened substantially during the year ended december   as compared to the lodging demand and revenues we experienced prior to the fourth quarter of we believe lodging demand and revenues will remain weak in  particularly in the first half of the year  although we do not expect to see the magnitude of declines we have experienced during the last five quarters 
recently  the rate of decline in the lodging sector has slowed and we are beginning to see indications of return in demand in key gateway markets  most notably in the form of increasing occupancy in those markets 
however  while the outlook for the us and global economies have somewhat improved  spending by businesses and consumers remains cautious  and we do not anticipate that lodging demand will improve significantly until global economic trends show more sustained and robust growth 
to help mitigate the effects of these trends  we are actively managing costs at each of our properties and our corporate office 
through our multi phased contingency plan  we reduced hotel operating expenses and corporate expenses during and we will continue to carefully monitor our costs with the objective of maintaining cost efficiencies realized in in and beyond 
we believe that these cost reduction plans have resulted and will continue to result in significant savings in future quarters and that our experienced management team and dedicated employees have allowed us to implement these cost cuts without significant impact to the overall quality of our guest experience 
in addition  as occupancy levels begin to rise in some of our markets  we are focusing on revenue enhancement by actively managing rates and availability 
as modest demand begins to return  as evidenced by the increase in occupancy  the ability to increase pricing will be a critical component in driving profitability 
through these challenging times  our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by maximizing revenue  increasing our market share and managing costs 
although the pace of new lodging supply in various phases of development has increased over the past several quarters  we believe the timing of many of these projects may be affected by the ongoing weak economic conditions and the reduced availability of financing 
these factors may dampen the pace of new supply development  including our own  in nevertheless  we did witness new competitive luxury and boutique properties opening in and in some of our markets  particularly in los angeles  miami beach  las vegas and new york  which have impacted our performance in these markets and may continue to do so 
for  we believe that if various economic forecasts projecting modest expansion are accurate  this may lend to a gradual and modest increase in lodging demand for both leisure and business travel  although we expect there to be continued pressure on rates  as leisure and business travelers alike continue to focus on cost containment 
as such  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will occur or that any losses will not increase for these or any other reasons 
we believe that the global credit market conditions will also gradually improve during  although we believe there will continue to be less credit available and on less favorable terms than were obtainable in prior years 
given the current state of the credit markets  some of our joint venture projects  such as mondrian palm springs  may not be able to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all 
if adequate project financing is not obtained  the joint ventures or developers  as applicable  may seek additional equity investors to raise capital  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that a number of recent events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance

other hotel revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to a decline in telephone revenues in as compared to  which we believe is generally consistent across the industry due to increased use of cell phones by our guests and decreased spa and gift shop revenues at mondrian los angeles as a result of the renovation during revenues of hotel held for non sale disposition decreased to million in compared to million for total revenues at mondrian scottsdale  the hotel held for non sale disposition  declined due to the significant adverse impact on lodging demand as a result of the global economic downturn  particularly in the fourth quarter of revpar for mondrian scottsdale declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management fee related parties and other income

like most operators of hotels in the non gaming lodging industry  we do not follow this practice at our other hotels  where we present average occupancy rate and average daily rate net of rooms provided on a complimentary basis 
other non operating expense decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease is primarily related to reduced legal costs in as a result of the settlement of litigation related to shore club in early and non recurring costs associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer in september for which there was no comparable cost in income tax benefit expense resulted in a benefit of million in compared to million in the income tax benefit was due primarily to the recording of deferred tax assets from our net operating loss

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million at mondrian scottsdale which is included in investment in hotel held for non sale disposition 
as of december   the maximum amount of borrowings available under the amended revolving credit facility was million  of which million of borrowings were outstanding and million of letters of credit were posted 
we have both short term and long term liquidity requirements as described in more detail below 

table of contents liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our short term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred within the next months and believe those requirements currently consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including the funding of our reserve accounts  capital commitments associated with certain of our development projects  and payment of scheduled debt maturities  unless otherwise extended or refinanced 
we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt and lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach  royalton and morgans 
our joint venture hotels and non morgans hotel group branded hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under debt agreements related to such hotels  or under our management agreements 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require us to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
in addition  our restaurant joint ventures require the ventures to set aside restricted cash of between to of gross revenues of the restaurant 
our owned hotels that were not subject to these reserve funding obligations delano south beach  royalton  and morgans underwent significant room and common area renovations during  and  and as such  are not expected to require a substantial amount of capital spending during in addition to reserve funds for capital expenditures  our debt and lease agreements also require us to deposit cash into escrow accounts for taxes  insurance and debt service payments 
as of december   total restricted cash was million 
this amount includes approximately million from the hudson and mondrian los angeles loans in a curtailment reserve escrow account which requires that all excess cash be deposited into this account until such time as the debt service coverage ratio using an interest rate is to or greater for two consecutive quarters 
further  as of december   we have aggregate capital commitments or plans to fund joint venture and owned development projects of approximately million  which we expect to fund during our million interest only  non recourse promissory notes relating to the property across the street from delano south beach was extended until january  the note continues to bear interest at  although we have the ability to defer payment of half of the monthly interest payments until maturity 
management is currently evaluating the development of a hotel on the property based on potential funding from the sale of tax credits which may be available to us 
as of december   our non recourse mortgage financing on hudson and mondrian los angeles  discussed below in debt mortgage agreements  consisted of i a million first mortgage note secured by hudson  ii a million mezzanine loan secured by a pledge of the equity interests in our subsidiary owning hudson  and iii a million first mortgage note secured by mondrian los angeles collectively  the mortgages 
the mortgages all mature on july   with the exception of the hudson mezzanine loan described below 
we have the option of extending the maturity date of the mortgages to october  provided that certain extension requirements are achieved  including maintaining a debt service coverage ratio using an interest rate  for the two fiscal quarters preceding the maturity date of to or greater 
a portion of the mortgages may need to be repaid in order to meet this covenant  or alternatively  we may consider refinancing the mortgages 
management is currently discussing our options with the special servicer of these loans 
on october   we entered into an agreement with one of our lenders which holds  among other loans  the hudson mezzanine loan 
under the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million to i reduce the principal balance of the mezzanine loan from million to million  ii acquire interests in million of debt securities secured by certain of our other debt obligations  iii pay fees  and iv obtain a forbearance from the mezzanine lender until october  from exercising any remedies resulting from a maturity default  subject only to maintaining certain interest rate caps and making an additional aggregate payment of million to purchase additional interests in certain of our other debt obligations prior to october  we believe these transactions will have the practical effect of extending the hudson mezzanine loan by three years and three months beyond its scheduled maturity of july  the mezzanine lender also agreed to cooperate with us in our efforts to seek an extension of the million hudson mortgage loan  which is also set to mature on july   and to consent to certain refinancings and other modifications of the hudson mortgage loan 

table of contents we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs for the next months through existing cash balances  including the cash received from the issuance of the series a preferred securities and warrants in october  and cash provided by our operations 
if necessary  we may also access additional borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities 
given the current economic environment and turmoil in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings on terms acceptable to us or at all 
see also potential capital expenditures and liquidity requirements below for additional liquidity that may be required in the short term  depending on market and other circumstances  including our ability to refinance or extend existing debt 
long term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our long term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred beyond the next months and believe these requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions and development of properties under contract and new acquisitions and development projects that we may pursue 
the series a preferred securities have an dividend rate for the first five years  a dividend rate for years six and seven  and a dividend rate thereafter 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments  and as of december   have not declared any dividends 
the company has the option to redeem any or all of the series a preferred securities at any time 
while we do not anticipate redeeming any or all of the series a preferred securities in the near term  we may want to redeem them prior to the escalation in dividend rate to in historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  and long term mortgages on our properties 
other sources may include cash generated through asset dispositions and joint venture transactions 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities 
given the current economic environment and turmoil in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional borrowings  including additional borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility  to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
other sources may be cash generated through property dispositions 
although the credit and equity markets remain challenging  we believe that these sources of capital will become available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders and general market conditions 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
potential capital expenditures and liquidity requirements in addition to our expected short term and long term liquidity requirements  our liquidity requirements could also be affected by possible required expenditures or liquidity requirements at certain of our owned hotels or joint venture hotels  as discussed below

comparison of cash flows for the year ended december  to december  given the economic downturn  we implemented various costs saving initiatives in and  which we believe helped prepare us for the significant economic challenges during as demand begins to return  we believe that our properties will generate positive cash flow as a result of our focus on operational efficiencies and these cost saving initiatives 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities is primarily due to changes in working capital and lower operating cash flow due to the impact of the current economic downturn

as such  the total initial commitment amount on the revolving credit facility was reduced to approximately million 
on august   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility  which we refer to as the amended revolving credit facility 

table of contents among other things  the amended revolving credit facility deletes the financial covenant requiring us to maintain certain leverage ratios  revises the fixed charge coverage ratio defined generally as the ratio of consolidated ebitda excluding mondrian scottsdale s ebitda for the periods ending june  and september  and clift s ebitda for all periods to consolidated interest expense excluding mondrian scottsdale s interest expense for the periods ending june  and september  and clift s interest expense for all periods that we are required to maintain for each four quarter period to no less than to from the previous fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to

the convertible notes mature on october   unless repurchased by us or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
in connection with the private offering  we entered into certain convertible note hedge and warrant transactions

joint venture debt 
see off balance sheet arrangements for descriptions of joint venture debt contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we also enter into other purchase commitments and other executory contracts that are not recognized as liabilities until services are performed or goods are received 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   excluding interest  except as indicated  debt obligations at our joint venture hotels  and the million non recourse mortgage and mezzanine loans on mondrian scottsdale  which is in foreclosure proceedings payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year to years to years years in thousands mortgages promissory notes on property across the street from delano south beach liability to subsidiary trust convertible notes revolving credit facility funding of outstanding letters of credit interest on mortgage and notes payable capitalized lease obligations including amounts representing interest operating lease obligations total 
table of contents the table above does not account for the extended maturity date on the outstanding promissory notes on the property across the street from delano south beach  discussed above 
effective january   the maturity on the million outstanding promissory notes was extended until january  in addition  we have a million in letters of credit outstanding related to worker compensation insurance 
we will fund this amount as the insurance carrier requires 
as described in derivative financial instruments below  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
as such  the interest rate on our debt is fixed for the majority of our outstanding debt  which is reflected in the table above 
we have a series of joint ventures with chodorow ventures llc and affiliates  or chodorow  for the purpose of owning and operating restaurants  bars and other food and beverage operations at certain of our hotels 
currently  the joint ventures operate the restaurants in morgans  delano south beach  mondrian los angeles  clift  sanderson  st martins lane  and mondrian south beach as well as the bars in delano south beach  sanderson and st martins lane 
pursuant to various agreements  the joint ventures lease space from the hotels and pay a management fee to chodorow 
the management fee is typically equal to of the gross revenues generated by the operation 
the agreements expire on various dates through and generally have one or two five year renewal periods at the restaurant venture s option 
further  we are required to fund negative cash flows in certain of these restaurants 
fees to be paid to chodorow and requirements to fund negative cash flow cannot be currently measured and therefore are not included in the table above 
on october   we issued  shares of series a preferred securities to the investors 
the holders of such series a preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash dividends  payable in arrears on every three month anniversary following the original date of issuance if such dividends are declared by the board of directors or an authorized committee thereof  at a rate of per year for the first five years  per year for years six and seven  and per year thereafter 
in addition  should the investors nominee fail to be elected to our board of directors  the dividend rate would increase by during any time that the investors nominee is not a director 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments 
seasonality the hospitality business is seasonal in nature 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
quarterly revenues also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as the current recession  extreme weather conditions  terrorist attacks or alerts  natural disasters  airline strikes  and other considerations affecting travel 
room revenues by quarter for our owned hotels  excluding mondrian scottsdale  which has been excluded from room revenues and classified as hotel held for non sale disposition  during and  help demonstrate this seasonality  as follows first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in millions room revenues given the global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and the fourth quarter of was not as significant as in prior periods and may remain less pronounced in depending on the timing and strength of economic recovery 

table of contents to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may have to enter into additional short term borrowings or increase our borrowings  if available  under our amended revolving credit facility to meet cash requirements 
capital expenditures and reserve funds we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt and lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach  royalton and morgans 
our joint venture hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under debt agreements related to such hotels  or under our management agreements 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require us to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
in addition  our restaurant joint ventures require the ventures to set aside restricted cash of between to of gross revenues of the restaurant 
as of december   million was available in restricted cash reserves for future capital expenditures under these obligations related to our owned hotels 
the lenders under the mortgages require our subsidiary borrowers to fund reserve accounts to cover monthly debt service payments 
those subsidiary borrowers are also required to fund reserves for property  sales and occupancy taxes  insurance premiums  capital expenditures and the operation and maintenance of those hotels 
reserves are deposited into restricted cash accounts and are released as certain conditions are met 
as of december   our mortgages have fallen below the required debt service coverage and as such  all excess cash  once all other reserve accounts are completed  is funded into a curtailment reserve fund 
as of december   the balance in the curtailment reserve fund was million 
if the debt service coverage for hotels securing the mortgages improves above the requirement for two consecutive quarters  the cash in the curtailment reserve account will be released to us 
our subsidiary borrowers are not permitted to have any liabilities other than certain ordinary trade payables  purchase money indebtedness  capital lease obligations  and certain other liabilities 
during  and  our owned hotels that were not subject to these reserve funding obligations delano south beach  royalton  and morgans underwent significant room and common area renovations  and as such  are not expected to require a substantial amount of capital during management will evaluate the capital spent at these properties on an individual basis and ensure that such decisions do not impact the overall quality of our hotels or our guests experience 
under the amended revolving credit facility  we are generally prohibited from funding capital expenditures with respect to any hotels owned by us other than maintenance capital expenditures for any hotel not exceeding of the annual gross revenues of such hotel and certain other exceptions 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using models which incorporate standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow and option pricing models to determine fair value 
we believe these methods of estimating fair value result in general approximation of value  and such value may or may not be realized 
on february   we entered into an interest rate forward starting swap that effectively fixes the interest rate on million of mortgage debt at approximately on mondrian los angeles and hudson with an effective date of july  and a maturity date of july  this derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment per asc  derivatives and hedging asc and accordingly  the change in fair value of this instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income 
in connection with the mortgages  we also entered into an million interest rate swap that effectively fixes the libor rate on million of the debt at approximately with an effective date of july  and a maturity date of july  this derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment per asc and accordingly  the change in fair value of this instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income 

table of contents in connection with the sale of the convertible notes discussed above we entered into call options which are exercisable solely in connection with any conversion of the convertible notes and pursuant to which we will receive shares of our common stock from counterparties equal to the number of shares of our common stock  or other property  deliverable by us to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion of the convertible notes  in excess of an amount of shares or other property with a value  at then current prices  equal to the principal amount of the converted convertible notes 
simultaneously  we also entered into warrant transactions  whereby we sold warrants to purchase in the aggregate  shares of our common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  at an exercise price of approximately per share of common stock 
the warrants may be exercised over a day trading period commencing january  the call options and the warrants are separate contracts and are not part of the terms of the convertible notes and will not affect the holders rights under the convertible notes 
the call options are intended to offset potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the exercise price of the call options  which is equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
in connection with the yucaipa investment  discussed above  we issued warrants to the investors to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a year term and are exercisable utilizing a cashless exercise method only  resulting in a net share issuance 
the exercise of the warrants is also subject to an exercise cap which effectively limits the investors beneficial ownership of our common stock to at any one time  unless we are no longer subject to gaming requirements or the investors obtain all necessary gaming approvals to hold and exercise in full the warrants 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments 
in connection with the fund formation agreement  we issued to the fund manager  contingent warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of per share with a year term 
these contingent warrants will only become exercisable if the fund obtains capital commitments in certain amounts over certain time periods and also meets certain further capital commitment and investment thresholds 
the exercise of these contingent warrants is also subject to an exercise cap which effectively limits the fund manager s beneficial ownership which is considered jointly with the investors beneficial ownership of our common stock to at any one time  subject to certain exceptions 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to these contingent warrants are both subject to anti dilution adjustments

hard rock 
as of december   we owned a interest in the hard rock  based on cash contribution and applying a weighting of x to the dljmb parties contributions in excess of million  which was the last agreed weighting for capital contributions beyond the amount initially committed by the dljmb parties 
some of these additional contributions made by the dljmb parties may ultimately receive a greater weighting based on an appraisal process included in the joint venture agreement or as otherwise agreed by the parties  which would further dilute our ownership interest 
we also manage the hard rock under a management agreement  for which we receive a management fee  a chain service expense reimbursement based on a percentage of all non gaming revenue including rental income  and a fixed annual gaming facilities support fee

recent accounting pronouncements on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which has been subsequently codified in asc  financial instruments asc 
asc permits companies to make a one time election to carry eligible types of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  even if fair value measurement is not required under gaap 
asc must be applied prospectively  and the effect of the first re measurement to fair value  if any  should be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the adoption of asc had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities

asc  among other things  establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired including intangibles  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity 
additionally  asc requires that all transaction costs of a business acquisition will be expensed as incurred 
the adoption of asc in the first quarter of will only have an impact on the accounting on future business combinations 
in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  which has subsequently been codified in asc asc provided for a one year deferral of the effective date of asc for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the adoption of these provisions of asc on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

all three fasb staff positions have subsequently been codified in asc  asc  and asc  investments  investments debt and equity securities  respectively 
these codifications are effective for us as of january  and the adoption of these codifications did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which has subsequently been codified in asc asc amends prior guidance established in fin r and changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity a vie 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is therefore required to consolidate an entity by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fin r required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qualified special purpose entities  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
asc also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
asc will be effective for us as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact that these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which has been codified in asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc 
asc  is a pronouncement establishing the fasb asc as the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap 
the asc did not change gaap but reorganized the literature 
this pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  this pronouncement impacts disclosures only and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
when triggering events occur  we periodically review each property for possible impairment 
recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  as determined by applying our operating budgets for future periods 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we estimated each property s fair value using a discounted cash flow method taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the properties  the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
as of december   management concluded that mondrian scottsdale was impaired and that the fair value was in excess of the property s carrying value by approximately million 
additionally  management concluded that the property across the street from delano south beach was impaired and that the fair value was in excess of the property s carrying value by approximately million 
this impairment is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   management concluded that all other long lived assets were not impaired 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets attributable to business acquisitions and combinations 
we test for impairment of goodwill at least annually and generally at year end 
we will test for impairment more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which has been subsequently codified in asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill  management identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  including goodwill  the asset is not impaired 
any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
management applies a discounted cash flow method to perform its annual goodwill fair value impairment test taking into account approved operating budgets with appropriate growth assumptions  holding period and proceeds from disposing of the property 
in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis  management also considers external independent appraisals to estimate fair value 
the analysis and appraisals used by management are consistent with those used by a market participant 
judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  growth rate of the properties  the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
the discount rate and the cap rate were based on applicable public hotel studies and market indices 
given the current economic environment  management believes that the growth assumptions applied are reasonable 
the company has one reportable operating segment  which is its reporting unit under asc  therefore management aggregates goodwill associated to all owned hotels when analyzing potential impairment 
as of december   management concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as the implied fair value of the reporting unit was well in excess of its carrying value 
management does not believe it is reasonably likely that goodwill will become impaired in future periods  but will test before the year end if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and generally five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed and believe that the future useful lives of our assets will be consistent with historical trends and experience 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities require us to make judgments on the nature of our derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported as a component of interest expense in the consolidated combined statements of operations or as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we believe our judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s fair value or effectiveness as a hedge could affect expenses  net income and equity 
management has concluded that the designation of our derivatives as an effective hedge or an ineffective hedge has not changed during additionally  management determines fair value of our derivatives is in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which has been subsequently codified in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the valuation of interest rate caps and interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
to comply with the provisions of asc  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
management believes that the valuation approach is acceptable and that our derivatives are properly stated at december  consolidation policy 
we evaluate our variable interests in accordance with financial interpretation r  which has been subsequently codified in asc  consolidation asc to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures 
we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the entities because we absorb the majority of the restaurant ventures expected losses and residual returns 
therefore  the restaurant ventures are consolidated in our financial statements with our partner s share of the results of operations recorded as minority interest in the accompanying financial statements 
we have evaluated the applicability of asc to our investments in certain joint venture hotels and related food and beverage operations at certain joint venture hotels 
we have determined that these ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable interest entity or we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore  consolidation of these ventures is not required 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted the fair value method of accounting prescribed in sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
and sfas r  which has subsequently been codified in asc  compensation  stock based compensation asc for equity based compensation awards 
asc requires an estimate of the fair value of the equity award at the time of grant rather than the intrinsic value method 
for all fixed equity based awards to employees and directors  which have no vesting conditions other than time of service  the fair value of the equity award at the grant date will be amortized to compensation expense over the award s vesting period on a straight line basis 
for performance based compensation plans  we recognize compensation expense at such time when the performance hurdle is anticipated to be achieved over the performance period based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
the fair value is determined based on the value of the company s common stock on the grant date of the award  or in the case of stock option awards  the black scholes option pricing model 
management s assumptions when applying the black scholes model are derived based upon the risk profile and volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
we believe that the assumptions that we have applied to stock based compensation are reasonable and we will continue to review such assumptions quarterly and revise them as market conditions change and management deems necessary 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such valuation allowance will be estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have net operating loss for the tax year and anticipate that all or a major portion of the net operating loss will be utilized to offset any future gains on sale of assets 
however  these assumptions may be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december   we had a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding consolidated debt  including capitalized lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
we entered into hedging arrangements on million of variable rate debt in connection with the mortgage debt on hudson and mondrian los angeles  which matures on july  and effectively fixes libor at approximately 
at december   the one month libor rate was 
if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually and the maximum annual amount the interest expense would increase on this variable rate debt is million due to our interest rate cap agreement  which would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by the same amount annually 
if market rates of interest on this variable rate decrease by  or basis points  the decrease in interest expense would increase pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 
in connection with the mortgages  we also entered into an million interest rate swap that effectively fixes the libor rate on million of the debt at approximately with an effective date of july  and a maturity date of july  if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually and the maximum annual amount the interest expense would increase on this variable rate debt is million due to our interest rate cap agreement  which would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by the same amount annually 
if market rates of interest on this variable rate decrease by  or basis points  the decrease in interest expense would increase pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually
