we use the terms accenture  we  the company  our and us in this report to refer to accenture plc  an irish public limited company  and its subsidiaries or  prior to september   to accenture ltd  a bermuda exempted company that  on that date  became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of accenture plc  and its subsidiaries 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal year  which ends on august for example  a reference to fiscal means the month period that ended on august  all references to quarters  unless otherwise noted  refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 
we use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance 
financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates 
this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
overview our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
revenues before reimbursements net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
although some industries and geographies where we operate continue to be impacted by the economic downturn that began to adversely affect our business in january  overall market demand for our services has improved in recent quarters 
based on new contract bookings recorded in fiscal  we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  four of our five operating groups  including products  financial services  resources and communications high tech  experienced quarterly year over year revenue growth in local currency 
looking forward  we anticipate that the level of growth will vary across segments and geographic regions and between consulting and outsourcing services 
in addition  given there is still economic uncertainty in some markets around the world  our ability to effectively respond to changing client demand patterns will be a key driver of our performance 
net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion in fiscal  flat in us dollars and a decrease of in local currency 
during fiscal  many of the industries and geographies where we operate continued to be impacted by the economic downturn 
this adversely affected our year over year consulting and outsourcing revenue growth  primarily in the first half of fiscal in our consulting business  net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
consulting net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with 
table of contents billion for fiscal  a decrease of in us dollars and in local currency 
although fiscal consulting revenues reflect the impact of the economic downturn  overall market demand for our consulting services improved during the second half of fiscal beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter  we experienced quarterly year over year consulting revenue growth in local currency 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consulting growth in four of our five operating groups  led by products and financial services  was offset by a decline in health public service  primarily due to our public service business 
we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower cost resources in our global delivery network 
this trend is resulting in work volume growing faster than revenues  and we expect this to continue in the medium term 
clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver near and medium term cost savings and performance improvement 
projects with growth and transformational objectives are returning  however  clients remain cautious  seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work 
in addition  the pricing environment continues to be competitive 
in our outsourcing business  net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were billion  compared with billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and in local currency 
outsourcing net revenues for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  an increase of in us dollars and flat in local currency 
overall market demand for our outsourcing services improved during the second half of fiscal  and we are beginning to experience higher volumes and scope expansions on existing contracts 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter  we experienced quarterly year over year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency  with significant growth in products 
however  our outsourcing revenue growth during fiscal continued to be adversely impacted in three operating groups  primarily in financial services and to a lesser extent in communications high tech and resources  by the higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings that began to affect our business after the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the fiscal contract terminations and restructurings to have a material year over year impact to outsourcing revenue growth in future periods 
in addition  we are providing a greater proportion of outsourcing services through use of lower cost resources at reduced price levels 
as we are a global company  our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
if the us dollar weakens against other currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher 
if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  resulting in unfavorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower 
when compared to fiscal  the us dollar weakened against many currencies in fiscal this resulted in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue results that were approximately better than our results in local currency for fiscal the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs 
cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  sub contractor and other personnel costs  and non payroll outsourcing costs 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services  the utilization of our client service personnel and the level of non payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts 
utilization represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work 
utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately  flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease from for the third quarter of fiscal and more in line with our target range 
this level of utilization reflects continued demand for resources in our global delivery network as well as an increase in demand in certain countries  including the united states 
we are actively hiring to meet current and projected future demand 
our cost management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost management initiatives 
we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take 
table of contents actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services  given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these cost management strategies also include executing an increasing amount of our client delivery from our global delivery network in lower cost locations 
based on current and projected future demand  we increased our headcount  the majority of which serve our clients  to approximately  as of august   compared with approximately  as of august  annualized attrition  excluding involuntary terminations  for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  flat with the third quarter of fiscal and more in line with historical levels prior to the economic downturn 
this compares with for the fourth quarter of fiscal we adjust levels of new hiring  evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand 
in addition  we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees  and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future 
compensation increases for fiscal  which for the majority of our personnel were effective september   are higher than in the prior fiscal year 
as in prior fiscal years  we expect to adjust pricing and or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of this on our gross margin 
our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to hire sufficient employees with the skills and background where they are needed  manage attrition  recover increases in compensation and or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 
gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal as discussed more fully below  the primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal was a change related to the implementation of our sales effectiveness model  which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business development activities 
sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for the fourth quarter fiscal  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities  investment in service offerings  and marketing and advertising related activities 
general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems and office space 
we continuously monitor these costs and implement cost management actions  as appropriate  to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues 
these actions include performing a greater proportion of these activities in lower cost locations 
during fiscal  we directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business development activities and we streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business development activities 
the combination of these two factors has resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for our client services personnel being directed to sales and marketing rather than to other activities  which are typically captured in cost of services 
we have not reclassified fiscal amounts to conform to the fiscal presentation  as it would be impractical to do so 
the increase in sales and marketing in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues  primarily due to expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  general and administrative costs included a bad debt provision of million  which reflected our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables  particularly from clients in high risk industries or with potential liquidity issues 
our margins could be adversely affected if our cost management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 

table of contents operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared with million for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income for fiscal was  million  compared with  million for fiscal operating margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal restructuring costs of million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced operating margin by basis points for fiscal excluding the effects of the restructuring costs  operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased basis points compared with fiscal our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs 
most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues 
where practical  we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs 
we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues
