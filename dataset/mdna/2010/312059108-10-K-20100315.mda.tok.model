critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 

table of contents a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the company s transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting i asc contingencies previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  ii asc receivables previously sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance and iii sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  which requires adequate documentation to support the allowance for loan losses estimate 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance and the general allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
then the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the general allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the general allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the general allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the company also considers trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the general allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the general allowance also captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowances 
specifically  the company uses both external and internal qualitative factors when determining the non loan specific allowances 
the external factors utilized include unemployment in the company s defined market area of fauquier county  prince william county  and the city of manassas market area  as well as state and national unemployment trends  new residential construction permits for the market area  bankruptcy statistics for the virginia eastern district and trends for the united states  and foreclosure statistics for the market area and the state 
quarterly  these external qualitative factors as well as relevant anecdotal information are evaluated from data compiled from local periodicals such as the washington post  the fauquier times democrat  and the bull run observer  which cover the company s defined market area 
additionally  data is gathered from the federal reserve beige book for the richmond federal reserve district  global insight s monthly economic review  the george mason school of public policy center for regional analysis  and daily economic updates from various other sources 
internal bank data utilized includes loans past due aging statistics  nonperforming loan trends  trends in collateral values  loan concentrations  loan review status downgrade trends  and lender turnover and experience trends 
both external and internal data is analyzed on a rolling six quarter basis to determine risk profiles for each qualitative factor 
ratings are assigned through a defined matrix to calculate the allowance consistent with authoritative accounting literature 
a narrative summary of the reserve allowance is produced quarterly and reported directly to the company s board of directors 
the company s application of these qualitative factors to the allowance for loan losses has been consistent over the reporting period 
the company employs an independent outsourced loan review function  which annually substantiates and or adjusts internally generated risk ratings and loan impairment calculations 
this independent review is reported 
table of contents directly to the company s board of directors audit committee  and the results of this review are factored into the calculation of the allowance for loan losses 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding the company and the bank and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read carefully in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
the bank is the primary independent community bank in its immediate market area as measured by deposit market share 
it seeks to be the primary financial service provider for its market area by providing the right mix of consistently high quality customer service  efficient technological support  value added products  and a strong commitment to the community 
net income of million in was a decrease from net income of million 
the company and the bank s primary operating businesses are in commercial and retail lending  deposit accounts and core deposits  and assets under wms management 
loans  net of reserve  increased from year end to year end  compared with an increase of from year end to year end deposits increased from year end to year end  compared with a decrease of from year end to year end the market value of assets under wms management increased from to  but decreased from to the changes in assets under wms management reflect  in large part  the changes in the overall us and international bond and stock markets 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in the bank s net interest margin resulting from competitive market conditions and a flat or inverted yield curve 
a steeper yield curve is projected to result in an increase in net interest income  while a flatter or inverted yield curve is projected to result in a decrease in net interest income 
the bank is also subject to a moderate decline in net interest income due to the overall increase in market interest rates 
the bank s non performing assets totaled million or of total assets at december   as compared with million or of total assets at december  the provision for loan losses was million for compared with million for loan chargeoffs  net of recoveries  totaled million or of total average loans for  compared with million or of total average loans for management seeks to continue the expansion of its branch network

provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  and asset quality the provision for loan losses was million for  million for and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for   and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in the bank s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
greater weight is given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to the decrease in net loan charge offs in the increase in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to the increase in net loan charge offs in  as well as the impact of a slowing economy  declining real estate values  and continued growth in new loan originations during loan charge offs  net of recoveries  totaled million 
table of contents for  million for  and million for loan charge offs during were largely provided for in the allowance during loan portfolio at december    and  net loans accounted for   and of total assets  respectively  and were the largest category of the company s earning assets 
loans are shown on the balance sheets net of unearned discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
interest is computed by methods that result in level rates of return on principal 
loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectible  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
authoritative accounting guidance requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
the guidance also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when there is an identified weakness that may reasonably limit the bank s ability to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not necessarily be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under authoritative accounting guidance 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
the bank considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under authoritative accounting guidance 
asset quality non performing assets  in most cases  consist of loans  other real estate owned  repossessed property such as automobiles and pooled trust preferred securities that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans and investments that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
non performing assets totaled million or of total assets at december   as compared with million or of total assets at december  and million  or of total assets at december  included in non performing assets at december  were million of non performing pooled trust preferred securities  as well as million of other real estate owned  million of nonaccrual loans and  of repossessed autos

the reason for the decline in this coverage ratio from to was primarily due to the underlying collateral value of the new loans added to non performing in  and the relative levels of allowance needed for these specific loans 
specifically  non performing loans increased million from to primarily due to the addition of three commercial real estate loans totaling million 
the allowance for loan losses specifically allocated for these three loans totaled approximately  or a coverage ratio of approximately 
the number of non performing loan relationships decreased from thirty two at december  to nineteen at december   and twenty at december  the reduction in the number of non performing loan relationships from the end of to the end of and continued into was primarily due to the reduction in non performing consumer loans  primarily auto loans  over that same time period 
the bank s other real estate owned consists of two properties with a total value  net of cost to sell  of  at december  compared with two properties with a total value  net of cost to sell  of  at december  and none at at december   one property has a net value of approximately million and consists of acres of undeveloped land in opal  virginia  and the second property has a net value of  and consists of a single family house located in haymarket  virginia 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled    at december    and  respectively 
no loss is anticipated on any loan days past due and accruing interest 
additionally  there were seven loans totaling  that were accruing interest at december   but which were considered impaired and were allocated  of specific loan loss reserves 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
there was one pooled trust preferred security with a market value of  that was current and accruing interest at december   but which was considered impaired 
at december   there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired

table of contents analysis of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on net realizable values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on the company s statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and  the allowance for loan losses was     and  respectively

the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable funding level based in part on the bank s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the bank s ability to generate funds 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company or the bank

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
the bank is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  the bank is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
the bank monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
the bank s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during
