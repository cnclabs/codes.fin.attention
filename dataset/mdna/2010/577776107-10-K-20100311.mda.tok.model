item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing improved versions of protein drugs through internal development and external collaborations and other arrangements 
we use our molecularbreeding directed evolution technology platform  along with ancillary technologies  and extensive protein modification expertise to pursue the creation of biosuperior proteins 
we operate substantially all of our research and development operations through perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  a majority owned subsidiary established in september in connection with a joint venture arrangement with astellas pharma  inc  or astellas 
perseid is focused on the discovery  research and development of multiple protein pharmaceutical programs  including ctla ig product candidates designated as our maxy program that are designed to be superior  next generation ctla ig therapeutics for the treatment of a broad array of autoimmune disorders  including rheumatoid arthritis  and transplant rejection 
the consummation of the joint venture transaction with astellas in september largely completed a multi year strategic process to position our programs and assets in collaborations and other arrangements that are primarily supported by external parties 
in addition to our majority ownership of perseid  we continue to retain a number of significant assets  including approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  including million held by perseid as of such date  our maxy g program including a licensing arrangement with cangene corporation  or cangene  for acute radiation syndrome ars  a ownership interest in codexis  inc  or codexis  as of december  and a revenue stream from maxygen s biofuels license to codexis  a potential million milestone payment from bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  and our molecularbreeding platform and intellectual property portfolio including certain additional fields of application of the technology platform not yet licensed 
over the next several years  our focus will be to manage these arrangements to maximize the return to our stockholders 
highlights as noted above  during  we largely completed a multi year strategic process to position our programs and assets in collaborations and other arrangements that are primarily supported by external parties 
highlights during included in may  we entered into an agreement with cangene pursuant to which we granted cangene an option to obtain an exclusive license to our proprietary maxy g protein therapeutic for use in treating acute radiation syndrome ars 
we received an up front payment of  and may be eligible to receive certain future payments from cangene 
in september  we consummated the joint venture arrangement with astellas pursuant to which we contributed substantially all of our protein pharmaceutical programs and related assets  including our maxy program  to perseid 
we substantially restructured our operations and management in connection with this transaction 
in december  we completed the repurchase of  shares of our common stock approximately of the shares outstanding pursuant to a modified dutch auction tender offer for a total cost of approximately million 
in march  we repurchased an additional  
table of contents shares of our common stock in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in december  we entered into an arrangement with altravax  inc  or altravax  for the sale of our vaccines assets 
we received an up front payment from altravax upon the initial closing  which occurred in january  and altravax is obligated to pay us the remainder of the purchase price over the next two years  plus a percentage of certain payments received by altravax 
in december  perseid achieved a preclinical milestone under its collaboration with astellas to co develop and commercialize next generation ctla ig therapeutics 
perseid received a million payment from astellas in january for achievement of this milestone 
revenues to date  we have generated revenues from collaboration agreements  technology and license arrangements  and government research grants and from the sale of certain assets 
our total revenues were million in  million in and million in revenues for included million in related party revenues received by perseid under its two collaboration agreements with astellas  one for the co development and commercialization of the maxy product candidates and one for the discovery  research and preclinical development of certain protein therapeutics other than maxy revenues for included recognition of the million we received under our agreements with bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and the license of our molecularbreeding technology platform 
revenues for included million of collaborative research and development revenue under a co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates that was terminated in april  as well as million in related party revenue received from codexis under our license agreement with codexis 
revenues from our collaboration research and development agreements previously included revenues from astellas prior to the consummation of our joint venture arrangement with astellas on september  as the result of this transaction  million of revenues received from astellas during have been reclassified as related party revenue 
for  we recorded million in related party revenues from astellas 
we received no other collaborative research and development revenue in or during  and  we also recorded million   and million in revenue from related party under our license agreement with codexis 
these revenues reflect amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell oil products us that began in november and an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
we expect that our future revenues will be derived primarily from astellas under its collaboration agreements with perseid  as well as from codexis under our existing licensing arrangement 
we expect our total revenues to increase in compared to  primarily due to increased activities under perseid s collaboration agreements with astellas 
our revenues may fluctuate substantially from year to year based on the completion of new licensing agreements  the receipt of any development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements  or the completion of any strategic transactions 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into any new licensing agreements  receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing  collaboration or other agreements  whether any particular research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product or whether we will consummate any strategic transaction 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing  contract research and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility 
table of contents costs  supplies  research consultants  depreciation and stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in we expect our research and development expenses to increase somewhat in the future based on perseid s preclinical development of the maxy product candidates and other preclinical product candidates 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  of this amount  million is held by perseid and may only be used for perseid s operations 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark  maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands and maxygen holdings us  inc  as well as our majority owned subsidiary  perseid 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the amounts of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark  maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands and maxygen holdings  inc us  inc  as well as perseid  our majority owned subsidiary  for which we are the primary beneficiary as determined under applicable accounting standards 
amounts pertaining to the noncontrolling ownership interests held by astellas in the operating results and financial position of perseid are reported as noncontrolling interest 
at each reporting date  we will reassess whether we are still the primary beneficiary of perseid 
if we determine that we are to no longer the primary beneficiary  we will deconsolidate perseid and record our interests at the fair market value on the date which we deconsolidate 
we would then account for our interest on the equity accounting method 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we have generally recognized revenue from multiple element arrangements under collaborative research agreements  including license payments  research and development services  milestones  and royalties 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with collaboration agreements  including license fees  and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the period of delivery of the undelivered element  typically the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the upfront payments 
table of contents are recognized on a straight line basis over the period 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  we recognize the upfront payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of the total expected effort to be incurred by us 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires us to make critical estimates in both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of its obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue related to collaborative research payments from a collaborator is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are typically required to perform research and development activities as specified in the respective agreement 
generally  the payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
under certain collaborative research and development agreements  we and the collaborative partner may agree to share in the costs of research and development 
in periods where we incur more costs than the collaborative partner  payments from the collaborative partner are included in collaborative research and development revenues and  in periods where the collaborative partner incurs more expenses than us  our payments to the collaborative partner are included in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses including associated general and administrative expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the research funding revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when the company does not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
non refundable payments received relating to substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we are eligible to receive royalties from licensees  which are typically based on sales of licensed products to third parties 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of pre clinical program assets or license agreements for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or the amount can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have been awarded grants from various government agencies 
the terms of these grant agreements range from one to five years with various termination dates  the last of which is july for existing agreements 
revenue related to these grant agreements is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred 
as noted above  we have entered into an arrangement with altravax for the sale of our vaccines assets  including the transfer of the related government grants 
as a result  these grants are not expected to be a source of revenue for us going forward 
accounting for clinical trial costs we charge research and development costs  including clinical study costs  to expense when incurred  consistent with applicable accounting standards 
clinical study costs have historically been a significant component of research and development expenses 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
the clinical trials generally have three distinctive stages start up initial setting up of the trial  site and study management of the trial  and close down and reporting of the trial 

table of contents we review the list of expenses for the trial from the original signed agreements and categorize them according to these phases of activities of the clinical trial 
the start up activities  which include site recruitment  regulatory applications and investigator meetings  usually are performed reasonably uniformly and are performed by third party cros 
costs related to start up activities are expensed uniformly over the start up period which reflects the manner in which such costs are incurred 
the start up period is followed by the portion of the clinical trial in which patients are dosed with the drug under study and results are monitored and measured 
cros also perform this portion of the study  which comprises the major portion of the expense for conducting a clinical trial 
the major driver of expense over this phase of a trial is the number of enrolled patients undergoing treatment  and as such we calculate costs attributable to activities performed in this phase of the trial on a per patient basis  and expense those costs over the treatment phase based upon the stage of completion for each patient  as reported by the cro 
after the conclusion of the patient treatment portion of the trial there are a series of activities relating to the closedown of the study and data quality assurance and analysis 
these activities are performed reasonably uniformly and are expensed ratably over the closedown period 
other costs  such as testing and drug material costs  are expensed as incurred  which is typically when the service has been rendered or the goods delivered 
cros invoice us upon the occurrence of predetermined milestones such as the enrollment of the first patient  however  the timing of these billings and our related payments often do not correspond directly to the level of contracted activities and the incurrence by us of a liability 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  to the extent contract payments are paid in advance of the activity  they are included in prepaid assets and expensed under the policy indicated above  and to the extent that billings are in arrears to performance of the relevant activities  they are reflected as an adjustment to the liability reflected in our financials at the time of performance of the activity 
in general  our service agreements permit us to terminate at will  although we would continue to be responsible for payment of all services completed or pro rata completed at the time of notice of termination  plus any non cancellable expenses that have been entered into by the cro on our behalf 
we completed a phase iia clinical trial in december the start up activities during this trial were conducted over a period of approximately six months  the site and study management activities were conducted over a period of approximately months  and the close down activities were conducted over a period of approximately six months 
the length of future clinical trials  and the various phases of the trials  will vary depending upon the nature of the trials 
restructuring charges beginning in the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan in connection with our joint venture transaction with astellas that resulted in the termination of several employees  including members of our senior management team 
under change of control agreements we entered into with each terminated executive officer  each executive is entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to three times his base salary 
in addition  the vesting schedule of each of the executive s outstanding equity awards was accelerated in full as of the date of termination and the post termination exercise period of the executive s outstanding stock options and other awards was automatically extended to their full original term  provided that any shares underlying restricted stock units are not to be delivered to the executive until such later time as is specified in the change of control agreements 
under these agreements  subject to certain limitations  we are also required to pay all of the costs for each terminated executive s continued group health  dental and vision coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of  as amended cobra  while the executive remains entitled to coverage under cobra 
in addition  as part of the restructuring plan  mr 
yonehiro  another member of our senior management team  terminated his position with maxygen upon his appointment as the president and chief executive officer of perseid 
under a retention agreement we entered into with mr 
yonehiro  the vesting schedule of his outstanding equity awards was accelerated in full as of the date of his employment with perseid and the post termination exercise period of his outstanding stock options and other awards was automatically 
table of contents extended to their full original term 
under this agreement  he also received a transaction bonus of  which was recognized as general and administrative expense 
we expect to complete the activities related to this restructuring plan  primarily related to the payment of severance benefits to the terminated executives  in the first half of in october  we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in the termination of approximately of our workforce by the end of april as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily in the fourth quarter of the restructuring charges are primarily associated with one time termination benefits  the majority of which were paid out during the first quarter of we completed the activities related to this restructuring plan in april in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our organization to reduce costs and increase overall operational efficiency across our research  preclinical  clinical and regulatory activities 
the consolidation resulted in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps in denmark  and the elimination of all employment positions at that site 
the restructuring charges are related to severance and other benefits for the affected danish employees 
we completed the activities related to this restructuring plan in may stock based compensation expense the accounting treatment for stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  requires us to recognize the fair value of the equity based awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility and future stock price trends based on historical volatilities 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes merton calculations for new grants is based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the us treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option 
the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share  divided by the stock price at the date of grant 
for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards  we estimate fair value based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for awards to employees and members of our board of directors  beginning in  the expected life of the stock options was calculated using the shortcut method permitted under applicable sec accounting guidance 
for non employee awards  the stock options were fully vested on date of grant 
when establishing the expected life assumption in prior periods  we considered the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
due to the change in our structure and operations and the small number of individuals receiving option awards in  we no longer consider our historical experience or that of our peers to be representative of future expected life 
therefore in we changed to the shortcut method for establishing the expected life assumption 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   and was as follows in thousands year ended december  employee stock options restricted stock units restricted stock awards consultant options espp total stock based compensation expense after income taxes for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of stock options to consultants was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense after income taxes in and  we recorded stock compensation expense of million and  respectively  as part of the restructuring charge 
in  the million of stock compensation expense resulted from the accelerated vesting and the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options pursuant to our retention agreement with mr 
yonehiro and the change in control agreements with our former executives 
in  the  of stock compensation expense resulted from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees 
restricted stock units during  we granted restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plan the plan representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the restricted stock units granted represented a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant s award agreement 
an exercise price and monetary payment were not required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award 
instead  consideration was furnished in the form of the participant s services to us 
substantially all of the restricted stock units were originally scheduled to vest over two years 
however  in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by our joint venture arrangement with astellas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain of these restricted stock units became fully vested on november  this did not affect the restricted stock units held by our executive officers and former executive officers  who have different equity acceleration provisions in their employment related agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock units was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense after income taxes 
table of contents restricted stock in september  we granted restricted stock awards to certain employees and members of our board of directors under the plan representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
an exercise price and monetary payment are not required for receipt of restricted stock 
instead  consideration is furnished in the form of the participant s services to us 
all of the restricted stock awards vest over four years 
the plan and related award agreement provide for forfeiture in certain events  such as voluntary termination of employment  and for acceleration of vesting in certain events  such as termination of employment without cause or a change in control of us 
compensation cost for these awards is based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we do not consider forfeitures in our computation of stock compensation expense for restricted stock awards 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock awards was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense after income taxes contingent performance units in september  we granted contingent performance units cpus under the plan to all holders of options to purchase our common stock who are currently providing services to us or a subsidiary 
cpus will vest on the earliest to occur of i a change in control of us  ii a corporate dissolution or liquidation of us  or iii the fourth anniversary of the grant date referred to as the settlement date  generally so long as the holder continues to provide services to us on a continuous basis from the grant date to the settlement date 
the cpus are designed to protect holders of our stock options against a reduction in the share price of our common stock resulting from potential future dividends or distributions to our stockholders  which could negatively affect outstanding options held by our option holders since the options would not otherwise participate in any potential future dividends or distributions to our stockholders 
accordingly  the cpus will only have value should we make such a dividend payment or distribution 
the earned value of any cpu will generally be settled in shares of our common stock 
all unvested cpus remaining following the settlement date will expire immediately 
because the value of the cpu awards cannot be reasonably estimated unless and until we make a qualifying dividend or distribution to our stockholders  we did not recognize any expense in related to these awards 
also see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
profits interest units perseid s equity incentive plan provides for the grant by perseid of profits interest units pius to all employees of the company and perseid who are currently providing services to perseid 
a piu is a special type of limited liability company common unit that allows the recipient to participate in any future increase in the value of perseid 
the pius are intended to meet the definition of a profits interest under irs revenue procedure and irs revenue procedure subject to the recipient remaining an employee or service provider of perseid through each vesting date and subject to accelerated vesting  the pius will vest over four years 
the potential value of a piu  to the extent vested  will be equal to the deemed value of a perseid common unit at the time of a liquidity event  such as a buy out of maxygen s equity interest in perseid by astellas or the sale of perseid to another company  less the deemed value of a common unit at the time the piu was granted 
as of december   perseid had granted approximately million pius 
because the value of the piu awards cannot be reasonably estimated until the time of a liquidity event of perseid  we did not recognize any expense in related to these awards 
also see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues have been derived primarily from collaboration agreements  technology and license arrangements  and government research grants and from the sale of certain assets 
total revenues were million in  million in  and million in revenues in include the recognition of the million we received under our agreements with bayer in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and the license of our molecularbreeding technology platform 
excluding the bayer transaction  revenue increased million from to  primarily as a result of an increase in revenues received under perseid s collaboration agreements with astellas 
excluding the bayer transaction  the million decrease in revenues from to was primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under our co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which was terminated in april  and a million decrease in revenue received from codexis under our licensing agreement with codexis 
collaborative research and development revenue was zero in and and million in as a result of the consummation of the joint venture arrangement with astellas on september   million of revenues previously reported as collaborative research and development revenue during has been reclassified to related party revenue 
after this reclassification  there was no collaborative research and development revenue recognized in or the collaborative research and development revenue in reflects revenue recognized under the co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates 
technology and license revenue was  in  million in and million in technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of certain miscellaneous licensing fees received from third parties 
technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of amounts received from bayer in july in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and grant of certain licenses to our molecularbreeding technology platform 
technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of a million non refundable license fee received from sanofi pasteur in connection with a license agreement relating to the development of a vaccine for the dengue virus 
related party revenue was million in  million in and million in the million increase in related party revenue from to was primarily due to an increase of million in net reimbursements under the collaboration agreement with astellas for the maxy product candidates  perseid s receipt of a million milestone payment under that agreement  a million increase in amounts recognized with respect to the million upfront fee we received under that agreement  and million of revenue that was recognized under the new collaboration agreement between perseid and astellas with respect to the development of proteins other than maxy the increase in related party revenue from to also included a million increase in revenue recognized under our license agreement with codexis 
the decrease in related party revenue from to was primarily due to the recognition in of a one time payment of million from codexis in connection with its sale of equity to shell upon the commencement of the codexis biofuels collaboration with shell 
this decrease was offset by the recognition of million of the million upfront fee we received from astellas under the maxy co development and commercialization agreement and million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities performed under this agreement during revenues from government research grants were million in  million in and million in the decrease in grant revenue from to was due to decreased external efforts on four national institute of health  or nih  grants  partially offset by increased activity on two us department of defense  or dod  grants 
external costs are passed through to each grant and recognized as revenue on a cost reimbursable basis 
the increase in grant revenue from to is due to increased activity on one existing and two new nih grants and two new dod grants 
revenues from government research grants in included million 
table of contents from one nih grant for hiv vaccine development 
in  revenues from government research grants also included million from a contract with the dod for hiv vaccine discovery that expired in october in january  we consummated a transaction with altravax for the sale of our vaccine assets  including the related government grants 
we expect our revenues for to increase compared to  primarily due to expected increases in revenues to be received by perseid under its collaboration agreements with astellas 
our revenues may fluctuate substantially based on the completion of any strategic transactions or new licensing agreements and our receipt of any development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into any strategic transaction or new licensing agreements or receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing or other agreements 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing  contract research and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility costs  supplies  research consultants  depreciation and stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily due to reduced salaries  benefits and other operating expenses resulting from a reduction in domestic headcount announced in october and completed in april  the cessation of operations in denmark in the first quarter of  decreased external expenses associated with the suspended development of certain of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates and the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials  and decreases in stock compensation expense 
the decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily related to reduced salaries  benefits and other operating expenses resulting from the cessation of operations in denmark in the first quarter of and decreased external expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates and the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expenses 
stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a reduction in domestic headcount announced in october and completed in april  which reduced the number of equity awards that were expensed during stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of our issuance of restricted stock units in may these increases were partially offset by our cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps 
there was no additional stock compensation related to the danish employees during we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by collaborators and government grants  on the one hand  and projects funded by us  on the other hand 
to approximate research and development expenses by funding category  the number of hours expended in each category has been multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort and added to project specific external costs 
in the case where a collaborative partner is sharing the research and development costs  the expenses for that project are allocated proportionately between the collaborative projects funded by third parties and internal projects 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 

table of contents the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  projects funded by third parties projects funded by related parties government grants internal projects total research and development expenses related to collaborative projects funded by third parties may be less than the reported revenues due to the amortization of non refundable upfront payments  as well as a portion of the collaborative research and development revenue that is charged for general and administrative expenses 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality and may be barred from commercialization if they are found to infringe or otherwise violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase somewhat in the future based on perseid s preclinical development of the maxy product candidates and other preclinical product candidates  the cost of which perseid will share with astellas under the collaboration agreement between the parties 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal and accounting services  and stock compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in included in general and administrative expenses were stock based compensation expenses of million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses in included the  transaction bonus paid to mr 
yonehiro under his retention agreement in connection with consummation of our joint venture arrangement with astellas 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to increases for legal and accounting services  external consultants and financial advisors in connection with the consummation of various strategic transactions in  and increased stock based compensation primarily related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock unit awards 

table of contents the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee related costs  including lower expenditures on salaries and benefits related to the cessation of our operations in denmark  offset in part by an increase in external legal and accounting costs in our general and administrative expenses during should be less when compared to  depending on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in  the use of external consultants and market analysis  and expenditures for legal and accounting services 
goodwill impairment in the second quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test due to the significant decline of our stock price subsequent to the announcement on june  of certain patent matters related to our maxy g product candidate and concluded that the carrying value of the net assets exceeded our fair value  based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
accordingly  we performed an additional analysis  as required under applicable accounting standards  which indicated that an impairment loss was probable because the implied fair value of goodwill that was recorded on our balance sheet was zero 
as a result  we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the second quarter of relating to the write off of our goodwill 
we completed our determination of the fair value of the affected goodwill during the third quarter of and concluded that no revision of the estimated charge was required 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in  primarily to reflect severance and other termination benefits for the affected employees

yonehiro and the change of control agreements with our former executives 
we expect to complete the activities related to our current restructuring plan  primarily related to the payment of severance benefits to the terminated executives  in the first half of we recognized restructuring charges of million in  of which million related to the cessation of operations at maxygen aps and million related to the restructuring plan we implemented in october that resulted in the termination of approximately of our workforce 
we completed the activities related to this consolidation in april and do not expect to incur any additional costs relating to that consolidation 
we recognized restructuring charges of million in resulting from the cessation of operations at maxygen aps and the consolidation of our operations in the united states  which we implemented beginning in november these charges primarily reflect one time termination benefits for the affected employees of maxygen  inc and maxygen aps and other costs associated with the closure of the maxygen aps facility  the disposal of remaining fixed assets and termination of various leases 
the restructuring charge in also includes stock compensation expense of approximately  resulting from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees

provision for income taxes for we recognized a tax benefit of  due to the carryback of alternative minimum tax net operating losses to  and and will receive a refund of the alternative minimum tax charged in those years 
in  we utilized prior year federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the federal taxable income to zero for regular tax purposes 
however  for federal purposes  we were subject to alternative minimum tax which was fully offset by the refundable research credit claimed under the provisions in the housing and economic recovery act of in  we generated income from continuing operations in a foreign jurisdiction  however  no income tax expense was recorded as there are no taxes in this foreign jurisdiction 
no income tax expense was recorded from continuing operations for the year ended december  deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities and the associated valuation allowances increased by million in  due primarily to increases in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and deferred taxes related to deductible stock option compensation

utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb amended the standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as amended the standard eliminates the residual method of allocation and adds the requirement to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using the vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  we will use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the amended standards 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for and presentation of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance requires that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be reported as a component of stockholders equity in the controlling interest s balance sheet 
this guidance also requires that earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests be reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense  and requires disclosure of the attribution of consolidated earnings to the controlling and noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
we adopted this guidance at the beginning of its fiscal year we accounted for the noncontrolling interest held by astellas in perseid in accordance with this new accounting standard 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods after november  we adopted this new guidance as of the beginning of fiscal year and we have applied such guidance in evaluating whether we should continue to consolidate perseid 
based on our analysis  we will continue to consolidate perseid 
in the second quarter of  we adopted new standards that establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  these standards set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of these new standards did not affect our financial statements  other than the disclosures required by these new standards  which can be found in the organization and principles of consolidation portion of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of  we adopted new standards that provide guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased 
these new standards also provide guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
in addition  we are required to disclose in interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation 
table of contents techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of  we adopted new standards that amend the other than temporary impairment guidance in us gaap for the debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments debt and equity securities 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we adopted new standards that clarify the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we adopted new standards that require entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we adopted new standards that require certain income statement presentation of transactions with third parties and of payments between parties to a collaborative arrangement  along with disclosure about the nature and purpose of the arrangement 
these new standards were effective for us beginning january  our adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we adopted new standards that specified the way in which fair value measurements should be made for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  and specified additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our continuing operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  research and development funding from collaborators and government grants and through the sale or license of various assets 
in september  as a result of the consummation of the joint venture agreement between us and astellas  we received million from astellas for its investment in perseid 
in may  we received  from cangene for the option to license certain maxy g related intellectual property rights for the potential fulfillment of government contracts relating to the treatment of ars 
in july  we recognized million in revenue from bayer in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and the grant of certain license rights to our molecularbreeding technology platform  which included an up front cash payment of million 
in september  we received an upfront fee of million from astellas under our co development and commercialization agreement with astellas for our maxy product candidates 
in december  we completed the repurchase of approximately of our outstanding common stock in a modified dutch auction tender offer for a total cost of approximately million and  in march  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on a consolidated basis 
of this amount  million is held by perseid and may only be used for perseid s operations 
we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of perseid 
astellas and perseid are parties to agreements that require astellas to fund or share certain expenses relating to the research and development activities of perseid 
under a collaboration agreement between astellas and perseid  astellas will fund substantially all of the costs  estimated at up to million over the three year option term and subject to 
table of contents certain limitations  related to the discovery  research and development by perseid of multiple protein therapeutics other than the maxy program 
the ongoing development costs for the maxy program will be shared by astellas and perseid in accordance with the existing terms of the maxy collaboration agreement 
under certain circumstances  an astellas subsidiary also will be required to provide perseid with up to months of transition funding in the form of revolving loans of up to million on pre agreed terms 
see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these arrangements 
net cash used by operating activities was million in  net cash provided by operating activities was million in and net cash used in operating activities was million in for  the uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund losses from continuing operations and to fund an increase in related party receivable 
the net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily due to the receipt of million from bayer in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and the million upfront payment received from astellas 
these amounts were offset in part by cash used to fund our operating expenses 
for  the uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund losses from continuing operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  million in  million in the cash provided during  and was primarily related to maturities of available for sale securities in excess of purchases 
we expect to continue to make investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our operations 
we may use a portion of our cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  or to obtain the right to use such technologies 
net cash used by financing activities was million in  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in the cash used during was primarily due to million used to repurchase company common stock in connection with the completion of our modified dutch auction tender offer in december  partially offset by the million received from astellas as its investment in perseid 
the cash provided during and relate to proceeds from the sale of common stock in connection with our espp and the exercise of stock options by employees 
the functional currency for our danish operations was its local currency through november  however  as the result of the consolidation of our research and development activities to our us facilities in redwood city  california and cessation of operations at maxygen aps  we determined that the functional currency of our danish operations was the us dollar after november  consequently  maxygen aps no longer generates translation adjustments which would impact the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
translation adjustments from prior periods will continue to remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
in and  there was no effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was an increase of  in the following are contractual commitments as of december   associated with lease obligations and purchase obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total 
table of contents in february  we amended the terms of the leases for our facilities to extend the terms of the leases to february  as amended  the leases include scheduled rent increases that will be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
the following table reflects the incremental contractual commitments associated with these amended lease obligations in thousands payments due by period incremental contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations we are eligible to receive up to million in potential milestone and event based payments  including up to million from bayer based on the achievement of certain events related to the potential initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of maxy vii and the satisfaction of certain patent related conditions associated with the maxy vii program  and up to million from sanofi pasteur  the vaccines division of the sanofi aventis group  under our existing license agreement relating to the development of a vaccine for the dengue virus 
under our agreement with cangene  to the extent cangene exercises its option for an initial license  we are also eligible to receive a license fee of million  as well as continuing licensing fees equal to a specified percentage of any net contract revenues recognized by cangene under an applicable government contract 
under our joint venture arrangement with astellas  astellas has an option to acquire all of the our ownership interest in perseid at specified exercise prices that increase each quarter from the current option price of million through march  to million over the term of the option  which expires on september  the third anniversary of the closing 
in addition  perseid is eligible to receive potential milestone and event based payments from astellas based on the achievement of certain events related to the development and commercialization of the maxy program 
however  there can be no assurances that either we or perseid will receive any milestone  event based payments or other proceeds under any of these agreements 
in addition  any payments related to milestones achieved under the co development and commercialization agreement between perseid and astellas for the maxy program would be paid to perseid and  as a result  such funds would not be directly available to maxygen 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on a consolidated basis 
of this amount  million is held by perseid and may only be used for perseid s operations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with funding expected to be received from collaborators  licensors and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves and a reduced ongoing financial commitment to the business contributed to perseid  our board of directors expects to consider and evaluate one or more additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of 
table of contents cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all investments and all cash and cash equivalents are held in us currency at december  as of december   of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
due to the recent adverse developments in the credit markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than one year or less 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of commercial debt securities  with an average time to maturity of days 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and the maturities of short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we have the ability and intent to hold our debt securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at full par value 
foreign currency exchange risk in  excluding stock compensation and restructuring charges  approximately  or million  of our operating expenses were incurred in euros  primarily for contract manufacturing 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
we had no such foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  or during  we recognized  in foreign exchange gains from hedge contracts 
these gains and losses were included with interest income and other income expense  net
