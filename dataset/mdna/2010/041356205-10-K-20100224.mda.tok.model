item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on february   we began doing business under the name arlington asset investment corp 
arlington asset investment corp  formerly known as friedman billings ramsey group  inc  is a holding company that through its subsidiaries acquires primarily mortgage related assets 
through our subsidiaries  we acquire on a leveraged basis residential mortgage backed securities mbs  either issued by a us government agency  or guaranteed as to principal and interest by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities agency backed mbs 
we also acquire generally on a non leveraged basis both mbs issued by private organizations private label mbs and  on a limited basis  we manage our remaining interest in net interest margin securities and merchant banking holdings  subject to maintaining our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended act 
when we use the terms arlington asset  aaic  we us our and the company  we mean arlington asset investment corp  formerly know as friedman  billings  ramsey group  inc  and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we historically have conducted most of our principal acquisitions activities at the parent company level and through a qualified reit subsidiary qrs principal investing 
historically  we have operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes and we conducted our investment banking and institutional brokerage activities capital markets  and investment management and advisory activities asset management in our former taxable reit subsidiaries trss 
in order to use the net operating losses nols and net capital losses ncls incurred at the parent level to offset anticipated taxable income of our former trss  among other reasons  our board of directors decided to revoke our reit election effective as of january  as a result  we are currently taxed as a c corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we operate primarily in the united states 
on october   we effected a for reverse stock split of our class a and class b common stock 
all share and per share amounts throughout this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split  unless otherwise noted 
business environment our mbs portfolio is affected by general us residential real estate fundamentals and the overall us economic environment 
in particular  our mbs strategy and the performance of our mbs portfolio is influenced by the specific characteristics of these markets  including prepayment rates  credit losses  interest rates and the interest rate yield curve 
our results of operations with respect to our mbs portfolio primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our interest income and the amount and cost of borrowings we may obtain by pledging our investment portfolio as collateral for the borrowings 
our interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in prepayment speeds of the securities in our mbs portfolio 
our borrowing cost varies based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount we can borrow which is generally based on the fair value of the mbs portfolio and the advance rate the lenders are willing to lend against the collateral provided 
concerns about increased mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures  declining home prices and rising unsold home inventory have caused many investors to question the underlying risk and value of mortgage related assets across the ratings spectrum 
since the middle of  commercial banks  investment banks and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the us mortgage market 
these losses have reduced financial industry capital leading to reduced liquidity for mortgage assets  more volatile valuations of mortgage assets and in some cases forced selling of mortgage assets 
as a result  repurchase financing for mbs  including agency backed mbs  has been more volatile 
the liquidity crisis could adversely affect one or more of our lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing 
this could potentially increase our 
table of contents financing costs and reduce liquidity 
if one or more additional major market participants fails  it could negatively impact the marketability of all fixed income securities  including agency backed mbs  and this could negatively impact the value of the securities in our mbs portfolio 
furthermore  if many of our lenders are unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing  we could be forced to sell securities in our mbs portfolio at an inopportune time when prices are depressed 
the payment of principal and interest on the agency backed mbs that we acquire and hold is guaranteed by ginnie mae  freddie mac or fannie mae 
the payment of principal and interest on agency backed mbs issued by ginnie mae is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  while payment of principal and interest on agency backed mbs issued by freddie mac or fannie mae is not guaranteed by the us government 
any failure to honor its guarantee of agency backed mbs by freddie mac or fannie mae or any downgrade of securities issued by freddie mac or fannie mae by the rating agencies could cause a significant decline in the value of and cash flow from  any agency backed mbs we own that are guaranteed by such entity 
due to increased market concerns about fannie mae and freddie mac s ability to withstand future credit losses associated with securities held in their investment portfolios  and on which they provide guarantees  without the direct support of the federal government  the government passed the housing and economic recovery act of  or the hera  on july  as a result of this legislation  fannie mae and freddie mac have been placed into the conservatorship of the federal housing finance agency  or fhfa  their federal regulator  pursuant to its powers under the hera 
as the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  the fhfa now controls and directs the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac and may i take over the assets of and operate fannie mae and freddie mac with all the powers of the shareholders  the directors  and the officers of fannie mae and freddie mac and conduct all business of fannie mae and freddie mac  ii collect all obligations and money due to fannie mae and freddie mac  iii perform all functions of fannie mae and freddie mac which are consistent with the conservator s appointment  iv preserve and conserve the assets and property of fannie mae and freddie mac  and v contract for assistance in fulfilling any function  activity  action or duty of the conservator 
a primary focus of this new legislation is to increase the availability of mortgage financing by allowing fannie mae and freddie mac to continue to grow their guarantee business without limit  while limiting net purchases of agency backed mbs to a modest amount through the end of beginning in  fannie mae and freddie mac will gradually reduce their agency security portfolios 
the emergency economic stabilization act of  or eesa  was enacted on october  the eesa provides the us secretary of the treasury with the authority to establish a troubled asset relief program  or tarp  to purchase from financial institutions up to billion of residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations  or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages  that in each case was originated or issued on or before march  in addition  it was permitted to purchase other financial instruments that the us secretary of the treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability 
the eesa also provides for a program that would allow companies to insure their troubled assets 
tarp funds have not been used for these purposes  however 
most of the tarp funds disbursed were used to infuse capital in financial institutions  including banks and insurance companies  and in automobile manufacturers 
some of these funds have been repaid and a debate is taking place about how the repaid funds should be used 
in addition  during  the us federal reserve  or the federal reserve  also initiated a number of other programs aimed at improving broader financial markets  such as establishing a trillion commercial paper funding facility  set to expire in february  and a billion facility to finance consumer asset backed securities  set to expire in march or with respect to cmbs  june 
in addition  in order to provide further liquidity to financial institutions  the federal reserve has provided primary dealers with access to the federal reserve s discount window and  in instances of distress  arranged financing for certain entities 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the programs and proposals recently initiated and announced by the us treasury or federal reserve will have a sustainable beneficial impact on the financial markets 
to the extent the market does not respond favorably to these programs and proposals or the initiatives do not function as intended in a sustained fashion  our business may not receive an ongoing positive impact from the legislation 
in addition  the us treasury  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe the general business environment will continue to be challenging  with continued dampened capital markets activity  both domestically and internationally  and potential tightening in interest rate spreads 
our growth outlook is dependent in part on the extent and severity of the financial market dislocation  results from fiscal and monetary policy actions  the overall market value of us equities and liquidity 
the underpinnings of these growth assumptions also form our view on prospective investment banking  institutional sales  trading and research  asset management and investment activities 
for further discussions on how markets conditions may affect our businesses see risk factors 
executive summary during the year ended december   we implemented and executed several strategic initiatives designed to strengthen and stabilize our financial and operational positions and establish an independent operating platform designed to maximize the returns to our shareholders in future periods 
some of these strategic initiatives are summarized below 
extinguishment of trust preferred debt securities consistent with the strategy announced on october   in addition to an extinguishment of million in long term debt in the form of trust preferred debt securities at a gain of million in  we extinguished million of long term debt in the form of trust preferred debt securities at a gain of million during the year ended december  these extinguishments represent a reduction of over of our outstanding long term debt 
as a result of these extinguishments  we have million in remaining trust preferred debt securities at december  sales of fbr capital markets stock we completed multiple transactions during liquidating  shares of our remaining holdings in fbr capital markets at an average share price of  monetizing million from the sales and recognizing a net gain of thousand 
the liquidation of our remaining fbr capital markets stock was in furtherance of the strategic shift we initiated to focus on a principal acquisitions strategy and restructuring our investment portfolio 
rebalancing of investment portfolio to more liquid and potentially high return securities during  we reinvested the proceeds from the sale of our fbr capital markets stock and other illiquid investments into  among other investments  private label mbs 
our focus has been on credit enhanced securities backed by residential real estate loans to capitalize on what we expected to be an attractive investment opportunity to acquire senior non agency mbs at distressed prices 
as of december   our private label mbs portfolio consisted of million in face value at a market value of million 
the average purchase price of these private label mbs was approximately of par value  of par value on the newly acquired private label mbs  at december  the yield on our mbs for the fourth quarter of was  including on private label mbs 
the yield on our private label mbs consists of coupon and accretion of the purchase discount 
given continued dislocations in the capital markets  we seek to benefit from potential high current cash returns available on these mortgage acquisitions 
we will continue to deploy the available cash to investments that offer current income as well as capital appreciation potential 
independent operating and financial platform with the deconsolidation of and the sale of our interest in fbr capital markets  we are no longer sharing financial and administrative services with fbr capital markets 
we established an independent information technology infrastructure and implemented a new accounting system during with the establishment of our independent operating and financial platform  we have significantly reduced overall general and administrative expenses 

table of contents reverse stock split on october   we announced a for reverse split of our class a and class b common stock in accordance with the previously approved shareholder authorization 
the reverse stock split was effective october  upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split  each twenty shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of common stock 
we did not issue fractional shares and shareholders received a cash payment for fractional shares based on the split adjusted average price of the class a common stock before the effective time 
the reverse split reduced the number of shares of our common stock outstanding from  to  the reverse stock split supported our continued listing on the new york stock exchange 
revocation of reit status we have revoked our status as a reit effective as of january   in part to use the nol carry forwards and ncl carry forwards incurred at the parent company level to offset the taxable income of our former trss 
at december   we had million of nol carry forwards and million of ncl carry forwards 
our ncl carry forwards and nol carry forwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
revoking our reit status allows us to use parent level nol carry forwards against our former trss taxable income and also frees us from the income  asset  distribution  and stock ownership requirements applicable to reits  which provides us with more flexibility in executing our business strategy 
specifically  because we are no longer required to derive a significant portion of our income from mortgage or other real estate related acquisitions  we will have greater flexibility to acquire other types of assets as part of our principal acquisitions activity  subject to maintaining compliance with our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the act 
in addition  because we will no longer be subject to the reit distribution requirement  we will have greater flexibility to retain our earnings to fund future growth 
with the successful execution of the strategic initiatives described above  we are now in a position to focus on continuing the execution of our principal investment strategy and increasing shareholder value 
for the year ended december   our net income from continuing operations was million compared to a loss of million in our net income from continuing operations includes net interest income of million and gain on extinguishment of long term debt of million in compared to net interest income of million and gain on extinguishment of long term debt of million in our net income attributable to the shareholders of arlington asset investment corp

table of contents the following provides analysis of our continuing operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding discontinued operations of fbr capital markets 
principal investing as of december   our principal investing activity consisted primarily of investments in a non leveraged portfolio of private label mbs and a leveraged portfolio of agency backed mbs 
we periodically evaluate the rates of return that can be achieved in each investment category and for each individual investment in which we participate 
historically  based on market conditions  we believe our mbs investments have provided us with higher relative risk adjusted rates of return than most other investment opportunities we have evaluated 
consequently  we have maintained a high allocation of our assets and capital in this sector 
we intend to continue to evaluate investment opportunities against the returns available in each of our investment alternatives and endeavor to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe will generate the highest risk adjusted return available 
this strategy may cause us to have different allocations of capital in different environments 
during  we repositioned our mbs portfolio by increasing our investment in private label mbs on a non leveraged basis

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  and for other general business purposes 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity have historically consisted of short term borrowings eg  repurchase agreements  principal and interest payments on mbs  dividends on equity securities and proceeds from sales of mbs 
in  we received million in net proceeds  recognizing a net gain of thousand from the sale of fbr capital markets common stock 
potential future sources of liquidity for us include existing cash balances  borrowing capacity through margin accounts and repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations  future issuances of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities 
due to the continued uncertainty in the financial markets  the availability of third party sources of liquidity  including short term commercial paper borrowings  was still limited as of december  liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to our business 
failures of similar businesses have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity 
liquidity is of particular importance to our business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects us or third parties 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
if we cannot obtain funding from third parties or from our subsidiaries  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
cash flows as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million representing a net decrease in the balance of million from million as of december  from continuing operations 
our cash and cash equivalents held by discontinued operations were and million as of december  and  respectively

our investing activities did not include any new investments in mortgage loans to be held for investment 
similarly  our financing activities reflected net repayments of repurchase agreement borrowings of million and million related to the extinguishment of long term debt during sources of funding we believe that our existing cash balances  investment in private label mbs  net investments in agency backed mbs  cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity and other sources of liquidity should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we have obtained  and believe we will be able to continue to obtain  short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives 
we may  however  seek debt or equity financings  in public or private transactions  to provide capital for corporate purposes and or strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
our policy is to evaluate strategic business opportunities  including acquisitions and divestitures  as they arise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from future operations  or raise sufficient debt or equity on acceptable terms  to take advantage of investment opportunities that become available 
should our needs ever exceed these sources of liquidity  we believe that most of our investments could be sold  in most circumstances  to provide cash 
however  we may be required to sell our assets at depressed prices 
as of december   our liabilities totaled million 
in addition to other payables and accrued expenses  our indebtedness consisted of repurchase agreements and long term debentures issued through fbr trs holdings 
such long term debt issuances have been reduced to million as of december  from million as of december  these long term debt securities accrue and require payments of interest quarterly at annual rates of three month libor plus  mature between and  and are redeemable by us  in whole or in part  without penalty currently or in as of december   we had million of total long term debt 
we also have short term financing facilities that are structured as repurchase agreements with various financial institutions to fund our portfolio of agency backed mbs 
as of december   the interest rates under these agreements were 
our repurchase agreements include provisions contained in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the bond market association and may be amended and supplemented in accordance with industry standards for repurchase facilities 
our repurchase agreements include financial covenants  with which the failure to comply would constitute an event of default under the applicable repurchase agreement 
similarly  each repurchase agreement includes events of insolvency and events of default on other indebtedness 
as provided in the standard master repurchase agreement as typically amended  upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination event the applicable counterparty has the option to terminate all repurchase transactions under such counterparty s repurchase agreement and to demand immediate payment of any amount due from us to the counterparty 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral ie  a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
margin calls on repurchase agreements collateralized by our mbs investments 
table of contents primarily result from events such as declines in the value of the underlying mortgage collateral caused by factors such as rising interest rates or prepayments 
to date  we have not had any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should we encounter increases in interest rates or prepayments  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result in a manner that could cause a material adverse change in our liquidity position 
in the event that market conditions are such that we are unable to obtain financing for our investments in mbs in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives  to the extent deemed appropriate  we may use cash to finance our investments or we may liquidate such investments 
accordingly  depending on market conditions  we may incur significant losses on any such sales of mbs 
the following table provides information regarding our outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings as of the periods indicated dollars in thousands 
december  repurchase agreements repurchase agreements outstanding balance weighted average rate weighted average term to maturity days days maximum amount outstanding at any month end during the year assets our principal assets consist of mbs  cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and long term investments 
as of december   liquid assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents of million  and net investments in mbs of million 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in debt obligations of the us government 
our total assets decreased from billion at december  to million as of december  the decrease in total assets reflects the results of implementing our strategic plan as previously discussed 
as of december   the total par and fair value of the mbs portfolio was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the weighted average coupon of the portfolio was dividends during we did not declare or pay dividends on our class a or class b common stock 
on february   our board of directors approved a dividend for the first quarter of the dividend will be payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  
table of contents contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements and other contractual commitments as well as uncalled capital commitments to various investment partnerships that may be called over the next ten years 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total long term debt minimum rental and other contractual commitments capital commitments this table excludes interest payments to be made on our long term debt securities issued through fbr trs holdings 
based on the weighted average interest rate of as of december   approximately thousand in accrued interest on the current outstanding principal will be paid for the quarter ending march  interest on the million of long term debt floats based on the month libor  therefore  actual coupon interest will likely differ from this estimate 
these long term debt securities mature beginning in october through july equipment and office rent expense for  and was thousand  thousand and million  respectively 
the table above excludes million of uncalled capital commitments as of december  to various investment partnerships that may be called over the next ten years 
this commitment was million at december  this amount was excluded because we cannot currently determine when  if ever  the commitments will be called 
also  the table above does not include a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits of million that are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot determine  with any degree of certainty  the amount that would be payable or the period of cash settlement to the respective taxing jurisdiction 
we also have short term repurchase agreement liabilities of million as of december  see note to the financial statements for further information 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and credit risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss through a change in realizable value that can result from a change in the prices of equity securities  a change in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates  a change in the volatility of interest rates or a change in the credit rating of an issuer 
we are exposed to the following market risks as a result of our investments in mbs and equity investments 
these investments are not held for trading purposes 
we monitor market and business risk  including credit  interest rate  equity  operations  liquidity  compliance  legal  reputational  and equity ownership risks through a number of control procedures designed to identify and evaluate the various risks to which our business and investments are exposed 
we review  among other things  business and transactional risks associated with investment selections 
credit risk although we do not expect to encounter credit risk in our agency backed mbs portfolio assuming fannie mae and freddie mac remain solvent  we are exposed to credit risk in our private label mbs portfolio 
with respect to our private label mbs  credit support contained in these mbs deal structures provide a level of 
table of contents protection from losses  as do the discounted purchase prices in the event of the return of less than of par 
we also evaluate the impact of credit risk on our investments through a comprehensive investment review and a selection process  which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk 
we review our private label mbs based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk adjusted returns on such investments 
through modeling and scenario analysis  we seek to evaluate each investment s credit risk 
credit risk is also monitored through our ongoing asset surveillance 
despite these measures to manage credit risk  unanticipated credit losses could nevertheless occur which could adversely impact our operating results 
the table that follows shows the expected change in fair value for our current mbs related to our principal investing activities under several hypothetical credit loss scenarios 
as required under gaap  our private label mbs are classified as level assets of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using present value techniques based on estimated cash flows of the security taking into consideration various assumptions derived by management and used by other market participants 
these assumptions include interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
see below for additional discussion on the valuation of mbs under critical accounting policies  principal investing securities 
credit default and loss severity rates can significantly affect the prices of private label mbs 
while it is impossible to project exact amount of changes in value  the table below illustrates the impact a ten percent increase and a ten percent decrease in the credit default and loss severity rates  from those used as our valuation assumptions  would have on the value of our total assets and our book value as of december  the changes in rates are assumed to occur instantaneously 
actual changes in market conditions are likely to be different from these assumptions dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
value at december  value at december  with increase in default rate percent change value at december  with decrease in default rate percent change value at december  with increase in loss severity rate percent change value at december  with decrease in loss severity rate percent change assets mbs other total assets liabilities equity total liabilities and equity book value per share interest rate risk leveraged mbs we are also subject to interest rate risk as a result of our principal investment activities 
through our principal investment activities  we invest in agency backed mbs and finance these investments with repurchase agreements which are interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk that fluctuates based on changes in the level or volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayments and in the shape and slope of the yield curve 
we attempt to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations primarily through the use of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and eurodollar futures and put option contracts 
we had no open derivative agreements at december  our primary risk is related to changes in both short and long term interest rates  which affect us in several ways 
as interest rates increase  the market value of the mbs may be expected to decline  prepayment rates may be expected to go down  and duration may be expected to extend 
an increase in interest rates is beneficial to the market value of our derivative instruments  including economic hedges and instruments designated as cash flow hedges 
for example  for interest rate swap positions  the cash flows from receiving the floating rate portion increase and the fixed rate paid remains the same under this scenario 
if interest rates decline  the reverse is true for mbs  paying fixed and receiving floating interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and eurodollar futures and put option contracts 

table of contents the table that follows shows the expected change in fair value for our current mbs and derivatives related to our principal investing activities under several hypothetical interest rate scenarios 
interest rates are defined by the us treasury yield curve 
the changes in rates are assumed to occur instantaneously 
it is further assumed that the changes in rates occur uniformly across the yield curve and that the level of libor changes by the same amount as the yield curve 
actual changes in market conditions are likely to be different from these assumptions 
changes in value are measured as percentage changes from their respective values presented in the column labeled value at december  management s estimate of change in value for mbs is based on the same assumptions it uses to manage the impact of interest rates on the portfolio 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
for mbs  the estimated change in value of the mbs reflects an effective duration of in a rising interest rate environment and in a declining interest rate environment 
the effective durations are based on observed market value changes  as well as management s own estimate of the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of the investments including assumptions regarding prepayments based  in part  on age of and interest rate on the mortgages underlying the mbs  prior exposure to refinancing opportunities  and an overall analysis of historical prepayment patterns under a variety of past interest rate conditions dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
value at december  value at december  with basis point increase in interest rates percent change value at december  with basis point decrease in interest rates percent change assets mbs other total assets liabilities repurchase agreements other total liabilities equity total liabilities and equity book value per share as shown above  our portfolio of mbs generally will benefit less from a decline in interest rates than it will be adversely affected by a same scale increase in interest rates 

table of contents equity price risk although limited  we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our investments in marketable equity securities and investment partnerships 
equity price risk changes as the volatility of equity prices changes or the values of corresponding equity indices change 
while it is impossible to exactly project what factors may affect the prices of equity sectors and how much the effect might be  the table below illustrates the impact a ten percent increase and a ten percent decrease in the price of the equities held by us would have on the value of our total assets and our book value as of december  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
value at december  value of equity at december  with increase in price percent change value of equity at december  with decrease in price percent change assets equity and cost method investments other total assets liabilities equity total liabilities and equity book value per share except to the extent that we sell our marketable equity securities or other investments  or a decrease in their fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  an increase or decrease in the fair value of those assets will not directly affect our earnings  however  an increase or decrease in the value of equity method investments will directly affect our earnings 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  when available  and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  management exercises significant judgment in the final determination of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical policies that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates are discussed below 
principal investing securities we account for our holdings in mbs and marketable equity securities in accordance with accounting principles related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these principles require that investments in debt securities be designated at the time of acquisition as held to maturity  available for sale 
table of contents or trading  and investments in equity securities be designated as either available for sale or trading 
nearly all of our mbs and marketable equity securities are designated as available for sale and are carried at their estimated fair values with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income or loss  a component of equity 
although we generally intend to hold our mbs until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our mbs as part of the overall management of our business 
the available for sale designation provides us with the flexibility to sell our mbs in order to act on potential market opportunities or changes in economic conditions to ensure future liquidity and to meet other general corporate purposes as they arise 
we adopted amended accounting principles related to fair value measurements as of january  this amendment defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  not adjusted for transaction costs 
this amendment also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level as described below level inputs unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that is accessible by us  level inputs quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  including our significant assumptions and other market participants 
our agency backed mbs  which are guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae  and other aaa rated private label mbs are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices provided by a broker or dealer  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the independent brokers and dealers providing market prices are those who make markets in these financial instruments 
we classify certain other non agency mbs within level of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and  therefore  have little or no price transparency 
these mbs include private label mbs  residual interests in securitizations of non prime mortgage loans  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
we utilize present value techniques based on estimated cash flows of the instrument taking into consideration various assumptions derived by management and used by other market participants 
these assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as historical data  risk characteristics  transactions in similar instruments  and completed or pending transactions  when available 
establishing market value is inherently subjective given the volatile and sometimes illiquid markets for some of our mbs and requires us to make a number of assumptions  including assumptions about the future of interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
the assumptions we apply are specific to each mbs 
although we rely on our internal calculations to compute the fair value of these mbs  we request and consider indications of value mark from third party dealers to assist us in our valuation process 
we evaluate available for sale securities and equity securities of non public companies carried at cost for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the value of our mbs and our investments in marketable equity securities can fluctuate significantly 
in evaluating these investments for other than temporary impairment  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than carrying value  the 
table of contents severity of the decline in fair value  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent to sell  and whether it is more likely than not we would be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery 
if it is determined that an investment impairment is other than temporary then the amount that the fair value is below its current basis is recorded as an impairment charge and recorded through earnings 
for unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary  a further evaluation is performed to determine the credit portion of the other than temporary impairment and the credit portion is recorded through our income statement 
we continue to evaluate unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at each reporting date and if we determine at a future date that impairment is other than temporary  the applicable unrealized loss will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded as a realized loss at the time the determination is made 
for the year ended december   we recorded no other than temporary impairment write downs on the mbs portfolio 
accounting for taxes including reit compliance related matters we have historically elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we were not subject to federal income tax at the parent company level to the extent that we distributed our taxable income to our shareholders and complied with certain other requirements 
other requirements included distribution of at least of our taxable income  and meeting certain percentage requirements for assets and income that effectively served to focus our investments into real estate  including mbs  and other portfolio investments 
holdings of non real estate and portfolio investments were limited 
no more than of the value of our total assets could consist of securities of one or more trss  discussed below 
we distributed of our reit taxable income  so no income taxes have been provided for on our book income 
in order to use the nols incurred at the parent company level to offset anticipated taxable income of our former trss  we revoked our reit election effective as of january  as a result  we are currently taxed as a c corporation for federal income tax purposes and will file a consolidated federal income tax return with our former trss other than fbr capital markets and its subsidiaries 
even prior to revocation of our reit status  our former trss were subject to normal corporate income taxes 
the financial statements include a provision for current and deferred taxes on the book income of our former trss 
the former trss  including fbr trs holdings and fbr capital markets  elected to file consolidated federal income tax returns 
we have endeavored to treat all transactions and shared expenses between the reit and our former trss at arm s length 
there are no distribution requirements applicable to the former trss  and after tax earnings may be retained 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended accounting principles related to accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment improves financial reporting by eliminating the exceptions for qualified special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets 
in addition  comparability and consistency in accounting for transferred financial assets will be improved through clarifications of the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting 
this guidance is effective january  for us 
earlier application is prohibited and it must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended accounting principles related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this amendment replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining 
table of contents which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendment is effective as of january  for us 
we do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb has issued guidance related to the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this guidance establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification or asc as the single source of authoritative gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants
