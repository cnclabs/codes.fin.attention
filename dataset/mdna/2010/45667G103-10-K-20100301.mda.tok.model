messrs 
goldman  hooshmand  hundt  koen and redfield and dr 
maydan qualify as independent directors in accordance with the listing requirements of nasdaq 
the nasdaq definition of independence includes a series of objective tests  such as that the director is not  and has not been for at least three years  one of our employees and that neither the director  nor any of his family members  has engaged in various types of business dealings with us

table of contents item a 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and in other documents we file with the sec  are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have a history of significant operating losses and may not maintain profitability on an annual basis in the future 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures related to the continued development of our business 
these expenditures may include the addition of personnel related to the sales  marketing and research and development of our products and other costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations 
we may therefore sustain significant operating losses and negative cash flows in the future 
in addition  as a public company  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
we will have to sustain significant increased revenue and product gross margins to maintain profitability on an annual basis 
although we achieved profitability for the first time on an annual basis for the year ended december  and generated net income of million  this amount included million of gross profit deferred from prior periods  as described in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
excluding the impact of this prior period amount  our results of operations for the year ended december  would have been a net loss of million 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
over the past eight fiscal quarters  our revenue and operating income loss  adjusted for  for the reasons as described in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  has ranged from million to million and from million of operating income to million of operating loss  respectively 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results 
our budgeted expense levels are based  in large part  on our expectations of long term future revenue and the development efforts associated with these future revenues 
given relatively fixed operating costs related to our personnel and facilities  particularly for our engineering personnel  any substantial adjustment to our expenses to account for lower levels of revenue will be difficult and may take time 
consequently  if our revenue does not meet projected levels in the short term  our inventory levels and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue  resulting in additional operating losses 
in addition to other risks discussed in this section  factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and our operating results include fluctuations in demand  sales cycles and prices for products and services  fluctuations in our product mix  including the mix of higher and lower margin products and significant mix changes resulting from new customer deployments  reductions in customers budgets for optical communications purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles  order cancellations or reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers  timeliness of our customers payments for their purchases  our ability to control costs  including our operating expenses and the costs of components we purchase for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation of our products  
table of contents the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors 
in particular  if we are required to develop additional features for our product for a customer  we may be required to defer our revenue for such customer until we have developed and delivered such additional features  any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our market  including any new entrants  technological advances or substantial discounting of products  availability of third party suppliers to provide contract engineering and installation services for us  the timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter  including the impact of recently announced revenue recognition standards and any future changes in us generally accepted accounting principles or new interpretations of existing accounting rules  and general economic conditions in domestic and international markets 
if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may in the future provide to the market  the price of our common stock may decline substantially 
our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be adversely affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our gross margin fluctuates from period to period and varies by customer and by product specification 
over the past eight fiscal quarters  our gross margins  adjusted for  for the reasons as described in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  have ranged from to 
our gross margins are likely to continue to fluctuate and will be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the mix in any period of the customer s purchasing our products and the mix of higher and lower margin products and services  significant new customer deployments  often with a higher portion of lower or negative margin common equipment  price discounts negotiated by our customers  sales volume from each customer during the period  the amount of equipment we sell or expect to sell for a loss in any given quarter  increased price competition  including competition from low cost producers in china  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  changes in our manufacturing costs  including fluctuations in yields and production volumes  introduction of new products  with initial sales at relatively small volumes and higher product costs  increased warranty or repair costs  and the period of time in which revenue is recognized 
it is likely that the average unit prices of our products will decrease over time in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased negotiated sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
in addition  some of our customer contracts contain annual technology discounts that require us to decrease the sales price of our products to these customers 
in response  we will need to reduce the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions 
if these efforts are not successful or if we are unable to reduce our costs to a greater extent than the reduction in the price of products  our revenue and gross margin will decline  causing our operating results to decline 
fluctuations in gross margin may make it difficult to manage our business and achieve or maintain profitability 

table of contents aggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business 
increased competition in our markets has resulted in aggressive business tactics by our competitors  including aggressively pricing their products  including offering significant one time discounts and guaranteed future price decreases  selling at a discount used equipment or inventory that had previously written down or written off  announcing competing products prior to market availability combined with extensive marketing efforts  offering to repurchase our equipment from existing customers  influencing customer requirements to emphasize different product capabilities  such as greater minimum bandwidth requirements or higher transport speeds gbps and gbps  providing financing  marketing and advertising assistance to customers  and asserting intellectual property rights 
if we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  or if our current or future competitors continue or expand aggressive business tactics  including those described above  demand for our products could decline  we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders  or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses 
our ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity 
our future success depends on factors such as the continued growth of the internet and ip traffic and the continuing adoption of high capacity  revenue generating services to increase the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of optical communications networks to meet the increased demand for bandwidth 
if demand for such bandwidth does not continue  or slows down  the need for increased bandwidth across networks and the market for optical communications network products may not continue to grow 
if this growth does not continue or slows down  our product sales would be negatively impacted 
in addition  if general economic conditions weaken  this may cause our customers and potential customers to slow or delay their purchase decisions  which would have an adverse affect on our business and financial condition 
recent turmoil in the financial markets and the global recession has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry  business and gross margins 
the us and world economic markets are undergoing a period of slowdown or recession  and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years 
our business depends on the overall demand for additional bandwidth capacity and on the economic health and willingness of our customers and potential customers to make capital commitments to purchase our products and services 
as a result of this slowdown  we may face new risks that we have not yet identified 
in addition  a number of the risks associated with our business  which are disclosed in these risk factors  may increase in likelihood  magnitude or duration 
if the conditions in the us and world economic markets remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our industry  business and gross margins may be adversely affected 
as a result of this economic slowdown and the continued tightening of credit markets  our customers may be delayed in obtaining  or may not be able to obtain  necessary financing for their purchases of our products 
a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or the continued global recession may cause our customers to delay or cancel their purchases  increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations  each of which would negatively affect our results 
continued weakness in the global economy could cause some of our customers to become illiquid  delay payments or adversely affect our collection on their accounts  which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense 
in addition  currency fluctuations relating to the financial crisis could negatively affect our international customers ability or desire to purchase our products 

table of contents challenging economic conditions have from time to time contributed  and are currently contributing  to slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in which we operate 
this slowdown may result in reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers  particularly service providers  increased price competition for our products  not only from our competitors  but also as a result of our customer s or potential customer s utilization of inventoried or underutilized products  which could put additional pressure on our near term gross profits  risk of excess or obsolete inventories  excess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  and more limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance 
the lack of liquidity and economic slowdown may adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products from these suppliers 
it may also cause some of our suppliers to become illiquid 
any of these impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for our products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our customers 
this also could require us to purchase more expensive components  or re design our products  which could cause increases in the cost of our systems and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our systems 
such events could harm our gross margins and harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
we have a limited operating history and limited history of selling our dtn systems and atn systems  both of which make it difficult to predict our future operating results 
we were incorporated in december and shipped our first dtn system in november and our first atn system in august our limited operating history gives very little basis upon which to evaluate our ability to accomplish our business objectives 
in making an investment decision  you should evaluate our business in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in the rapidly changing optical communications market 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks 
it is difficult to accurately forecast our future revenue and plan expenses accordingly and  therefore  predict our future operating results 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and dominated by large corporations  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition in the optical communications equipment market is intense  and we expect such competition to increase 
a number of very large companies historically have dominated the optical communications network equipment industry 
our competitors include current wavelength division multiplexing suppliers  such as alcatel lucent  ciena corporation  cisco systems  ericsson  fujitsu limited  huawei technologies co  nec corporation  nokia siemens networks  tellabs and zte corporation 
in november  ciena corporation announced that it had been selected as the successful bidder for substantially all of the optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel networks metro ethernet networks business 
ciena has announced that it expects to close this transaction in the first quarter of competition in these markets is based on price  commercial terms  functionality  manufacturing capability  pre existing installation  services  existing business and customer relationships  scalability and the ability of products and breadth and quality of services to meet our customers immediate and future network requirements 
other companies have  or may in the future develop  products that are or could be competitive with our products 
in particular  if a competitor develops a photonic integrated circuit with similar functionality  our business could be harmed 
recent mergers from our competitors and any future acquisitions or combinations between or among our competitors may adversely affect our competitive position by strengthening our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources  greater manufacturing capacity and better established relationships with incumbent carriers and other potential customers than we have 
many of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire  and more experience in developing or acquiring  new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies 
in addition  many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively 
further  many of our competitors have built long standing relationships with some of our prospective customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could  therefore  have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers 

table of contents we also compete with low cost producers in china that can increase pricing pressure on us and a number of smaller companies that provide competition for a specific product  customer segment or geographic market 
these competitors often base their products on the latest available technologies 
due to the narrower focus of their efforts  these competitors may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly than we can and may provide attractive alternatives to our customers 
we are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our net revenue 
in particular  for  level communications  or level  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our business will be harmed if we do not generate as much revenue as we expect from our key customers  if we experience a loss of any of our key customers or if we suffer a substantial reduction in orders from these customers 
our business also would be harmed if we fail to maintain our competitive advantage with our key customers 
we expect level to continue to be an important customer for us but to represent a less significant percentage of our revenue in than in prior years 
on july   we were informed by level that they intend to use another dwdm vendor in their network 
we believe that this vendor will be given a significant portion of level s new network deployments commencing in and will impact the revenue we will receive from level in the future 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce new products that are desirable to these customers at competitive prices  and we may not be successful doing so 
because  in most cases  our sales are made to these customers pursuant to standard purchase agreements rather than long term purchase commitments  orders may be cancelled or reduced readily 
in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order  we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business 
our operating results will continue to depend on our ability to sell our products to our large customers 
our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage  which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales  decreased revenue and lower average selling prices and gross margins  all of which would harm our operating results 
substantial changes in the optical communications industry have occurred over the last few years 
many potential customers have confronted static or declining revenue 
many of our customers have substantial debt burdens  many have experienced financial distress  and some have gone out of business or have been acquired by other service providers or announced their withdrawal from segments of the business 
consolidation in the markets in which we compete has resulted in changes in the structure of the communications networking industry  with greater concentration of purchasing power in a small number of large service providers  cable operators and government agencies 
in addition  it has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of our potential customers 
for example  service providers  such as level  have acquired a number of other communications service providers  including one of our other customers 
this increased concentration among our customer base may also lead to increased negotiating power for our customers and may require us to decrease our average selling prices 
further  many of our customers are large communications service providers that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us 
our customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing and other commercial terms and may require us to develop additional features in the products we sell to them 
if we are required to develop additional features for our product for a customer  we may be required to defer our revenue for such a customer until we have developed and delivered such additional features 
we have and may continue to be required to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with these customers  including reducing the average selling price of our products in response to these commercial requirements or competitive pricing pressures 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to comply with these commercial terms  develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continue to reduce our costs 

table of contents we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business and operating results for an indeterminate period  in several ways  including overall capital expenditures by many of our customers or potential customers may be flat or reduced  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing expenditures and inventory will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  and increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including product discounts  extended payment terms or financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices with increased sales volumes and reduced production costs  or if we fail to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis  or if we disagree on our interpretation and compliance with the commercial terms of our customer agreements  our relationships with our customers and our operating results would be harmed 
we are dependent on a single product  and the lack of continued market acceptance of our dtn system would harm our business 
although in we added the atn system as part of our product offering  our dtn system accounts for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business could be harmed by any decline in demand for our dtn system  the failure of our existing dtn system to achieve continued market acceptance  the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for  or represent an improvement over  our dtn system  technological innovations or new communications standards that our dtn system does not address  and our inability to release enhanced versions of our dtn system on a timely basis 
if we fail to expand sales of our dtn system into international markets or to sell our products to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies  our revenue will be harmed 
we believe that  in order to grow our revenue and business and to build a large and diverse customer base  we must successfully sell our dtn system in international markets and to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
we have limited experience selling our dtn system internationally and to us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
sales cycles for these customers are often very lengthy and competition for these customers is intense 
to succeed in these sales efforts  we believe we must hire additional sales personnel to develop our relationships with these potential customers and develop and manage new sales channels through resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
if we do not succeed in our efforts to sell to these customers  the size of our total addressable market will be limited 
this  in turn  would harm our ability to grow our customer base and revenue 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights 
we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  all of which offer only limited protection 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights  and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain  particularly in countries outside of the united states 
this is likely to become an increasingly important issue as we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims  and even if patents are issued  they may be contested  circumvented or invalidated 
moreover  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage  and  as with any technology  competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future 

table of contents protecting against the unauthorized use of our products  trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive  difficult  time consuming and  in some cases  impossible 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources  either of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  many leading companies in the optical communications industry  including our competitors  have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical communications technology 
we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold 
competitors or other third parties have  and may continue to assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights  with respect to our dtn system and technology 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims  or any resulting lawsuit or proceedings  we could incur liability for damages and or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated 
any claim of infringement from a third party  even one without merit  could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  and could distract our management from running our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim  if successful  could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our dtn system 
in addition  we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
alternatively  we may be required to develop non infringing technology  which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful 
any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners 
any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf  regardless of the merits of these claims  because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we incorporate open source software into our products 
although we monitor our use of open source closely  the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts  and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products 
in such event  we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  to re engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
on may   we and level were sued by cheetah in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas texarkana division for alleged infringement of patent no 
 the patent  and a continuation thereof 
on may   cheetah filed an amended complaint  which requested an order to enjoin the sale of our dtn system  recovery of all damages caused by the alleged infringement and an award of any and all compensatory damages available by law  including damages  attorneys fees  associated interest and cheetah s costs incurred in the lawsuit 
cheetah s complaint does not request a specific dollar amount of damages 
we are contractually obligated to indemnify level for damages suffered by level to the extent our product supplied by us is found to infringe the rights of a third party  and we have assumed the defense of this matter 
on july   we and level filed an amended response 
on november   cheetah filed a second amended complaint and added patent no 
 the patent to the lawsuit 
on december   we and level filed responses to cheetah s second amended complaint 
on january   cheetah filed a third amended complaint adding additional assertions of infringement for the two patents in suit 
on february   we and level filed responses to cheetah s third amended complaint 

table of contents on april   we  level and cheetah filed a joint motion with the court  agreeing to the following to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending a determination by the us patent and trademark office as to whether it will reexamine the patent and the patent  and if the us patent and trademark office decides to reexamine either the patent or the patent  to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending final resolution of the reexamination s by the us patent and trademark office 
on april   the court granted the motion staying all proceedings in the lawsuit 
on june   the us patent and trademark office ordered reexamination of the patent 
on august   the us patent and trademark office also ordered reexamination of the patent 
as a result  all proceedings in this lawsuit are stayed until the final resolution of these reexaminations 
in a communication we received from the us patent and trademark office dated december   we were advised that various claims in the patent reexamination have been allowed  while other claims have been rejected 
the pending claims in the patent reexamination are still being considered by the us patent and trademark office 
we will have an opportunity to appeal the us patent and trademark office s allowance of certain claims in the patent reexamination to the board of patent appeals and interferences at the us patent and trademark office and intend to do so 
we do not know when the us patent and trademark office reexamination process will be completed 
on january   cheetah s counsel filed a motion requesting the court to lift the stay in order to litigate those claims of the patent reexamination which the us patent and trademark office allowed 
on february   the court granted cheetah s request for an oral hearing on its motion to lift the stay 
we believe that cheetah s motion should be denied but we cannot predict whether the court will grant it 
if the stay is lifted and in the event that cheetah is successful in obtaining a judgment requiring us to pay damages or obtains an injunction preventing the sale of our dtn system  our business could be harmed 
we have experienced delays in the development and introduction of our dtn system  and any future delays in releasing new products or in releasing enhancements to our existing products may harm our business 
since our products are based on complex technology  including  in some cases  the development of next generation pics  we may experience unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying it 
any modification to our pic  including the development of our gbps pics  entails significant development risks 
at any given time  various new product introductions and enhancements to our existing products  such as our future product based on the gbps pics  are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a significant number of simultaneous development efforts 
these efforts often must be completed in a timely manner so that they may be introduced into the product development cycle for the system  and include completion of product development  including the completion of any associated pic development such as our gbps pics  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps  in turn  presents risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of our products 
new versions of our pics  such as our gbps pics  specialized application specific integrated circuits and intensive software testing and validation are important to the timely introduction of new product introductions and enhancements to our products and to our ability to enter new markets  and schedule delays are common 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of enhancements to our products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce products in a timely manner  our competitive position may suffer 
in addition  if we do not develop and successfully introduce products in sufficient time so as to satisfy our customer s expectations  we may lose future business from such customers and harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 

table of contents our manufacturing process is very complex and the partial or complete loss of our manufacturing facility  or a reduction in yields or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business 
the manufacturing process for certain components of our products  including our pic  and for our dtn system and atn system is technically challenging 
in the event that any of these manufacturing facilities was fully or partially destroyed  as a result of fire  water damage  or otherwise  it would limit our ability to produce our products 
because of the complex nature of our manufacturing facilities  such loss would take a considerable amount of time to repair or rebuild 
the partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities  or an event causing the interruption in our use of such facility for any extended period of time would cause our business  financial condition and operating results to be harmed 
minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and  in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
we have had production interruptions and suspensions in the past and may have additional interruptions or suspensions in the future 
we expect our manufacturing yield for our next generation pics to be lower initially and increase as we achieve full production 
poor yields from our pic manufacturing process or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us customer relations and business reputation problems  harming our business and operating results 
in july  we announced a restructuring plan under which we closed our maryland based semiconductor fabrication plant fab and consolidated these activities into our primary fab location in sunnyvale  california 
this consolidation of activities into one location is expected to facilitate collaboration across integration platforms in support of our next generation products 
as a result  during  we recorded restructuring and other related costs of million related to severance and related expenses  equipment and facilities related costs  operating lease termination costs  and other exit costs 
we substantially completed our restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of however  additional charges may be incurred in the future related to this restructuring  particularly if the actual costs associated with vacant facilities and other restructured activities are higher than expected 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities may not have adequate capacity to meet the demand for our products or we may not be able to increase our capacity to meet potential increases in demand for our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could harm our relationships with customers  our business and our operating results 
our leadership transitions may not go smoothly and could adversely impact our future operations 
on january   jagdeep singh stepped down as our president and chief executive officer and became our executive chairman 
on january   thomas fallon  our then current chief operating officer became our president and chief executive officer 
in january  we announced that duston williams  our chief financial officer  will be resigning from this position on june  and will be replaced by ita brennan  our current vice president and corporate controller 
a significant leadership change is inherently risky and we may be unable to manage these transitions smoothly which could adversely impact our future strategy and ability to function or execute and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  we may have excess or insufficient inventory  which may increase our operating costs  decrease our revenue and harm our business 
we are required to generate forecasts of future demands for our products several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers  which requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized 
if we overestimate demand for our products or particular elements of our products and increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize  we will have excess inventory  we will face a risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write downs and our capital infrastructure will be depreciated across fewer units raising our per unit costs 
if we underestimate demand for our products  we will have inadequate inventory  which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our internal projections  additional inventory write offs may be required 
in addition  we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers which could result in a breach of our customer agreements and require us to pay damages 
lead times for materials and components  including application specific integrated circuits  that we need to order for the manufacture of our products vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 

table of contents product performance problems  including undetected errors in our hardware or software  or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation 
the development and production of new products with high technology content  such as our dtn system and atn system  is complicated and often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
complex hardware and software products  such as our dtn system and atn system  can often contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced errors in the past in connection with our dtn system  including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers 
we suspect that errors  including potentially serious errors  will be found from time to time in our dtn system and atn system 
we have been shipping our dtn system since november and our atn system since august  which provides us with limited information on which to judge their reliability 
our dtn system and atn system may suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time 
if reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including delays in our ability to recognize revenue  costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects or replacing products  high service and warranty expenses  delays in shipments  high inventory excess and obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  delays in collecting accounts receivable  payment of damages for performance failures  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
because we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products  we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of these third parties 
from time to time  we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customers site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve  the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers and fail to add new customers 
we must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful 
the optical communications equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete 
further  in developing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors 
if the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts  market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed and our business would be harmed 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we may not possess  such as capacity greater than terabits per second 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments  we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive and we may not be able to effectively sell our products to customers who have prior relationships with our competitors 

table of contents we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  and if we fail to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will not meet our customers product delivery requirements 
we currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources 
in particular  we rely on our own production of certain components of our products  such as pics  and on third parties as sole source suppliers for certain of the components of our systems  including application specific integrated circuits  field programmable gate arrays  processors  and other semiconductor and optical components 
we purchase these items on a purchase order basis and have no long term contracts with most of these sole source suppliers 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints  lower than expected yields  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule 
further  our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all  go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us 
we may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components 
if we do not receive critical components for our products in a timely manner  we will be unable to deliver those components to our manufacturer in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet our prospective customers product delivery requirements 
in addition  the sourcing from new suppliers may require us to re design our products  which could cause delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our systems 
in the past  we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing 
in addition  some of our sole source suppliers have gone out of business  limited their supply of components to us  or indicated that they may be going out of business 
these supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future  which could limit our ability to produce the product and cause us to fail to meet a customer s delivery requirements 
such events could harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 
as of december   we held million par value of investments comprised of auction rate securities  or ars  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through auctions that are typically held every  or days 
these securities have historically traded at par and were callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest was typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
as of december   most of the ars we held were aaa rated  except for million par value of our ars that were downgraded to a rating and million par value of ars that were downgraded to aa rating during our ars holdings were mostly collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
since february  most of the auctions for these securities have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment in the near term is limited 
additionally  we may not be able to fully recover the par value of our ars or it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize our investment 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  a secondary market develops or the securities are redeemed by the broker dealer 
in october  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs financial services  inc ubs  one of our brokers  which provides us with certain rights the put rights to sell back to ubs million of our ars portfolio at par value as of december   which we purchased through ubs  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars call right 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million related to the put rights provided by the settlement and a gross unrealized loss of million related to the million par value portion of our ars portfolio as of december  which we did not intend to hold until final maturity because of the opportunity provided by the put rights 
the ars covered by the ubs settlement and the related put rights are revalued on a quarterly basis  and we recorded million of unrealized holding gains related to ars trading securities and a decrease of million in the fair value of the put rights  for  in other gain loss  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during  million of our ars were called at par value 

table of contents as of december   the remaining million par value of ars which are not subject to the ubs settlement were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
as of december   we determined that we do not intend to sell these securities and do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost 
however  given that the present value of the expected cash flows for these securities was below their amortized cost basis  a cumulative other than temporary impairment otti of million  equal to the difference between the fair value and the par value has occurred 
we recognized credit impairment losses of million in our consolidated statements of operations for the non credit related portion of this otti of million was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  if the issuers of the auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record further impairment charges on these investments and may liquidate these investments for less than their face value 
in addition  if ubs is unable to honor our put rights  the fair value of our put rights may be reduced to zero  thus adversely affecting our financial position and capital resources 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future  the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 
we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the provisions of the act require  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes  many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review 
these processes include  but are not limited to  calculating revenue  deferred revenue and inventory costs 
while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors  we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 
in the past  we have identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have remediated these identified material weaknesses  but we cannot give any assurances that all material weaknesses have been identified or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 
the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 
if we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed  our business may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  and finance personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
for example  senior members of our engineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace 
we do not have long term employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our key personnel 
because our products are complex  we must hire and retain a large number of highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the deployment of our products do not result in network disruption for our customers 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and customer service and support personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense in our industry  especially in the san francisco bay area 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining appropriate personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable  which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which can extend from six to twelve months and may take even longer for larger prospective customers such as us regional bell operating companies  international postal  telephone and telegraph companies and us competitive local exchange carriers 
our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our products 
we incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time  regardless of whether we make a sale 
because the purchase of our equipment involves substantial cost  most of our customers wait to purchase our equipment until they are ready to deploy it in their network 
as a result  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers 
in addition  product purchases are often subject to budget constraints  multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays 
if sales expected from customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all  our revenue will be negatively impacted 

table of contents our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results 
we market  sell and service our products globally 
in  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue from customers outside of the united states 
we have sales and support personnel in numerous countries worldwide 
in addition  we have a large group of software development personnel located in bangalore  india and a group of hardware and software development engineers located in beijing  china 
we expect that significant management attention and financial resources will be required for our international activities over the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our international presence 
in some countries  our successes in selling our products will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties of managing and staffing international offices  and the increased travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  tariff and trade barriers and other regulatory requirements or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets  certification requirements  greater difficulty documenting and testing our internal controls  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  effects of changes in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows  service provider and government spending patterns 
international customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our products to conform to local standards 
the product development costs to test or customize our products could be extensive and a material expense for us 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales 
we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a portion of our sales are from countries outside of the united states  and are in currencies other than us dollars  primarily the euro 
fluctuations in foreign currency rates  most notably a strengthening of the dollar against the euro  could have a material impact on our revenue and gross margins in future periods 
we have established a hedging program to partially offset our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on our assessment of the relevant risks and related costs 
however  our hedging activities may not fully offset the adverse financial impacts resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates and these impacts could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents if our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect  our business may be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability to have sufficient volumes of our products manufactured in a cost effective and quality controlled manner 
we have engaged third parties to manufacture certain elements of our products at multiple contract manufacturing sites 
there are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  particularly for international contract manufacturing sites  reliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties  potential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  potential uncertainty related to the use of international contract manufacturing sites  limited warranties on components supplied to us  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and potential manufacturing disruptions 
any of these risks could impair our ability to fulfill orders 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to meet the delivery requirements of our customers  which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our product sales 
we do not have long term contracts or arrangements with our contract manufacturers that will guarantee product availability  or the continuation of particular pricing or payment terms 
if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products or components of our products in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason  we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers  which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming and if we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer  we would likely lose sales revenue and damage our existing customer relationships 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations 
we have made strategic acquisitions of businesses  technologies and other assets in the past 
while we have no current agreements or commitments  we may in the future acquire businesses  product lines or technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or they may be viewed negatively by customers  financial markets or investors and we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume other liabilities  or incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or incur large and immediate write offs 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with our own  diversion of management s attention from our core business  assumption of unknown liabilities  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  
table of contents increased accounting compliance risk  risks associated with entering new markets  and potential loss of key employees 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future 
our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our use and reliance upon development resources in india  china and canada may expose us to unanticipated costs or liabilities 
we have established development centers in india  china and canada and expect to continue to increase hiring of personnel for these facilities 
there is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in india  china or canada will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency 
further  our development efforts and other operations in these countries involve significant risks  including difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering resources due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation  the knowledge transfer related to our technology and exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or confidential information  including information that is proprietary to us  our customers and other third parties  heightened exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india  china and canada  fluctuation in currency exchange rates and tax risks associated with international operations  and development efforts that do not meet our requirements because of language  cultural or other differences associated with international operations  resulting in errors or delays 
difficulties resulting from the factors above and other risks related to our operations in these countries could expose us to increased expense  impair our development efforts  harm our competitive position and damage our reputation 
unforeseen health  safety and environmental costs could harm our business 
our manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated by various federal  state and international laws governing health  safety and the environment  including the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs regulations adopted by the european union 
if we experience a problem with these substances  it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or could cause us to incur liabilities for any costs related to health  safety or environmental remediation 
we could also be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for storage and transportation and applicable laws 
if we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards  our business  financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
we are subject to export control laws that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products 
us export control laws also limit our ability to conduct product development activities in certain countries 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries 
changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or  in some cases  prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 
any change in export or import regulations or related legislation  shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or change in the countries  persons or technologies targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our products by  or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to  existing or potential customers with international operations 
failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis  or at all  decreased use of our products or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents if we need additional capital in the future  it may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our business requires significant capital 
we have historically relied on significant outside debt and equity financing as well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations  capital expenditures and expansion 
we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities 
we have a history of significant operating losses and for  we had a net loss of million 
in the event that we require additional capital  we may be unable to liquidate our auction rate securities 
we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  if and when we require it  our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed 
we are subject to government regulations that could adversely impact our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire us communications industry and  as a result  our products and our north american customers are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc regulations affecting communications services  our products or our customers businesses could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders 
further  we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
any failure to obtain such approvals could harm our business and operating results 
natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 
our headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure  including our pic manufacturing facility  are located in northern california  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
further  a terrorist attack aimed at northern california or at our nation s energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our products 
in the event that an earthquake  terrorist attack or other catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities  or certain of our contract manufacturers facilities  destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time  our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future 
the trading prices of our common stock and the securities of other technology companies have been and may continue to be highly volatile 
further  our common stock has limited prior trading history 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new services or service enhancements  strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors  the gain or loss of customers  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in the estimates of our future operating results or external guidance on those results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  and 
table of contents adoption or modification of regulations  policies  procedures or programs applicable to our business 
in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition or operating results 
the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
each of these factors  among others  could harm the value of your investment in our common stock 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them 
if a suit were filed against us  regardless of its merits or outcome  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company  the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview infinera was founded in december with a unique vision for optical networking 
prior to infinera  service provider optical networks were built from fairly commoditized products  broadly known as dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm systems 
the pace of bandwidth growth in service provider networks has been significant over the last few years 
thus each year  service providers generally have been consuming more space  more power  and more of their human resources to deploy and manage their optical networks 
the infinera vision is that photonic integration offers a solution to this problem 
photonic integration is predicated upon the belief that  it is possible to generate a moore s law like continuous improvement in capacity per device or chip to help service providers scale their network bandwidth without significant increases in space  power or operational workload 
infinera s flagship product offering is an optical telecom system  the digital transport node system dtn system 
the dtn system uses photonic integrated circuits  or pics  to generate gigabits per second gbps of optical capacity per line card 
this capacity is then digitally virtualized so that it can be allocated  using software  to a variety of service types 
the dtn system includes intelligent software that is designed to simplify and speed the delivery and control of optical services  and to enable advanced feature capabilities 
photonic integration provides the basis for the dtn system s power and space advantages relative to conventional dwdm systems  while the dtn system s bandwidth virtualization capability and software intelligence are architected to allow infinera customers to simplify and speed their operations tasks  and ultimately to improve operational efficiency 
infinera s digital optical network architecture is made possible by what we believe to be the world s only commercially deployed  large scale pic 
our pics transmit and receive gbps of optical capacity and incorporate the functionality of over discrete optical devices into a pair of indium phosphide chips 
their function is to convert gbps of optical capacity into electronic signals 
once electronic  these signals can be virtualized and allocated to a number of services using digital technology 
the pics enable the dtn system to deliver a wide range of transport services  with optional advanced features  quickly and easily 
by contrast  competitive dwdm platforms  which do not have access to pic technology  generally require photonics equipment to add new services to the network 
photonic engineering can be considerably slower and more difficult than digital engineering  as a result  we believe competitive platforms have less flexibility  take longer to provision  and are harder to operate than the dtn system 
in  we expanded our addressable market by introducing a new product  the atn system  which extends the benefits of an infinera network into smaller locations in the metro access network 
we also introduced new submarine network capabilities into the dtn system 
as a result  infinera now offers end to end optical networking solutions from the metro edge  through the regional and long haul terrestrial network  all the way to the submarine network terminal 

table of contents our goal is to be a leading provider of optical communications systems to operators of optical networks  including telecom carriers  cable operators  internet or content service providers  and others 
our revenue growth will depend on the continued acceptance of our products  growth of communications traffic and the proliferation of next generation bandwidth intensive services  which are expected to drive the need for increased levels of bandwidth 
our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability will be directly affected by the level of acceptance of our products in the long haul and metro dwdm markets and by our ability to cost effectively develop and sell innovative products that leverage our technology advantages 
as of december   we have sold our network systems for deployment in the optical networks of customers worldwide  including cox communications  deutsche telekom  global crossing  interoute and level communications level 
we do not have long term purchase commitments with our customers 
to date  a few of our customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in particular  level accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
in july  we were informed by level that they intended to use another dwdm vendor in their network 
we believe that this vendor will be given a significant portion of level s new network deployments commencing in  and will impact the revenue we will receive from level in the future 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california  with employees located throughout the united states  europe and the asia pacific region 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the united states and internationally to develop our product and provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
we primarily sell our products through our direct sales force  with a small portion sold indirectly through resellers 
we derived of our revenue from direct sales to customers for the year ended december  we derived of our revenue from direct sales to customers for each of the years ended december  and december  we expect to continue generating a substantial majority of our revenue from direct sales in the future 
our revenue trends prior to december  had been significantly impacted by the timing of our attainment of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for most of our services and are not indicative of revenue trends in and future periods 
prior to the first quarter of  revenue from product sales sold in combination with services bundled product sales was deferred and recognized ratably over a period of approximately one year 
this resulted in the accumulation of million of deferred revenue and million of associated deferred inventory costs on the balance sheet as of december  we recognized million of this deferred revenue and million of associated deferred inventory costs in in addition  the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services beginning in the first quarter of required us to recognize a majority of our product sales as revenue in the period in which the bundled products were accepted by the customer 
the combined effect of the recognition of the deferred revenue from prior periods and the upfront recognition of revenue from bundled product sales in resulted in significantly increased levels of revenue  gross margin and net income for in  we did not recognize significant amounts of product related deferred revenue and deferred gross profit from prior periods and do not expect to do so in the future 
the table below illustrates our results as reported and excluding the impact of the recognition of deferred amounts from prior periods year ended december  as reported results pre vsoe deferred adjustments as adjusted results in thousands  except gross margin revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin income loss from operations net income loss we believe that these adjusted amounts  as presented in the as adjusted results column of the table above  are more indicative of the revenue and gross margins generated directly from our sales and invoiced shipment activities 
our and future period product revenues and gross margins are expected to more closely approximate our invoiced shipment results with no further significant releases of deferred amounts from prior periods 
our future product revenues will therefore be largely driven by our underlying invoiced shipment trends 
our near term year over year and quarter over quarter growth in invoiced shipments will likely be volatile and may be impacted by several factors including general economic and market conditions  the timing of large product deployments  acquisitions of new customers and development of new products 

table of contents we will continue to make significant investments in the business  and currently management believes that operating expenses will be approximately million to million  including stock based compensation expense  for in july  we announced a restructuring plan under which we closed our maryland based semiconductor fabrication plant fab and consolidated these activities into our primary fab location in sunnyvale  california 
this consolidation of activities into one location is expected to facilitate collaboration across integration platforms in support of our next generation products 
as a result  during  we recorded million of restructuring and other related costs including severance and related expenses  equipment and facilities related costs  operating lease termination costs  and other exit costs 
equipment and facilities related costs primarily consist of increased depreciation expense related to restructured assets caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under the approved restructuring plan 
we substantially completed our restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of future payments of approximately million primarily associated with severance and related expenses and operating lease termination and related costs are expected to be made through additional charges may be incurred in the future related to this restructuring  particularly if the actual costs associated with vacant facilities and other restructured activities are higher than expected 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we currently expect to experience an approximate quarterly gross margin improvement as a result of the closure of the maryland fab and the consolidation of those activities with our other operations 
see note  restructuring and other related costs to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
on june   our stockholders approved the option exchange program the program  and on january   we launched this one time stock option exchange program pursuant to which eligible employees were able to exchange certain outstanding stock options under our equity incentive plan with an exercise price greater than or equal to per share and a grant date on or before january   for a lesser amount of new rsus or  for new stock options for senior executives 
the program was approved by our stockholders in june and was available for employees of the company residing in the us  india and uk who held eligible shares 
the program expired on february   and there were  shares tendered for exchange 
all surrendered options were cancelled effective as of the expiration of the program  and immediately thereafter  infinera granted i new options with an exercise price of per share to purchase an aggregate of  shares of infinera common stock and ii rsus of  shares of infinera common stock 
overview of consolidated financial data revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our products  support and services 
our revenue is comprised of three components product revenue  ratable product and related support and services revenue  or ratable revenue and services revenue 
product revenue primarily relates to bundled products that are sold only with services for which vsoe of fair value has already been established and therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method 
product revenue also includes products that are sold without services or a small amount of product sales where software is considered incidental 
our dtn system and atn system are integrated with software that is more than incidental to the functionality of our equipment 
we refer to the integration of our dtn system and atn system with our software and related support and services as a bundled product 
we recognize the majority of our revenue pursuant to the software revenue recognition subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
for arrangements with multiple elements which include product and services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element using the residual method based on vsoe of fair value for each of the undelivered elements 
however  when these transactions also include undelivered services for which vsoe has not been established  product revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the longest remaining service period 

table of contents services revenue is comprised of revenue related to services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  revenue related to services which were sold on a standalone basis or revenue related to extended hardware warranty sales 
the following table illustrates our revenue for the years ended december   december  and december  years ended december  december  december  in thousands revenue product ratable product and related support and services services total revenue total revenue 
total revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
however  as explained above  revenue for was unusually high and included million of revenue related to reductions in the deferred revenue balances related to prior periods 
excluding this non recurring deferred revenue impact  revenue in would have been million as compared to revenue in of million  resulting in a decrease in revenue on a year over year basis of million 
this reduction in revenue was primarily due to the impact of the recent economic downturn on sales of our dtn systems to existing customers in the first half of this decline in revenue was partially offset by the recognition of revenue on a number of large deployments with new and certain existing customers that were completed and recognized as revenue in the second and third quarters of in addition  we began to see a recovery in overall product sales in the fourth quarter of product revenue 
product revenue consists of products that are sold without services or bundled products that are sold with services for which vsoe of fair value has already been established and therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a sales agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value for software warranty  software subscription  training and installation and deployment services is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when these services are sold separately 
we attained vsoe of fair value for software subscription services in the first quarter of  for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of and for spares management and on site hardware replacement services in the fourth quarter of product revenue of million and million was recognized for and  respectively 
the decline in product revenues was primarily due to reduced sales of our dtn systems to existing customers in the first half of partially offset by the recognition of revenue on a number of large deployments with new and certain existing customers that were completed and recognized as revenue in the second and third quarters of in addition  we began to see a recovery in overall product sales in the fourth quarter of as customer purchases returned to normal levels 
ratable product and related support and services revenue 
substantially all of our product sales are sold in combination with support services  which consist of software warranty or software subscription services 
in addition  we have sold training  installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services with a significant number of these bundled sales 
vsoe of fair value for support services  training and installation and deployment services is determined by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when these services are sold separately 
support services are comprised of software warranty and software subscription services 
software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases and patches during the warranty support period 
software subscription also includes maintenance releases and patches and provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period 
in order to establish vsoe for these services  we were required to establish a history of selling these services separately at a consistent price 
prior to december   we had not established vsoe of fair value for support services  training or installation and deployment services 
as a result  prior to that date  when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met and the only undelivered element was support services  training or installation and deployment services  revenue was deferred and recognized ratably over the longest undelivered service period 
the undelivered service period for these services ranged from one to five years and averaged months in the fourth quarter of this resulted in the majority of our invoiced shipments in being deferred and recognized over an average period of months 
revenue related to these arrangements in that period was included in ratable product and related support and services revenue 

table of contents we attained vsoe of fair value for software subscription services in the first quarter of  for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of and for spares management and on site hardware replacement services in the fourth quarter of as a result  throughout  we were no longer required to ratably recognize product revenue for sales transactions where products were sold with services for which vsoe had been attained 
this change resulted in a significant increase in product and services revenue recognized at the time of customer acceptance offset by a reduction in ratable revenue and additions to deferred revenue for the year 
following the attainment of vsoe for most of our services during  we were required to recognize the majority of our invoiced shipments in as product and services revenue at the time of customer acceptance 
ratable revenue for reduced significantly and related primarily to a small portion of our shipments where products are sold in combination with software warranty and other services for which vsoe has not yet been established and amounted to million in services revenue 
services revenue is comprised of revenue related to bundled services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  revenue related to services which were sold on a standalone basis or revenue related to extended hardware warranty and other non bundled services 
we attained vsoe of fair value for most of our services during and have since recognized revenue from delivered training and installation and deployment services  software subscription services  spares management services  and on site hardware replacement services as services revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
in  we recorded million of services revenue of which approximately of the services revenue recorded related to software subscription services  with related to installation and deployment services and related to all other services 
we expect to see some growth in services revenue in the future as we sell increasing levels of extended hardware warranty 
deferred revenue 
prior to december   a portion of our invoiced shipments of bundled products and services were recognized as revenue in such quarter and the remainder was recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue increased each quarter by the amount of invoiced shipments of bundled products and services in that quarter and decreased by the amount of ratable revenue recognized from invoiced shipments of bundled products and services 
following the attainment of vsoe of fair value on most of our services during  the majority of our invoiced shipments are recognized as revenue in the same period in which they are accepted by the customer 
as a result  our deferred revenue balance now represents a smaller portion of our shipments where products are sold in combination with software warranty and other services for which vsoe has not yet been established or shipments where the revenue arrangement is not complete and revenue therefore cannot be recognized 
our services deferred revenue balance relates to deferred software subscription  extended hardware warranty and spares management and on site hardware replacement services sales which will be recognized as services revenue on a ratable basis over the remaining contractual period and also relates to deferred training and deployment and installation services which will be recognized as services revenue upon delivery of the services

total cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing network components  such as personnel costs  stock based compensation  raw materials  overhead  services costs and period costs 
period costs consist primarily of freight and logistics costs  manufacturing ramp up costs  expenses for inventory obsolescence  lower of cost or market lcm adjustments  and warranty obligations  and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
all other costs of revenue are recognized in the same period as the corresponding revenue 
we continue to develop and introduce new products to the market on an ongoing basis and may experience some increase in inventory write downs in future periods as we manage these product transitions 
in addition  the cost of some of our products may increase in future periods due to changes in yields and production volumes for these products 
the initial deployment of our dtn system and atn system involve the installation of common equipment  including a chassis  optical line amplifiers and related equipment 
this common equipment is typically sold at low or negative gross margins 
when we sell equipment at a loss  the losses are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated and often in advance of the recognition of the related revenue 
we refer to these losses as lower of cost or market adjustments  or lcm adjustments 
the amount of lcm adjustments recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in any period may fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of inventory and purchase commitments in place for these products and the pricing agreed with customers

cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue consists of the costs of manufacturing network components  such as personnel costs  stock based compensation  raw materials  overhead and period costs related to those sales recognized as product revenue in the period 
period costs consist primarily of shipping fees  logistics costs  manufacturing ramp up costs  expenses for inventory obsolescence  lcm adjustments  and warranty obligations  and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
cost of ratable product and related support and services revenue 
cost of ratable product and related support and services revenue consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing our network equipment  including personnel costs  stock based compensation  raw materials  overhead and period costs related to those sales recognized as ratable product and related support and services revenue as described above 
period costs associated with ratable product and related support and services revenue are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
all other costs of ratable product and related support and services revenue are initially recorded as deferred inventory costs and are subsequently recognized in the same period as the corresponding revenue 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of the costs of providing our service offerings  including personnel costs  stock based compensation and costs associated with third party service providers 
restructuring and other costs related to cost of revenue

gross margin gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the product mix  average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  changes to our manufacturing costs  including the impact of fluctuations in yields and production volumes  the amount of revenue that is recognized up front versus deferred and the period over which that revenue is recognized  and the amount of common equipment sold at a loss causing an lcm adjustment

year ended december  as reported results pre vsoe deferred adjustments as adjusted results in thousands  except revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin the prices paid for our dtn systems vary by customer 
in addition  the quantity of dtn systems purchased by each of our customers varies from quarter to quarter depending on our customers needs for optical transport equipment 
to the extent that a customer with lower contractual prices purchases significant quantities of our dtn systems that comprise a significant portion of the dtn systems we sell within a quarter  our gross margin for such a quarter would be lower 
in addition  pricing for optical communications systems  such as our dtn system  is very competitive and we must often respond to these competitive pressures by decreasing the initial purchase price of our product 
as a result of these competitive pressures and in order to gain new customers  our common equipment is typically sold at low margins or at a loss 
our digital line modules dlms  tributary adapter modules tams  and tributary optical modules toms are typically sold at higher gross margins 
these higher margin sales positively impact overall gross margin 
because of the significant impact that changes in product and customer mix and the timing of new customer deployments have on our gross margin levels  we experience significant gross margin volatility on a quarter over quarter basis 

table of contents in addition  forecasted sales of negative margin common equipment can result in increased lcm adjustments in order to record inventory and purchase commitments at their net realizable value 
these lcm adjustments are recognized in advance of the recognition of the related revenue and result in lower gross margins in the periods in which the lcm adjustments are recorded 
as illustrated in the table above  revenue and gross profit in were unusually high due to the impact of the attainment of vsoe of fair value for software subscription services in the first quarter of and for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of this change resulted in the recognition of million of gross profit related to reductions in the deferred revenue and deferred inventory cost balances in in addition  the change resulted in the recognition of million of gross profit in from invoiced shipments in the period 
gross profit of million for  primarily reflects sales in the period and does not include the recognition of significant amounts of deferred gross profit from prior periods 
excluding the prior period impact described above from the results  gross margin for would have been compared to gross margin of for as further discussed in the section titled  results of operations  below  gross margin in as compared to was significantly impacted by the recognition of revenue related to large lower margin common equipment deployments with new and existing customers and lower sales of our higher margin tam and dlm products particularly in the first half of the year 
gross margin in were as compared to in however  prior to december   we had not attained vsoe of fair value for most of our services and were required to recognize much of our revenue ratably over the longest undelivered service period 
this requirement resulted in the deferral of million of revenue and million of gross profit related to invoiced shipments 
as described above  these deferral amounts were subsequently recognized as revenue and gross profit in excluding the impacts of vsoe related deferrals from and  adjusted gross margin resulted in for both years 
although it is difficult to predict gross margin in future periods  we expect to continue to add new customers to our customer base and to continue to win new opportunities with existing customers resulting in significant common equipment deployments in which may negatively impact gross margin 
we expect this to be offset by some continued improvement in tam sales over the volumes experienced in as customers continue to grow their existing networks 
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  and are recognized as incurred 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we hire new employees to support our anticipated long term growth 
we currently expect total operating expenses will be approximately million to million  including stock based compensation expense  for research and development expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily include salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense  prototype and new product spending  and facilities costs and other related expenses 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts both in the united states and internationally because we believe that they are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense  sales commissions  marketing and facilities costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel both in the united states and internationally to support our expected revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense and facilities related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  and fees for professional services 
professional services principally consist of outside legal  audit and information technology consulting costs 

table of contents restructuring and other related costs include severance and related expenses  equipment and facilities related costs  operating lease termination costs  and other exit costs related to the restructuring plan announced in july  under which we closed our maryland based semiconductor fab 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on our cash and short term and long term investment balances  gains or losses on sale of assets and investments  foreign currency transactions and translations  changes in the fair value of our ars trading securities and put rights  other than temporary credit impairment losses on our available for sale ars and realized gains or losses on investments 
during  other income expense  net  also included an adjustment to record our convertible preferred stock warrants at fair value 
if interest rates continue to fluctuate due to current global market conditions  we will experience volatility in future interest income from our cash and short term and long term investment balances  assuming consistent investment levels 
provision for income taxes during  we recognized a current tax benefit of approximately million for a reversal of the federal and state tax provision  following a favorable ruling by the internal revenue service in the third quarter of exclusive of this one time benefit  we recognized income tax expense of approximately million  on pre tax book losses of million  for exclusive of this one time benefit  the resulting effective tax rate of for differs from the expected statutory rate of based upon unbenefited us losses  non deductible stock compensation charges and foreign taxes provided on foreign subsidiary earnings  offset by the benefit related to refundable research and development tax credits 
this compares to an effective tax rate of approximately for  which reflects tax benefits arising from the release of certain valuation allowance on domestic tax attribute carryforwards which was partially offset by the impact of certain non deductible stock compensation charges  federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates and assumptions made by management include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  accrued warranty  fair value measurement of investments  cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  other than temporary impairments and accounting for income taxes 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
revenue recognition our networking products are generally integrated with software that is more than incidental to the functionality of the equipment 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of cash discounts 
substantially all of our product sales are sold in combination with software support services comprised of either software warranty or software subscription services 
in addition  we periodically sell training  installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services with our product sales 
software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases and patches during the warranty support period 
software subscription also includes maintenance releases and patches and provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period 
training services include the right to a specified number of training classes over the term of the arrangement 
installation and deployment services may include customer site assessments  equipment installation and testing 
spares management and on site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective units at customer sites in accordance with specified service level agreements 
product revenue consists of products that are sold without services or bundled products that are sold with services for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value has already been established and  therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a sales agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value for software warranty  software subscription  training and installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when these services are sold separately 

table of contents prior to the first quarter of  we had not established vsoe of fair value for our support services and  therefore recognized all revenue for transactions bundled with these services ratably over the longest remaining support period which ranges from one to five years 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and related support and services revenue 
we determined that we had established vsoe of fair value for software subscription in the first quarter of  for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of and for spares management and on site hardware replacement services in the fourth quarter of for arrangements with multiple elements which include product and software subscription services and or training and installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services  we allocate revenue to the undelivered elements using the residual method based on vsoe of fair value for each such element and the remainder is recognized as product revenue 
however  when these transactions also include undelivered services for which vsoe of fair value has not been established  revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the longest remaining support period 
upon completion of the services for which vsoe of fair value has not been established  the difference between the vsoe of fair value for the remaining related service periods and the remaining unrecognized portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as ratable product and related support and services revenue 
services revenue includes software subscription services  training  installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services and extended hardware warranty services 
revenue from software subscription  spares management and on site hardware replacement services and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one year 
a majority of our customers have exercised the option to purchase software subscription services on an ongoing basis 
revenue related to training and installation and deployment services is recognized as the services are completed 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
in addition  shipping documents and customer acceptances  when applicable  are used to verify delivery and transfer of title 
revenue is recognized only when title and risk of loss pass to customers 
in instances where acceptance of the product occurs upon formal written acceptance  revenue is deferred until such written acceptance has been received 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days from invoice  which are considered to be standard payment terms 
however  payment terms greater than days but less than or equal to one year from invoice may be considered standard if payment is supported by an irrevocable commercial letter of credit loc issued by a creditworthy bank or the loc has been accepted and confirmed by a creditworthy bank 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and  therefore  revenue is not recognized until the fees become fixed or determinable which we believe is when they are legally due and payable 
we assess our ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer 
for sales to resellers  the same revenue recognition criteria apply 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a reseller 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection to our resellers 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and related shipping costs are included in product cost 
we report revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities  with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period generally the vesting period under the straight line amortization method 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
for new hire grants  options typically vest with respect to of the shares one year after the option s vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over three years  commencing one year after the vesting commencement date 
for annual refresh grants  options typically vest ratably on a monthly basis over three  four or five years 
in the third quarter of  we granted retention options to executives which vest ratably on a monthly basis over two years 
we make a number of estimates and assumptions in determining stock based compensation related to options including the following the expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on our historical forfeiture data and compensation costs are recognized only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the estimation of the forfeiture rate requires judgment  and to the extent actual forfeitures differ from expectations  changes in estimate will be recorded as an adjustment in the period when such estimates are revised 
actual results may differ substantially from the estimates 
commencing in june  we elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term due to increased liquidity of the underlying options in the post ipo era as compared to our historical grants 
we started using our own historical data to estimate the expected term starting in october expected volatility of our stock is based on the weighted average implied and historical volatility of infinera and our peer group 
the peer group is comprised of similar companies in the same industrial sector 
as we gain more historical volatility data  the weighting of our own data in the expected volatility calculation associated with options will gradually increase 
we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp using the black scholes option pricing formula 
our espp typically provides for consecutive six month offering periods  except for the first such offering period which commenced on june  and ended on february  we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares 
we accounted for the fair value of restricted stock units rsus using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for new hire grants  rsus typically vest ratably on an annual basis over four years 
for annual refresh grants  rsus typically vest ratably on an annual basis over three  four or five years 
in  we granted retention rsus to executives which cliff vest after an approximate two year period and to other employees which vest ratably on a monthly basis over one or two years 
we estimate the fair value of performance share units psus granted using the monte carlo simulation model 
we issued psus in as part of our annual refresh grant process 
the psus entitle our executive officers and members of our board of directors to receive a number of shares of our common stock based on our stock price performance over a three year or four year period as compared to the nasdaq composite index nasdaq for the same period 
the psus cliff vest after three or four years and the number of shares to be issued upon vesting ranges from to times the number of psus granted depending on the relative performance of our common stock price compared to nasdaq 
this performance metric is classified as a market condition 
the monte carlo simulation model is based on a discounted cash flow approach  with the simulation of a large number of possible company and nasdaq stock price outcomes 
the use of the monte carlo simulation model requires the input of a number of assumptions including expected volatility of our stock price  expected volatility of nasdaq  correlation between changes in our stock price and changes in nasdaq  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
expected volatility of our stock is based on the weighted average implied and historical volatility of our peer group in the industry in which we do business 
expected volatility of nasdaq is based on the historical and implied data 
correlation is based on the historical relationship between our peer group stock price and nasdaq composite average 
the risk free interest rate is based upon the treasury zero coupon yield appropriate for the term of the psu as of the grant date 
the expected dividend yield is zero for us as we do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
the expected dividend yield for nasdaq is the annual dividend yield expressed as a percentage of the composite average of nasdaq on the grant date 
inventory valuation inventories  net consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost first in  first out method or market 
market value is based upon an estimated selling price reduced by the estimated cost of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimated average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract price  future demand and pricing and technological obsolescence of our products 

table of contents inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand or is anticipated to be sold at a loss is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
as of december  and december   our inventory value had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolescence 
in valuing our deferred inventory costs  we considered whether the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered at less than cost  primarily comprised of common equipment  had declined 
we concluded that  in the instances where the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered was less than cost  it was appropriate to value the inventory costs and deferred inventory costs at cost or market  whichever is lower  thereby recognizing the cost of the reduction in utility in the period in which the reduction occurred or can be reasonably estimated 
we have  therefore  recognized inventory write downs as necessary in each period in order to reflect common equipment inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as of december  and december   our inventory value had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for lcm adjustments 
we considered whether we should accrue losses on firm purchase commitments related to inventory items 
given that the expected selling price of common equipment in the future remains below cost  we have also recorded losses on these firm purchase commitments in the period in which the commitment is made 
when the inventory parts related to these firm purchase commitments are received  that inventory is recorded at the purchase price less the accrual for the loss on the purchase commitment 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
as of december  and december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was zero and million  respectively  associated with accounts receivable deemed uncollectible relating to one customer 
in  we recorded a recovery of this doubtful account for million 
accrued warranty we warrant that our products will operate substantially in conformity with product specifications 
upon delivery of our products  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products or the related components that may be returned under warranty 
our hardware warranty periods range from to years from date of acceptance for hardware and days to months for software warranty 
the hardware warranty accrual is based on actual historical returns experience and the application of those historical return rates to our in warranty installed base 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
we have software warranty support obligations to a small number of our customers and the costs associated with providing these software warranties have been immaterial to our consolidated financial statements to date 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments we consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of days or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
marketable securities consist principally of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agency notes  us treasuries  auction rate securities ars and put rights 
we consider all debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and remaining time to maturity of one year or less to be short term investments 
we classify debt instruments with remaining maturities greater than one year as long term investments  unless we intend to settle our holdings within one year or less and in such case it is considered to be short term investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of our marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
available for sale investments are stated at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate our available for sale marketable debt securities for other than temporary impairments as discussed below and record any credit loss portion in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and for any credit losses incurred on these securities 
gains and losses are recognized when realized in the consolidated statements of operations under the specific identification method 
trading securities investments are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations  consisting of ars trading securities and related put rights 

table of contents fair value measurement of investments the fair value of our financial instruments reflects the estimates of amounts that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the fair value estimates presented in our consolidated financial statements are based on information available to us as of december  we apply a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs as follows level i quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level ii inputs other than level i that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
in addition  level ii could include unobservable inputs that are not significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level iii unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we measure our cash equivalents  debt securities and put rights at fair value and classify our securities in accordance with a fair value hierarchy 
our money market funds and us treasuries are classified within level i of the fair value hierarchy and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
we classify our certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds and us agency notes within level ii of the fair value hierarchy as follows certificates of deposit we review market pricing and other observable market inputs for the same or similar securities obtained from a number of industry standard data providers 
in the event that a transaction is observed for the same or similar security in the marketplace  the price on that transaction reflects the market price and fair value on that day 
in the absence of any observable market transactions for a particular security  the fair market value at period end would be equal to the par value 
these inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data  and result in the classification of these securities as level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
commercial paper we review market pricing and other observable market inputs for the same or similar securities obtained from a number of industry standard data providers 
in the event that a transaction is observed for the same or similar security in the marketplace  the price on that transaction reflects the market price and fair value on that day and then follows a revised accretion schedule to determine the fair market value at period end 
in the absence of any observable market transactions for a particular security  the fair market value at period end is derived by accreting from the last observable market price 
these inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data accreted mathematically to par  and result in the classification of these securities as level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
corporate bonds we review trading activity and pricing for each of the corporate bond securities in our portfolio as of the measurement date and determine if pricing data of sufficient frequency and volume in an active market exists in order to support level i classification of these securities 
since sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available  we obtain market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities from a number of industry standard data providers 
in instances where multiple prices exist for similar securities  these prices are used as inputs into a distribution curve to determine the fair market value at period end 
as a result  we classify our corporate bonds as level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
us agency notes we review trading activity and pricing for our us agency notes as of the measurement date 
when sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available  we use market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from a number of industry standard data providers 
these inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data  and result in the classification of these securities as level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents we classify our ars and related put rights within level iii of the fair value hierarchy as follows auction rate securities our ars are classified within level iii because they are valued  in part  by using inputs that are unobservable in the market and are significant to the valuation 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our ars and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
in light of these developments  to determine the fair value for our ars  we used a combination of the market approach and income approach 
the market approach uses pricing based on transactions in an inactive secondary market for similar or comparable securities 
in addition  we performed our own discounted cash flow analysis 
management determined that it was most appropriate to value the ars using the market approach and income approach equally given the facts and circumstances as of december   and therefore incorporated both valuations in our fair value measurement 
the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our ars  as of december   are as follows contractual cash flow the model assumed that the principal amount or par value for these securities will be repaid at the end of the estimated workout period 
in addition  future interest payments were estimated as described in each individual prospectus and based on the then current us treasury bill t bill rate adjusted for a failed auction premium of basis points bps for all our ars  except for bps for a rated securities 
ars discount rate the model incorporated a discount rate equal to an estimate of the libor rates commensurate with the estimated workout period of the securities 
as of the measurement date  these rates were then adjusted by a total of approximately bps to bps which included an estimate of the market student loan spread and a discount factor to reflect the lack of liquidity and the credit risk of the securities 
most of our ars were aaa rated  except for million par value of our ars that were downgraded to a rating and million par value of ars that were downgraded to aa rating during our ars are mostly collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
the discount rate does  however  include a discount factor to reflect the issuer s credit risk and its potential inability to perform its obligations under the terms of the ars agreements 
our other than temporary impairment analysis for two of our available for sale ars indicates that the estimated credit risk element included in the discount rate for an aaa rated security is approximately bps and bps for an a rated security 
estimated maturity we estimated the workout period of our ars as the weighted average life of the underlying trust loan portfolio where this information was available from servicing and other trust reports 
in a small number of instances where this information was not available  we used the weighted average life of the loan portfolio of a similar trust 
the estimated time to maturity of the securities as of the measurement date ranged from years to years 
put rights put rights associated with our ars holdings with ubs financial services  inc ubs are classified as level iii because they are valued  in part  by using inputs that are unobservable in the market and are significant to the valuation 
the fair value of the put rights is equal to the difference between the fair value of the ubs ars calculated as described above and their value including the impact of the put rights 
we performed our own discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the fair value of the ubs ars including the impact of the put rights 
the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the ubs ars including the impact of the put rights as of december  are as follows contractual cash flow the model assumed that the principal amount or par value for the ars would be repaid on june   based on our current intent to exercise our put rights and sell these securities to ubs on that date 
in addition  future interest payments were estimated as described in each individual prospectus and based on the then current t bill rate as adjusted for a failed auction premium of bps for all of our ars  except for bps for a rated securities 

table of contents discount rate the model incorporated a discount rate equal to an estimate of the libor rates commensurate with the expected sale date of these securities 
as of the measurement date  this rate was adjusted by approximately bps which represented a discount factor to reflect ubs credit risk and ubs potential inability to perform its obligations under the put rights agreement 
we believe that the fair value of our ars and put rights could change significantly in the future  based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the financial markets 
ubs credit risk may be subject to significant volatility and it is difficult to predict future fluctuations 
a deterioration in ubs credit risk would result in an immaterial amount of loss in our consolidated statements of operations for deterioration in the ars discount rate or a change in the estimated time to maturity would have no impact on our consolidated statements of operations because a change in fair value of the ars would be offset by a change in fair value of the put rights 
other than temporary impairments we review our available for sale marketable debt securities on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not a security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if a debt security s market value is below amortized cost and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before our anticipated recovery  we record an other than temporary impairment otti charge to earnings for the entire amount of the impairment 
when we do not intend to sell an impaired security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  we separate the otti into credit and non credit loss portions 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in other income expense  net  and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in determining if a credit loss has occurred  it is our policy to isolate the credit loss related portion of the discount rate used to derive the fair market value of the security and apply this to the expected cash flows in order to determine the portion of the otti that is credit loss related 
this credit related portion of the discount rate is based on the financial condition of the issuer  changes in rating agency credit ratings for the security or increases in credit related yield spreads on similar securities offered by the same issuer 
once a credit impairment loss has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  the amortized cost basis of that available for sale security is reduced by the amount of the credit impairment loss  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
any non credit related unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
we will continue to monitor the security s credit rating and credit spread and will accrete any reduction in the credit impairment loss to interest income over the expected life of the security 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable future periods 
we must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions  and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   certain of our domestic net deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income  by jurisdiction  based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

table of contents total product revenue decreased to million in from million in primarily due to decreased purchases of our dtn system by existing customers  however  this impact was partially offset by the addition of new domestic and international customers and new deployments with certain existing customers 
total ratable revenue decreased to million in from million in the majority of the ratable revenue recognized in related to deferred revenue from the periods prior to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services 
excluding this impact  ratable revenue for would have been million related to new ratable revenue generated from bundled sales made in the period 
total services revenue increased to million in from million in  reflecting an increase in software subscription revenue from million in to million in and an increase in other non installation related services revenue from million in to million in compared to total revenue in was million as compared to million in however  as explained above  prior to december   we had not attained vsoe of fair value for most of our services and were required to recognize much of our revenue ratably over the relevant service period 
this requirement resulted in the deferral of million of revenue related to invoiced shipments 
this deferral was subsequently recognized as revenue in and included other deferrals from prior periods 
revenues for and  excluding the impacts of vsoe related deferrals  would have been million and million in and respectively 
this year over year increase was primarily due to increased purchases of our dtn system by existing customers and the addition of new customers 
our customer base increased from customers at the end of to at the end of in addition  international revenue increased from in to in as we experienced increased levels of sales to international customers during total product revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to the attainment of vsoe on software subscription services and training and installation and deployment services in this resulted in the classification of increased levels of sales as product revenue during the year 
total ratable revenue decreased to million in from million in this reflects an increase in the upfront recognition of product revenue following the attainment of vsoe on software subscription services and training and installation and deployment services in of the million of ratable revenue recognized in  the majority related to deferred revenue from periods prior to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services and only million related to new ratable revenue generated from sales in the year 
total services revenue was million in  reflecting the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services during the year resulting in revenue for these services being disclosed separately

excluding this prior period impact  gross margin for would have been compared to gross margin of in this significant decline in gross margins in as compared to adjusted gross margins in was partially due to lower sales of our higher margin tam and dlm products in the first half of the year and the recognition of revenue related to a number of large lower margin common equipment deployments with new and existing customers in gross margins for also included restructuring and other related costs of million related to the closure of our maryland based semiconductor fab announced in july compared to gross margins in were as compared to in however  prior to december   we had not attained vsoe of fair value for most of our services and were required to recognize much of our revenue ratably over the longest undelivered service period 
this requirement resulted in the deferral of million of revenue and million of gross profit related to invoiced shipments

other gain loss net for included million loss due to a decrease in the fair value of the put rights offset by a million unrealized holding gain to ars trading securities 
additionally  we recorded million of unrealized and realized losses due to foreign currency exchange re measurement and million gain on asset sales in compared to interest income increased in from due to higher invested balances resulting from the funds raised in our ipo and secondary offerings being invested for a full year for offset by the impact of declining interest rates due to global market conditions 
the decrease in interest expense from to was due to the repayment of our outstanding debt following our ipo 

table of contents other loss for included million gain on asset sales  a gross unrealized loss of million related to our ars trading securities offset by a gain of million related to the associated put rights

income tax provision benefit during  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million for a reversal of the federal and state tax provision  following a favorable ruling by the internal revenue service in the third quarter of exclusive of this one time benefit  we recognized income tax expense of approximately million  on pre tax book losses of million for exclusive of the one time benefit mentioned above  the resulting effective tax rate of for differs from the expected statutory rate of based upon unbenefited us losses  non deductible stock compensation charges and foreign taxes provided on foreign subsidiary earnings  offset by the benefit related to refundable research and development tax credits 
this compares to an effective tax rate of approximately for  which reflects tax benefits arising from the release of certain valuation allowances on domestic tax attribute carryforwards which was partially offset by the impact of certain non deductible stock compensation charges  federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based upon our cumulative loss incurred since inception 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire beginning in if not utilized 
as of december   we also have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards noted above and related to excess stock option deductions is approximately million for federal tax purposes 
when the excess stock option deductions are used to offset future taxable income  these estimated tax benefits of approximately million will result in a credit to stockholders equity 
additionally  we have federal and california research and development tax credits available to reduce future income tax expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year if not utilized  while the california research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience an ownership change that may occur  for example  by a change in significant shareholder allocation or equity structure 
based upon our analysis performed  we have determined that an ownership change has occurred  however  the resulting limitation is not significant enough to cause our tax loss and credit carryforwards to expire unutilized 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal  state and international operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
the assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with our income forecasts used to manage our business 
we intend to maintain the remaining valuation allowance until sufficient further positive evidence exists to support a reversal of  or decrease  in the existing valuation allowance

in comparison  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term and long term investments and million in short term and long term restricted cash 
cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and short term and long term restricted cash consist generally of highly liquid investments in certificates of deposits  money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agency notes and us treasuries 
additionally  short term and long term investments also include million par value of ars which are illiquid  of which million par value are included in short term investments due to their related put rights 
the put rights allow us to sell the securities back to ubs at par value at any time during a two year period beginning june  it is our intention to exercise these put rights and liquidate the ars on june  no agreement has been reached to sell the remaining million par value of available for sale ars back to the broker 
it is therefore unclear how long before these securities become liquid and whether we can recover their full par value 
the restricted cash balance amounts are pledged as collateral for certain stand by and commercial letters of credit 
our historical revenue and profitability trends have been significantly impacted by our revenue recognition policy and the timing of our attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services 
prior to the first quarter of  revenue from bundled product sales was deferred and recognized ratably over a period of approximately one year 
this resulted in the accumulation of million of deferred revenue  million of associated deferred inventory costs and million of gross margin on the balance sheet as of december  we recognized million of this deferred revenue and million of associated deferred inventory costs in  but the cash flow impact of these transactions was recorded in and when the transactions occurred and payments were made  not when the majority of the revenue was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in this resulted in a cash flow trend that was driven primarily by the timing and profitability of our underlying invoiced shipments rather than the timing of the recognition of revenue and gross margin from these transactions in our consolidated statements of operations 
this disconnect between the timing of revenue recognition and the underlying cash collections resulted in higher levels of cash from operations experienced in when the net loss in our consolidated statements of operations amounted to million as compared to when net income amounted to million 
we expect our future product revenues and gross margins to more closely approximate our invoiced shipment results with no further significant releases of deferred amounts from prior periods and therefore also expect cash flow trends that are more consistent with the timing of when revenue and gross profits are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents operating activities we experienced negative cash flows from operations of million in we generated a net loss for the period of million and we had non cash charges of million consisting primarily of stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million  restructuring and other related costs of million  offset by million recovery of doubtful accounts 
we also had million of net credit impairment loss and million decrease in the fair value of the put rights offset by million unrealized holding gain from ars trading securities 
accrued liabilities increased by million primarily due to increases in compensation accruals of million related to timing of payroll payments and an increase in management bonuses and sales commissions at the end of in addition  included in the increase in accrued liabilities is a million increase in deferred tax liabilities which is offset by a corresponding increase in long term deferred tax assets included in other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the remainder of the increase in accrued liabilities related to accruals for outside services incurred at the end of the year 
these favorable changes in working capital were offset by an increase in inventories of million related to increased levels of inventory awaiting customer acceptance at customer sites and increased service depot inventory required to support new service contracts sold during the year 
in addition  deferred inventory costs increased by million primarily due to a number of sales contracts where the earnings process was not complete at the end of we generated positive cash flows from operations of million in we generated net income for the period of million  however  it reflected reductions in deferred revenue of million offset by reductions in deferred inventory costs of million 
we had total non cash charges of million consisting primarily of stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million  provision for doubtful accounts of million and million loss reflecting the net impact of the gross unrealized loss of million related to our ars trading securities offset by a million unrealized gain on the associated put rights 
these charges were primarily offset by a gain on disposal of fixed assets of million and investment discount accretion of million 
accounts receivable increased by million primarily due to delays in customer payments and a number of customers deciding not to take early pay discounts in the period 
this was offset by an increase in accounts payable of million reflecting longer payment terms received from key suppliers at the end of the year 
accrued liabilities and other expenses increased by million due to the timing of payments made during the period 
we generated positive cash flows from operations of million in we generated a net loss for the period of million  and we had non cash charges of million consisting primarily of warrant revaluation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition  the net loss reflects an increase in deferred revenue of million and in deferred inventory costs of million 
we experienced improved collections in the period offset by reductions in accounts payable terms 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million primarily due to the purchase of available for sale investments of million and additions to property  plant and equipment for the period of million

net cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily consisting of net proceeds from the purchase  maturity and sale of investments in the period of million  reflecting the transfer of funds from corporate bonds  agency notes and commercial paper to money market funds during the period

cash used in investing activities was million in primarily consisting of million of purchases of investments  reflecting the investment of cash raised from our ipo and follow on offering in june and november  respectively 
additions to property  plant and equipment amounted to million 
these investing activities were offset by million of proceeds from maturities and sales of investments  million of proceeds from the disposal of assets and million change in restricted cash 
financing activities net proceeds from financing activities in were million primarily due to million proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and other equity plans partially offset by million reduction of tax benefit from stock option transactions 

table of contents net proceeds from financing activities in were million due to million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp and other equity plans and million related to excess tax benefit from stock option transactions 
net proceeds from financing activities in were million 
we completed our ipo in june and generated net proceeds of million 
subsequently  in november  we completed our follow on offering and generated net proceeds of million 
we paid off million of our outstanding debt  including million which we had borrowed under an existing facility in the first quarter of in addition  we received million from employee stock options exercised in the period 
auction rate securities as of december   we held million par value of investments comprised of ars  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through auctions that are typically held every  or days 
these securities have historically traded at par and were callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
since february  most of the auctions for these securities have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment in the near term is limited 
additionally  we may not be able to fully recover the par value of its ars or  it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize our investment 
as of december   most of the ars we held were aaa rated  except for million par value of our ars that were downgraded to a rating and million par value of ars that were downgraded to aa rating during our ars were mostly collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
during  million of ars par value were called at par value 
the ars of million par value covered by the ubs settlement and the related put rights are revalued to fair value on a quarterly basis 
we recorded million of unrealized holding gains on our ars trading securities in in other gain loss  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded a decrease of million in the fair value of the put rights in in other gain loss  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we held million par value of available for sale ars held with two issuers  one of which is aaa rated and the other one is a rated 
as of december  we determined that we do not intend to sell these securities and do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their par value 
however  given that the present value of the expected cash flows for these securities was below their par value  a cumulative otti of million  equal to the difference between the fair value and the par value has occurred 
we recognized credit impairment losses of million in our consolidated statements of operations for the non credit related portion of this otti of million was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the ars but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
we do not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in our ars  even for an extended period of time  will affect our ability to finance our operations  including our continued investments in research and development and planned capital expenditures 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
our trading ars  which are subject to the ubs put rights have been classified as short term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as we intend to sell these securities back to ubs at par value on june  our available for sale ars investments are classified as non current assets until we have better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored 
liquidity in the next twelve months  capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million  primarily for product development and manufacturing expansion and upgrades 
in addition  we have experienced a lack of liquidity related to million par value of our ars as described above 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments  excluding our ars  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond months  we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations  respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or otherwise 
we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands purchase obligations operating leases total contractual obligations we have service agreements with our major production suppliers under which we are committed to purchase certain parts 
tax liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions are not included in the table because we are unable to determine the timing of settlement if any  of these future payments with a reasonably reliable estimate

recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting standards that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do incur some immaterial operating costs in other currencies 
in addition  certain of our sales contracts are priced in euros and  therefore  a portion of our revenue is subject to foreign currency risks 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the india rupee  chinese yuan  british pound and the euro 
the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated transactions as of december  and december  would result in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
beginning in the second quarter of  we established a foreign currency risk management program to help protect against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on accounts receivable denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
as a result  we do not expect a significant impact to our results from a change in exchange rates on foreign denominated accounts receivable balances in the near term 
fluctuations in our currency exchange rates could impact our business in the future 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and short term and long term restricted cash totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in certificates of deposit  money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agency notes  us treasuries  and ars and the associated put rights 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates fell by in and  our interest income would have declined approximately million and million  respectively  assuming consistent investment levels

auction rate securities and put rights as of december   we held million par value of investments comprised of ars marketable securities  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through auctions that are typically held every  or days

as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment in the near term is limited 
additionally  we may not be able to fully recover the par value of our ars or it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize our investment 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  a secondary market develops or the securities are redeemed by the broker dealer 
in october  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  one of our brokers  which provides us with put rights to sell back ubs million of our ars portfolio at par value as of december   at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars call right 
ubs has agreed to pay us the par value of our ars within one day of settlement of any call right transaction 
we elected to treat this portion of our ars portfolio as trading securities and measure the put rights at fair value in order to match the changes in the fair value of the ars 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million related to the put rights provided by the settlement and a gross unrealized loss of million on the million par value portion of our ars portfolio as of december  which we did not intend to hold until final maturity because of the opportunity provided by the put rights 
the ars and put rights are revalued to fair market value on a quarterly basis until the sale of these securities has been completed 
as of december   million par value of ubs ars were recorded at fair value of million  with an unrealized loss of million 
these trading ars were classified as short term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  as we intend to sell these securities back to ubs at par value on june  the related put rights had a fair value of million and were also classified as short term investments at december  we recorded million of unrealized holding gains related to ars trading securities in in other gain loss  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for  we recorded a decrease of million in the fair value of the put rights in other gain loss  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of our investment in these securities could change significantly in the future  based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the financial markets

we believe that the fair value of our ars  put rights and otti could change significantly in the future  based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the financial markets 
ubs credit risk may be subject to significant volatility and it is difficult to predict future fluctuations 
a deterioration in ubs credit risk would result in an immaterial amount of loss in our consolidated statements of operations for deterioration in the ars discount rate or a change in the estimated time to maturity would have no impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
a deterioration in the ars student loan credit spread would result in million of additional otti credit loss in our consolidated statements of operations for
