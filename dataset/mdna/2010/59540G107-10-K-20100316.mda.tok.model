sources of funds the bank primarily uses deposits and borrowings to finance lending and investment activities 
borrowing sources include advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  reverse repurchase agreements with investment banks and overnight borrowings from the bank s customers and correspondent bank 
all borrowings  except for the line of credit with the bank s correspondent bank  require collateral in the form of loans or securities 
collateral levels therefore  limit borrowings and the available lines of credit extended by the bank s creditors 
as a result  deposits remain key to the future funding and growth of the business 
deposit growth within the banking industry has been subject to strong competition from a variety of financial services companies 
this competition may require financial institutions to adjust their product offerings and pricing to adequately grow deposits 
competition the banking business is highly competitive  and the profitability of mid penn depends principally upon the bank s ability to compete in its market area 
the bank actively competes with other financial services companies for deposit and loan business 
competitors include other commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  insurance companies  securities brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  and money market funds 
financial institutions compete primarily on the quality of services rendered  interest rates on loans and deposits  service charges  the convenience of banking facilities  location and hours of operation and  in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers  relative lending limits 
many competitors are significantly larger than the bank and have significantly greater financial resources  personnel and locations from which to conduct business 
in addition  the bank is subject to banking regulations while certain competitors may not be 
there are relatively few barriers for companies wanting to enter into the financial services industry

mid penn has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing technology and customer service  including local decision making on loans  establishing long term customer relationships and building customer loyalty  and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers 
the gramm leach bliley act see discussion below  which breaks down many barriers between the banking  securities and insurance industries  may significantly affect the competitive environment in which mid penn operates 
the growth of mutual funds over the past decade has made it increasingly difficult for financial institutions to attract deposits 
the continued flow of cash into mutual funds  much of which is made through tax deferred investment vehicles such as k plans  and a generally strong economy  have  until recently  fueled high returns for these investments  in particular  certain equity funds 
the recent economic turmoil has negatively impacted the returns on many of these investments and impacted the manner in which investors distribute their funds across investment alternatives 
the safety of traditional bank products has recently become an attractive option during this period of market volatility 
mid penn s ability to attract funds in the future will be impacted by the public s appetite for the safety of insured or local investments versus the returns offered by alternative choices as part of their personal investment mix 
mid penn s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in central pennsylvania  especially in dauphin  lower northumberland  western schuylkill and eastern cumberland counties  which mid penn defines as our primary market 
the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation  recession  unemployment  real estate values  trends in the national and global economics  and other factors beyond our control 
an economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in the central pennsylvania area could cause an increase in the level of the bank s non performing assets and loan and lease losses  thereby causing operating losses  impairing liquidity and eroding capital 
mid penn cannot assure you that adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on mid penn s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows

prompt corrective action in addition to the required minimum capital levels described above  federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective actions which federal banking agencies are required to take  and certain actions which they have discretion to take  based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls 
regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution  which is not adequately capitalized 
under the rules  an institution will be deemed to be adequately capitalized if it exceeds the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements 
however  it will be deemed undercapitalized if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than the prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan  along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party

if an institution is deemed critically undercapitalized and continues in that category for four quarters  the statute requires  with certain narrowly limited exceptions  that the institution be placed in receivership 
deposit insurance the fdic insures deposits of the bank through the deposit insurance fund dif 
the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium 
the amount each institution is assessed is based upon a variety of factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund 
the fdic recently increased the amount of deposits it insures from  to  this increase is temporary and will continue through december  the bank pays an insurance premium into the dif based on the quarterly average daily deposit liabilities net of certain exclusions 
the fdic uses a risk based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the dif 
the fdic places each institution in one of four risk categories using a two step process based first on capital ratios the capital group assignment and then on other relevant information the supervisory group assignment 
subsequently  the rate for each institution within a risk category may be adjusted depending upon different factors that either enhance or reduce the risk the institution poses to the dif  including the unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits related to each institution 
finally  certain risk multipliers may be applied to the adjusted assessment 
in  the fdic increased the amount assessed from financial institutions by increasing its risk based deposit insurance assessment scale 
the quarterly annualized assessment scale for ranged from twelve basis points of assessable deposits for the strongest institutions to basis points for the weakest 
in  the fdic also adopted a uniform special assessment rate for all institutions not to exceed basis points on the individual bank s assessment base 
the total amount paid by the bank for fdic insurance for the year ended december  under these provisions was  on november   the fdic approved a rule to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and an insured institution s risk based deposit insurance assessments will continue to be calculated on a quarterly basis  but will be paid from the amount the institution prepaid until the later of the date that amount is exhausted or june   at which point any remaining funds would be returned to the insured institution 
consequently  mid penn s prepayment of dif premiums made in december resulted in a prepaid asset of  environmental laws management does not anticipate that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have any material effect on mid penn s capital  expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
however  environmentally related hazards have become a source of high risk and potentially unlimited liability for financial institutions 
in  the pennsylvania general assembly enacted the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act  which among other things  provides protection to lenders from environmental liability and remediation costs under the environmental laws for releases and contamination caused by others 
a lender who engages in activities involved in the routine practices of commercial lending  including  but not limited to  the providing of financial services  holding of security interests  workout practices  foreclosure or the recovery of funds from the sale of property shall not be liable under the environmental acts or common law equivalents to the pennsylvania department of environmental resources or to any other person by virtue of the fact that the lender engages in such commercial lending practice 
a lender  however  will be liable if it  its employees or agents  directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of regulated substance on or from the property  or known and willfully compelled the borrower to commit an action which caused such release or violate an environmental act 
the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act does not limit federal liability which still exists under certain circumstances

mid penn s and the bank s business is also affected by the state of the financial services industry in general 
as a result of legal and industry changes  management believes that the industry will continue to experience an increased rate of change as the financial services industry strives for greater product offerings  market share and economies of scale

mid penn s earnings are  and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had  and will likely continue to have  an impact on the operating results of commercial banks because of the federal reserve s power to implement national monetary policy to  among other things  curb inflation or combat recession 
the federal reserve has a major impact on the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  various types of federal and state legislation have been proposed that could result in additional regulation of  and restrictions on  the business of mid penn and the bank 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the united states

risk factors future dividend payments and common stock repurchases are restricted by the terms of the us treasury s equity investment in mid penn under the terms of the cpp  for so long as any preferred stock issued under the cpp remains outstanding  mid penn is prohibited from increasing dividends to holders of its common stock above the last per share quarterly amount in effect immediately prior to october  per share  and from making certain repurchases of equity securities  including our common stock  without the us treasury s consent until the third anniversary of the us treasury s investment or until the us treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the cpp to third parties 
as long as the preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities  including mid penn s common stock  are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
mid penn is subject to interest rate risk mid penn s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond mid penn s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest mid penn receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i mid penn s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of mid penn s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of mid penn s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  mid penn s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on mid penn s results of operations 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
mid penn is subject to lending risk as of december   approximately of mid penn s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because mid penn s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations

mid penn s allowance for possible loan and lease losses may be insufficient mid penn maintains an allowance for possible loan and lease losses  which is a reserve established through provisions for possible losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires mid penn to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem credits and other factors  both within and outside of mid penn s control  may require an increase in the allowance 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review mid penn s allowance for possible loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance  mid penn will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect mid penn s profitability mid penn s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating  both commercial and consumer loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of its competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce the corporation s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of mid penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more convenient branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than mid penn  which could decrease the deposits that mid penn attracts or require mid penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect mid penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  mid penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds 
mid penn s banking subsidiary also competes with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations  which may offer more favorable terms 
some of its non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over mid penn s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit mid penn s margins on banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
mid penn s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates mid penn s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of mid penn s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
mid penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary  which is subject to regulatory limits mid penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries 
its ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies 
the ability of mid penn s subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability  financial condition  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
there is no assurance that mid penn s subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that mid penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future 
mid penn s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock

any change in applicable regulations or federal  state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on mid penn and its operations 
additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect mid penn s powers  authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on mid penn s results of operations and financial condition

under these laws  mid penn is required  among other things  to enforce a customer identification program and file currency transaction and suspicious activity reports with the federal government

many of these transactions expose mid penn to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  mid penn s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by mid penn cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to mid penn 
any such losses could have a material adverse affect on the mid penn s financial condition and results of operations

the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements

all written or oral forward looking statements attributable to mid penn are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of mid penn s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation and notes thereto and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
mid penn is not aware of any known trends  events  uncertainties or of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on mid penn s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
financial summary the consolidated earnings of mid penn are derived primarily from the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary  mid penn bank 
mid penn recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of  for the year  compared to net income available to common shareholders of  in  which was a decrease of  or 
this represents a net loss in of per common share compared to net income of per common share in and per common share in total assets of mid penn continued to grow in  reaching the level of  an increase of  or over  at year end the majority of growth came from increases in commercial and commercial real estate loans 
these increases were funded primarily through growth in deposits 
mid penn s return on average shareholders equity  roe  a widely recognized performance indicator in the financial industry  was in  in and in return on average assets roa  another performance indicator  was in  in and in mid penn s performance during was adversely impacted by several factors 
first was an increase in provision for loan and lease losses  driven by deterioration in the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
the recession and problems in the commercial real estate sector of the economy negatively impacted a number of loans in the portfolio  causing a precipitous increase in non performing loans 
mid penn also experienced strong growth in loan volumes 
further discussion of this increase can be found in the provision for loan and lease losses section below 

table of contents mid penn bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis second was the dramatic increase in fdic insurance expense 
this increase of  or over levels resulted primarily from an industry wide assessment by the fdic on all of its member banks to restore the deposit insurance fund to address future bank failures should they occur 
this increase is not a reflection on mid penn s financial performance  but rather on the number of bank failures throughout the country which had depleted the deposit insurance fund 
further discussion of this and other expense increases can be found in the noninterest expense section below 
finally is the decline in interest rate environment that occurred late in and early while mid penn exhibited strong growth in both loans and deposits  the federal reserve s program of interest rate cuts to spur a loosening of the credit markets blunted the benefit of this growth 
mid penn s net interest margin declined to in from in mid penn s net interest margin was also negatively impacted by the interest lost on nonperforming loans and leases 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis rose  or over levels in spite of an increase in average earning assets 
further discussion of net interest margin can be found in the net interest income section below 
mid penn s fundamental operating performance in was sound despite these issues and the general economic conditions and credit crisis issues experienced by the banking industry as a whole 
mid penn s ongoing investment in marketing and business development in and was rewarded with strong growth in loans and deposits in its markets 
the bank s tier one capital to risk weighted assets of  or and total capital to risk weighted assets of  or at december   are above the regulatory requirements  which is for tier one capital and for total capital 
tier one capital consists primarily of the bank s shareholders equity 
total capital includes qualifying subordinated debt  if any  and the allowance for loan and lease losses  within permitted limits 
risk weighted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk to different categories of assets and off balance sheet activities 
critical accounting estimates mid penn s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
management of the corporation considers the accounting judgments relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses and the evaluation of the corporation s investment securities for other than temporary impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
throughout the remainder of this report  the terms loan or loans refers to both loans and leases 
valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  investment valuation is based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and observable yield curves and spreads 
in addition to valuation  management must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of the investments that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of the loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
net interest income net interest income  mid penn s primary source of revenue  represents the difference between interest income and interest expense 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and changes in average balances volume in the various interest sensitive assets and liabilities

the yield on earning assets decreased to in from in the yield on earning assets for was 
the change in the yield on earning assets was due primarily to changes in market interest rates and extreme rate competition within our market 
the average prime rate for was as compared to for and for the yield on earning assets is also negatively impacted by the loss of interest on nonperforming loans 
during  this loss of interest amounted to  had this interest been included in mid penn s earnings  the yield on earning assets would have increased interest expense decreased by  or  in as compared to a decrease of  or  in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in the cost of interest bearing liabilities for was 
the reduction in cost of interest bearing liabilities was due to changes in market interest rates and mid penn s ability to reduce the rates on money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the reduction in market interest rates also had a positive impact on mid penn s cost for short term borrowings 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  influenced by the increase in nonaccrual loans in  was compared to in and in the interest rate impact of earning assets and funding sources due to changes in interest rates can be reasonably estimated at current interest rate levels  the options selected by customers  and the future mix of the loan  investment  and deposit products in the bank s portfolios  may significantly change the estimates used in the simulation models 
in addition  our net interest income may be impacted by further interest rate actions of the federal reserve bank 
management continues to monitor the net interest margin closely

nonaccrual loans are loans on which we no longer recognize daily interest income 
a loan is generally classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest has consistently been in default for a period of days or more  or because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified to lower interest or principal payments because of borrower financial difficulties 
foreclosed assets held for sale include those assets that have been acquired through foreclosure for debts previously contracted  in settlement of debt 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and in the process of collection or repayment and comprise additional risk elements in the loan portfolio 
consumer loans are generally recommended for charge off when they become days delinquent 
all family residential mortgages days or more past due are reviewed by management  and collection decisions are made in light of the analysis of each individual loan

an insignificant delay or shortfall in the amounts of payments would not cause a loan or lease to be considered impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan or lease and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
larger groups of small balance loans  such as residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement 
as discussed in note of these consolidated financial statements  mid penn determines the fair value of impaired loans on a case by case basis based primarily upon the fair value of the underlying collateral using level inputs comprised of customized collateral value discounting analyses 
as of december   the corporation had several unrelated loan relationships  with an aggregate carrying balance of  deemed impaired that have been placed in nonaccrual status 
specific allocations totaling  have been included within the loan loss reserve for these loans 
this pool of impaired loan relationships is comprised of  in real estate secured commercial relationships and  in business relationships 
the bank has specific allocations against the real estate secured pool totaling  of which  is with one large relationship 
the remaining  is spread among nine relationships composed primarily of customers engaged in real estate investment activities 
the group of impaired business relationships with specific allocations is made up of six relationships primarily engaged in various forms of manufacturing and a specific allocation of  has been set aside against these credits 
one large commercial participation loan in this pool has shown exceptional collateral devaluation and is responsible for a specific allocation of  of the total pool attributable to this segment 
two other manufacturing relationships account for an additional  of the specific allocations due to the negative effects of the economy on their businesses and the subsequent collateral devaluation 
management currently believes that the specific reserve is adequate to cover potential future losses related to these relationships 
 of the non accrual loans are also troubled debt restructured loans 
the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established in the form of a provision expense for loan and lease losses and is reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
when loans are deemed to be uncollectible  they are charged off 
management has established a reserve that it believes is adequate for probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
in conjunction with an internal loan review function that operates independently of the lending function  management monitors the loan portfolio to identify risk on a monthly basis so that an appropriate allowance is maintained 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a monthly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses to the board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review 
in making the evaluation  management considers the results of recent regulatory examinations  which typically include a review of the allowance for loan and lease losses an integral part of the examination process 
in establishing the allowance  management evaluates on a quantitative basis individual classified loans and nonaccrual loans  and determines an aggregate reserve for those loans based on that review 
in addition  an allowance for the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio is determined based on historical loss experience within certain components of the portfolio 
these allocations may be modified if current conditions indicate that loan and lease losses may differ from historical experience 

table of contents mid penn bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis in addition  a portion of the allowance is established for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio which have not been identified by the quantitative processes described above 
this determination inherently involves a higher degree of subjectivity  and considers risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in historical loss experience 
these factors include changes in local  regional  and national economic and business conditions affecting the collectability of the portfolio  the values of underlying collateral  and the condition of various market segments 
changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of nonaccrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff as well as the quality of the institution s loan review system 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and the terms of loans generally offered 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
while the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by management for covering estimated losses in the loan and lease portfolio  determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
changes in these estimates may impact the provisions charged to expense in future periods 
management believes  based on information currently available  that the allowance for loan and lease losses of  is adequate as of december  deposits and other funding sources mid penn s primary source of funds is deposits

the detailed computation of the bank s regulatory capital ratios can be found in note of item  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the greater a corporation s capital resources  the more likely it is to meet its cash obligations and absorb unforeseen losses 
too much capital  however  indicates that not enough of the corporation s earnings have been paid to shareholders and the buildup makes it difficult for a corporation to offer a competitive return on the shareholders capital going forward 
for these reasons capital adequacy has been  and will continue to be  of paramount importance 
capital growth is achieved primarily by retaining more earnings than are paid out to shareholders 
shareholders equity decreased in by  or  following an increase in by  or  and an increase of  or in capital was negatively impacted in by the net loss of  and the payment of cash dividends to common shareholders of  capital was positively impacted in by the addition of  from the us treasury s capital purchase program 
the program was designed to provide well capitalized  secure financial institutions with additional capital in order to increase the flow of credit into the economy 
the program details are discussed in the following section 
mid penn s normal intent for dividend payout is to provide quarterly cash returns to shareholders and earnings retention at a level sufficient to finance future growth 
the dividend payout ratio  which represents the percentage of annual net income returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends was for and for during the fourth quarter of  mid penn suspended the quarterly cash dividend consistent with federal reserve board policy that dividend payouts should not exceed net income for the previous four quarters  net of dividends paid during that period 
mid penn presently plans to resume a quarterly cash dividend payment to common shareholders when it is prudent to do so consistent with this federal reserve policy 
in december of  mid penn retired its treasury stock

the corporation entered into an agreement including the securities purchase agreement standard terms the purchase agreement with the united states department of the treasury the treasury pursuant to which the treasury invested  in the corporation under the treasury s capital purchase program the cpp 
under the purchase agreement  the treasury received  shares of series a fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock   liquidation preference  and warrants to purchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the preferred shares are non voting  other than class voting rights on certain matters that could adversely affect the preferred shares 
if dividends on the preferred shares have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly dividend periods or more  whether consecutive or not  the corporation s authorized number of directors will automatically be increased by two  and holders of the preferred stock  voting together with holders of any then outstanding parity stock  will have the right to elect those directors at the corporation s next annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose 
these preferred share directors would be elected annually and serve until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares have been paid 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  the secretary of the treasury shall permit  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency  the corporation to redeem the series a preferred stock 
the corporation may do so without regard to the source of the funds to be used to redeem the series a preferred stock or any minimum waiting period 
if the corporation elects to redeem the series a preferred stock prior to february   and receives approval from the treasury and the board of governors of the federal reserve system  it must redeem at least  of the series a preferred stock 
upon redemption of the series a preferred stock  the secretary of the treasury is required to liquidate the warrants associated with the corporation s participation in the cpp at the current market price

the warrants are immediately exercisable and have a year term 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrants are both subject to anti dilution adjustments

has a value in an amount that is not greater than one third of the total amount of annual compensation of the employee receiving the stock  and iii 
is subject to such other terms and conditions as the secretary of the treasury may determine is in the public interest  a prohibition on any compensation plan that would encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of mid penn to enhance the compensation of any of its employees  and a requirement that mid penn s compensation committee remains entirely independent and meets at least semiannually to discuss and evaluate employee compensation plans in light of an assessment of any risk posed to mid penn from such plans

management s discussion and analysis effects of inflation a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on its financial results depends principally upon mid penn s ability to manage the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  mitigate the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same magnitude as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how mid penn is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net liabilities  as well as the composition of loans  investments and deposits should be considered 
off balance sheet items mid penn makes contractual commitments to extend credit and extends lines of credit  which are subject to mid penn s credit approval and monitoring procedures 
as of december   commitments to extend credit amounted to  as compared to  as of december  mid penn also issues financial standby letters of credit to its customers 
the risk associated with financial standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in loan extensions to customers 
financial standby letters of credit increased to  at december   from  at december  comprehensive loss income comprehensive loss income is a measure of all changes in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net loss income and comprehensive loss income is termed other comprehensive loss income 
for mid penn  other comprehensive loss income consists primarily of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
other comprehensive loss income also includes a pension component in accordance with asc topic comprehensive loss income should not be construed to be a measure of net loss income 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive loss income may vary widely at statement dates depending on the markets as a whole and how interest rate movements affect the market value of the portfolio of available for sale securities 
other comprehensive loss income for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  mid penn s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in mid penn s future earnings earnings at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure or sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of mid penn s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
each asset and liability reprices either at maturity or during the life of the instrument 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in a future period of time 
the principal purpose of asset liability management is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
net interest income is increased by increasing the net interest margin and by volume growth 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an acceptable level 
mid penn utilizes an asset liability management model to measure the impact of interest rate movements on its interest rate sensitivity position 
mid penn s management also reviews the traditional maturity gap analysis regularly 
mid penn does not always attempt to achieve an exact match between interest sensitive assets and liabilities because it believes that an actively managed amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate in the management of the corporation s profitability 
modeling techniques and simulation analysis involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  non maturing deposit sensitivity  and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of mid penn s interest rate risk position over time 
management reviews interest rate risk on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes earnings scenarios whereby interest rates are increased and decreased by   and basis points 
these scenarios  detailed in table  indicate that there would not be a significant variance in net
