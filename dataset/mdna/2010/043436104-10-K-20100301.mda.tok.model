item business we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises at dealership locations as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  new and used vehicle financing  and aftermarket products such as insurance  warranty and service contracts 
asbury automotive group  inc was incorporated in the state of delaware on february   and our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol abg 

table of contents general description of our operations as of december   we operated dealerships in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
we have developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we have complemented these large dealership group acquisitions with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and smaller dealership groups in our then existing market areas 
our retail network consists of nine locally branded dealership groups

b represents pending divestitures as of december  new vehicle sales as of december   we had a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
our new vehicle unit sales consist of the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new light vehicle retail  the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet  and the sale of new heavy trucks heavy truck the terms new light vehicle retail  fleet and heavy truck  being collectively referred to as new 
our new light vehicle revenue and new light vehicle gross profit include revenue and gross profit from new light vehicle unit and fleet unit sales 
in  we sold  new vehicles through our dealerships 
new light vehicle sales were of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  new heavy truck revenue totaled of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our new vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
our new vehicle revenues include new vehicle sale and lease transactions arranged by our dealerships with third parties 
as a result of fixed period lease terms  customers who lease new vehicles generally return to the market more frequently than customers who purchase new vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give our dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by customers at lease end  leases typically provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used 
table of contents vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under manufacturer warranty for the term of the lease  which results in increased parts and services revenue  as dealerships are typically relied upon to provide warranty repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at all of our dealership locations 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being together referred to as used 
in  we sold  used retail vehicles through our dealerships 
sales of used retail vehicles  which generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles  accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
wholesale sales represented of our total revenues  but did not have a material impact on our total gross profit  for the year ended december  gross profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and the use of advanced technology to manage our inventory 
our new vehicle operations typically provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are good sources of attractive used vehicle inventory 
we also purchase a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions that offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
used vehicle inventory is typically sold as wholesale if a vehicle is not sold at retail within days  except for used vehicles that do not fit within our inventory mix  which are sold as wholesale almost immediately 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also creates service work for our parts and service departments 
parts and service we sell parts and provide maintenance and repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
we operate approximately  service bays at our dealerships 
in addition  as of december   we maintained free standing collision repair centers either on the premises of  or in close proximity to  our dealerships 
sales of parts and service accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  historically  parts and service revenues have been more stable than those from vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over time primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increasing number of vehicles on the road 
however  we believe that our parts and service revenues have been  and will continue to be  under pressure in the current challenging retail environment because vehicle owners have been postponing  and may continue to postpone certain repairs that are not necessary to the functional operation of their vehicle 
in addition  we continue to believe that vehicles manufactured in recent years continue to show signs of improved manufacturing  resulting in the need for fewer repairs which  in turn  reduces our parts and services revenues 
furthermore  the significant decline in us vehicle sales over the past two years may have an adverse impact on our parts and service business for the next several years 
the automotive parts and service industry tends to be highly fragmented  with franchised dealerships and independent repair shops competing for this business 
we believe  however  that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles has made it difficult for independent repair shops to compete effectively for our service and repair business 
these independent repair shops may not be able to invest in the equipment and training necessary to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports which comprise a significant majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
our parts and service business also benefits from the service work generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us  as historically these customers have tended to service their vehicles at the same location where they purchase extended warranty contracts 
additionally  vehicle manufacturers require manufacturer warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are authorized to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex vehicles 
for the year ended december   warranty work accounted for of our parts and service revenue 
finance and insurance we refer to the finance and insurance portion of our business as f i 
through our f i business  we arrange for third party financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers  as well as offer a number of aftermarket products such as extended service contracts  guaranteed asset protection gap debt cancellation  prepaid maintenance  credit life and disability insurance  and similar products 
our finance and insurance business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  the following is a brief description of our significant f i product offerings 
table of contents extended service contracts covers certain repair work after the expiration of the manufacturer warranty 
gap debt cancellation covers the difference in value between the actual value of the car and the amount on an auto loan or a lease after the payment from the insurance company at the time of a total loss 
prepaid maintenance covers certain routine maintenance work  such as i oil changes  ii cleaning and adjusting of brakes iii multi point vehicle inspections and iv tire rotations 
credit life and disability covers the remaining amounts due on an auto loan or a lease in the event of death or disability 
we earn sales based commissions on substantially all of the financing that we arrange on behalf of our customers 
we may be charged back chargebacks for these commissions in the event a finance contract is cancelled  typically within the first days of such contract or if a non finance contract is canceled prior to its maturity 
we arranged customer financing on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  these transactions resulted in commissions being paid to us by the third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries 
currently  we do not retain liability for the credit risk associated with these purchase and lease transactions after the completion of the transactions 
similarly  we may be required to refund a portion of our profit relating to the sale of warranty  maintenance and insurance and other products in the event of early cancellation 
we do not  however  bear any risk related to insurance payments  which are borne by third parties 
we receive discounted pricing compared to smaller competitors in our local markets on many of the warranty  maintenance and insurance products that we provide as a result of our size and sales volume 
historically  chargebacks on finance contracts and warranty  maintenance and insurance products have totaled between and of total f i revenue 
we are currently party to a number of preferred lender agreements 
under the terms of these preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission rate for each loan that our dealerships place with that lender 
furthermore  many of the warranty and insurance products we sell result in underwriting profits and investment income for us based on portfolio performance 
the underwriting profits and investment income  if any  represent the amount of funds available to pay future claims in excess of what is actually used to pay claims on the related policies 
these payments are determined by the lenders based upon an agreed upon earnings schedule 
recent developments new sprinter franchises in january  we were awarded two sprinter franchises  which were added to our mercedes benz locations in st 
louis  missouri and tampa  florida 
toyota and lexus recalls on october   toyota initiated a recall for potential floor mat interference with accelerator pedals  referred to as the pedal entrapment recall  currently covering over million toyota and lexus vehicles 
on january   toyota announced a recall for sticking accelerator pedals  referred to as the accelerator pedal recall  currently covering approximately million toyota vehicles 
on january   toyota then temporarily suspended sales of the eight new vehicle models covered by the accelerator pedal recall 
in early february  toyota announced that dealers can resume selling vehicles covered by the accelerator pedal recall  to the extent they perform the necessary repairs to address such recall 
on february   toyota announced additional recalls covering model year prius vehicles as well as other toyota and lexus vehicles 
we currently own i toyota dealerships representing and of our new and used vehicle sales  respectively and of our total revenues for the year ended december   and ii lexus dealerships representing and of our new and used vehicle sales  respectively and of our total revenues for the year ended december  in addition  a significant amount of our toyota vehicle inventory is covered by one or more of these recalls 
while we do not currently project a material impact on our business from the toyota and lexus recalls commenced to date and based on currently available information  the overall impact is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the recalls  or additional recalls that may occur  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our franchise sales into luxury  mid line import  mid line domestic  value  and heavy trucks 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new light vehicle sales for the year ended december  over the last two decades  luxury and mid line imports have gained market share at the expense of mid line domestic brands 
we believe that in this challenging retail environment  luxury brands will maintain a strong presence in the market and that mid line import market share gains will continue  primarily because luxury and mid line import vehicles  based on recent results  have delivered more desirable vehicle models  in terms of fuel efficiency and cost  demonstrated greater resilience to downturns in the economy  garnered higher customer loyalty  and presented more attractive service and used car opportunities 

table of contents the following table reflects i the number of franchises and ii the percent of new light vehicle revenues represented by each class of franchise as of december  class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new light vehicle revenues for the year ended december  light vehicles luxury bmw acura a mercedes benz infiniti lincoln lexus volvo audi cadillac jaguar land rover porsche total luxury mid line import honda a nissan toyota mini mazda volkswagen total mid line import mid line domestic ford mercury chevrolet chrysler dodge buick gmc jeep pontiac total mid line domestic value smart hyundai kia total value total light vehicles 
table of contents class franchise number of franchises as of december  heavy trucks hino international isuzu truck ic bus peterbilt ud truck workhorse total heavy trucks total franchise accounted for less than of new light vehicle retail revenue for the year ended december  a includes one pending divestiture as of december  our physical locations encompassed different metropolitan markets at locations in the following states as of december  arkansas  california  florida  georgia  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  south carolina  texas and virginia 
new vehicle sales revenue is diversified among certain manufacturers as shown in the table above 
we believe that our geographic diversity as well as diversification among manufacturers decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as manufacturer bankruptcy  recalls  warranty issues or production disruption 
see risk factors for a description of several risks relating to manufacturer specific risks 
each of our dealerships maintains a strong local brand that has been enhanced through local advertising 
we believe our cultivation of strong local brands is beneficial because consumers prefer to interact with a locally recognized brand 
by placing franchises in one geographic location under a single  local brand  we believe we will be able to generate advertising synergies and retain customers even if they purchase and service different automobile brands 
maintain flexible cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on controlling expenses at our existing dealerships and any that may be integrated into our operations upon acquisition 
we categorize our cost structure into three groups  which are variable  semi variable and fixed 
variable costs include incentive based compensation  which include commissions and other incentive pay and vehicle carrying cost 
salespeople  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and the majority of other non clerical dealership personnel are paid a commission 
we also compensate our general managers with incentive pay  based on dealership profitability  and our department managers and salespeople are similarly compensated with an incentive based pay system based upon departmental profitability and individual performance 
in addition  the bonus portion of our salaried employees compensation is tied to our overall operating results  and is thus variable 
semi variable expenses include base salaries  outside services  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and loaner vehicle amortization 
fixed costs include rent  utilities and depreciation expense 
we are constantly evaluating our cost structure  and believe that we can further manage our costs by centralizing our processing systems and capitalizing on best practices among our dealerships  standardizing our benefit plans  and negotiating additional contracts with certain of our vendors on a national rather than regional basis 
for example  in order to reduce our expenses  we recently completed a corporate and regional restructuring plan  which included the relocation of our corporate offices and the reorganization of our retail network 
we moved our corporate headquarters to duluth  georgia  and closed our corporate offices in new york  new york and stamford  connecticut  at the end of march in addition  during  we eliminated our regional management structure 
finally  we continue to expand our store level productivity initiatives  focus on managing our cost structure  improve inventory management and select technology investments to enhance our productivity 
for a further discussion of the cost savings resulting from our restructuring and productivity initiatives  please see the discussion in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 

table of contents focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  parts and service  used vehicle retail sales  and finance and insurance generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
as a result  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and dealership levels  who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
while each of our dealership general managers has flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions  including market specific advertising and management of inventory mix  each pursues an integrated strategy  as directed from our centralized management team at our corporate office  to enhance profitability and stimulate organic growth 
local management of dealership operations we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers in which the general managers are responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of their dealerships as well as other day to day operations 
we believe our general managers familiarity with their markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers and recruit new employees 
the general manager of each dealership is supported  in most cases  by a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  a f i manager  and a parts and service manager 
our dealership management teams typically have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
in addition  our continued focus on college recruiting  training  development  and retention is designed to maintain and strengthen our talented management pool 
this management structure is complemented by support from the corporate office through centralized technology and financial controls 
we also believe the application of professional management practices such as the implementation of policies and procedures to streamline processes  create efficiencies and share best practices among our dealership operations provides us with a competitive advantage over many independent dealerships 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we continue to regularly examine our operations in order to identify areas for improvement and disseminate best practices throughout our retail network 
centralized administrative and strategic functions our corporate headquarters is located in duluth  georgia 
the corporate office is responsible for the capital structure of the business and its expansion and operating strategy 
the implementation of our operational strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established and promulgated by the corporate office 
with respect to our growth strategy  the corporate office management team evaluates opportunities for acquisition or to enter new markets as such opportunities become available that we believe will allow us to meet our return threshold 
in addition  we continuously evaluate the financial and operating results of our dealerships  as well as each dealership s geographical location and from time to time  we may seek to sell certain of our dealerships to raise capital or to refine our dealership portfolio 
furthermore  we employ professional management practices in all aspects of our operations 
our dealership operations are complemented by centralized technology and strategic and financial controls  as well as shared market intelligence throughout the organization 
corporate and dealership management utilize centralized management information systems to monitor each dealership s sales  profitability and inventory on a regular basis 
in addition  we have centralized our information technology  payroll and benefits administration from which we expect to experience cost synergies 
beginning in late  we began a migration to a single dealer management system dms  dealertrack s arkona dealer management system 
we believe a single dms will create a more efficient retail operation that will result in a better experience for our customers 
as of december   approximately of our dealerships have been converted to the arkona dealer management system 
we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealerships through customized financial products 
our information technology approach enables us to integrate and aggregate the information from existing dealerships and  when necessary  a new acquisition 
by creating a connection over our private network between the dealer management system and our corporate financial products  management can view the financial  accounting and operational data of any specific dealership 
these financial products allow us to review operating and financial data at a variety of levels 
for example  from our headquarters  management can review the performance of any specific department eg  parts and services at any particular dealership 
this system also allows us to more efficiently compile and monitor our consolidated financial results 

table of contents commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we have designed our dealership service business to meet the needs of our customers and establish relationships that we believe will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we provide our dealership managers with appropriate incentives to employ more efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to meet customer needs 
we continually evaluate opportunities  and implement appropriate new technologies  to improve the buying experience for our customers  and believe that our ability to share best practices across our multi jurisdictional platform gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
for example  our customer relations management tool facilitates communications with our customers before  during and after the sale 
additionally  we have implemented a web based used vehicle inventory management system that allows us to optimize our local market inventory mix and pricing  enabling us to offer a better selection of highly desirable  lower cost used vehicles 
as discussed above  we have invested in innovative computer technologies and developed product menus to help streamline the purchase process and create efficiencies in our customers purchasing experience of our finance  insurance and warranty products 
all of our stores have access to these tools to drive the performance of our employees and enhance customer service 
in addition  our service and repair operations are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty 
we continue to train our technicians and service advisors to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we intend to invest in the human capital necessary to ensure that this aspect of our business continues to expand 
marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
traditionally  we have spent the majority of our advertising dollars on television advertising  but we are experiencing a continued shift toward internet based advertising  including lead generation 
recognizing the fact that customers are using interactive tools to make buying decisions  we are investing in the development of our e commerce strategy by focusing on the development of our brands online  performing research to better understand the online consumer and their decision to visit one site versus another  and reinvesting our marketing dollars toward online marketing 
radio  print  direct mail and the yellow pages make up the remaining factions of our advertising spend 
in addition  we also use electronic mail to assist our marketing efforts and to stay in contact with our customers 
the automotive retail industry has traditionally used locally produced  largely non professional materials for advertising  often developed under the direction of each dealership s general manager 
however  we have chosen to create common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our total company advertising expense from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which translates into an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has historically been a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
competition in new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships  primarily in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from the manufacturers 
instead  we rely on our advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local brand names and location of our dealerships to assist in the sale of new vehicles 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  large used car retail consolidators  independent used car dealers  internet based vehicle brokers and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers and franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are the ability to use factory approved replacement parts  price  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains as well as some competing franchised dealers may offer certain parts and services at prices lower than our prices 

table of contents in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  many financial institutions are now offering f i products through the internet  which may increase competition and reduce our profits on certain of these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 
in addition  given our desire to hire experienced  talented and successful individuals  the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive 
as a result  we also compete with franchised dealers and other large automotive retailers for talented personnel 
dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold and or serviced at the dealership 
a typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services 
each dealer agreement also governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 
the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory or otherwise 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on substantially all aspects of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to  among other things  the following inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  maintenance of minimum net working capital requirements  and in some cases  minimum net worth requirements  achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities and signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems  geographic market  and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose additional requirements to those described above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations  including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  
table of contents limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including sales and customer satisfaction criteria  as well as limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 
some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain circumstances  including upon the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction without the manufacturer s prior consent or a material breach of the framework agreement 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under applicable state laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
provisions for termination or non renewal of dealer and framework agreements 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to eight years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non renewal of the dealer agreements under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
while our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed for any of the reasons listed above  it may be possible to negotiate a waiver of termination or non renewal with the manufacturer 
notwithstanding that  however  no assurances can be provided that upon the termination or attempted termination  or nonrenewal of any agreement  that we will be able to enter into new agreements  or waivers to any agreement  on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry 
under various state laws each of our dealerships must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service in such state 
in addition  we are subject to numerous complex federal  state and local laws regulating the conduct of our business  including with respect to advertising  motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit and deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  
table of contents consumer privacy  money laundering  environmental matters  land use and zoning  and health and safety and employment practices 
we actively make efforts to assure we are in compliance with the laws and related regulations that affect our business 
in certain instances  we are entitled to benefit from the protection of applicable state laws which limit a manufacturer s ability to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement  provide dealers with certain rights with respect to the addition of dealerships within proscribed geographic areas  and protect dealers against manufacturers unreasonably withholding consent to proposed changes in ownership of dealerships 
however  our protection may be limited in some cases under our existing framework agreements with manufacturers  and the laws with respect to these activities may be changed at any time in the future 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or at facilities where we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes  impose liability for the entire cost of a cleanup  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not aware of any material superfund or other remedial liabilities to which we are subject 
further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we are not aware of any non compliance with the wastewater discharge requirements  requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning or other environmental laws applicable to our operations 
environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we experience incidents and encounter conditions that will not be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement change frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
as a result  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
our operations are subject to substantial changes in laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed approximately  people 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
we do not have employees that are represented by a labor union  however  certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
in addition  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes that are outside of our control 
insurance because of the vehicle inventory and the nature of the automotive retail business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we are self insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims 
we have large deductible insurance programs in place for workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating our business 
any of these risks  or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise  any of which could also materially adversely affect us 
we have significant debt  and the ability to incur additional debt  which may limit our flexibility to manage our business 
furthermore  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash  our ability to service our debt may be materially adversely affected 
we have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding i floor plan notes payable  ii the effects of our terminated fair value hedge on our senior subordinated notes due the notes and iii the unamortized discount on our convertible notes due the notes on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries have the ability to obtain additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions  real property purchases  capital expenditures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our bofa revolving credit facility  our jpmorgan used vehicle floor plan facility and the indentures governing our notes and our senior subordinated notes due the notes  as well as certain other agreements 
we will continue to have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 
our significant indebtedness could have important consequences to us  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other corporate purposes  some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to certain risks of interest rate fluctuations  and we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and governmental regulations 
as a result of the foregoing and other potential limitations  our indebtedness obligations may limit our ability to take strategic actions that would otherwise enable us to manage our business  in a manner in which we otherwise would  absent such limitations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents under various agreements to which we are a party  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants 
our failure to comply with certain covenants in our debt  mortgage and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to access our revolving credit facilities and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we have operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our leases and in our debt instruments  including our revolving credit facilities with bank of america  na and jpmorgan chase bank  na  the indentures under our notes and our notes and the mortgage agreements or guarantees for mortgages held with wachovia bank  national association  wachovia financial services  inc  and certain of our other mortgage obligations 
these restrictions and covenants limit  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional debt  to create certain liens or other encumbrances  and to make certain payments including dividends and repurchases of our shares and investments 
our revolving credit facilities  mortgages and or guarantees related to such mortgages  and certain of our lease agreements  require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
as a result of  among other things  the significant changes in our business due to national and global economic uncertainties which began in  in july  we eliminated the total leverage ratio covenants in our revolving credit facilities with bank of america  na and jpmorgan chase bank  na  and the mortgage agreements and guarantees for mortgages held with wachovia bank  national association and wachovia financial services  inc in connection with eliminating these covenants  we agreed to  among other things  significant additional limitations on our ability to incur certain new indebtedness as described in more detail elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we agreed to reduce the total credit availability under our bofa revolving credit facility from million to million 
the additional limitations on new indebtedness  the reduction in total credit availability and the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations if we require additional funds to conduct our business  including funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other corporate purposes 
under the terms of these debt instruments  at our option after april  and assuming we are then in compliance with all applicable requirements therein  we may elect to be governed by the original total leverage ratio covenants  in which case the limitations on additional indebtedness will no longer be applicable 
however  we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to comply with these total leverage ratio covenants at any time in the future 
our failure to satisfy these total leverage ratio covenants would prohibit us from electing to be governed by the original covenants and removing the limitations on additional indebtedness 
we are currently in compliance with all applicable financial and other covenants 
however  our failure to satisfy any of these covenants in the future would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreement  which would i entitle the lenders under such agreement to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreement and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings  ii require us to apply our available cash to repay these borrowings and or iii prevent us from making debt service payments on our notes  our notes  and our senior subordinated convertible notes due the notes 
in many cases  a default under one of our debt agreements could trigger cross default provisions in one or more of our other debt and lease agreements 
if we are unable to comply with applicable financial or other covenants  we may be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders  or we may need to undertake a transaction designed to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt 
obtaining such waivers or modifications often requires the payment to the bank lenders of significant fees and requires significant time and attention of management 
in light of continued uncertain and challenging conditions in the automotive industry and the conditions in the credit markets generally  we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any necessary actions at times  or on terms acceptable to us 
in addition to the financial and other covenants contained in our various financing agreements  a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease 
certain of the leases governing such properties have certain covenants with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our leases  the respective landlords could  among other remedies  terminate the leases and seek damages which could equal the amount to which the accelerated rents under the applicable lease for the remainder of the lease term exceeds the fair market rent over the same period  or evict us from the property 
our failure to comply with any applicable covenants could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
further contraction of the financial markets and asset valuations could negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in the recent past  global financial markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile  and continue to be uncertain 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of certain credit risks and continued weak economic conditions in certain industries and sectors have made it difficult to obtain funding 

table of contents we currently maintain revolving credit facilities with bank of america  na  jpmorgan chase bank  na  and a syndicate of other banks under those credit facilities  and we have hedge transactions in place with wells fargo  na  wachovia financial services  inc  goldman sachs co 
and deutsche bank ag  london branch 
if any of these financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us or have entered into hedge or similar transactions with us are further adversely affected by the current uncertain conditions in the us and international capital markets  they may become unable or unwilling to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us or otherwise fulfill their obligations under the relevant agreements 
furthermore  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased in connection with the uncertain financial markets  as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted more stringent lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
our inability to access necessary or desirable funding  or to enter into certain related transactions  when and at costs deemed appropriate by us could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
if the retail environment continues to be challenging and our dealerships are unable to generate sufficient cash  our liquidity position may be materially adversely affected 
for the last two years  the automotive retail industry has experienced an unprecedented challenging environment  and we expect only a modest recovery to the automotive industry in the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the us  which was over million from to  decreased to approximately million in and million in our operations have been and could continue to be adversely affected by these unfavorable economic conditions 
we also expect continued difficulty for consumers in securing vehicle financing as unemployment remains high and volatility remains in the financial markets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow  we may need to enter into certain extraordinary transactions in order to generate sufficient cash to sustain our operations  which may include  but not be limited to selling certain of our dealerships or other assets and borrowing under our existing credit facilities 
in the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that  if necessary  we will be able to enter into any such transactions in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  if at all 
furthermore  in the event we are required to sell dealership assets to enhance our liquidity  the sale of a material portion of such assets could have an adverse effect on our revenue stream  the size of our operations and certain corporate efficiencies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow or enter into any such transactions in a timely manner  our liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
although we currently have borrowing availability under our credit facilities to finance our operations  our lenders may be unable or unwilling to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us if these lenders face bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale 
the inability to draw cash under our credit facilities due to any of these  or any similar event  facing any one of our lenders would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory and have the ability to finance the purchase of used vehicle inventory using floor plan credit facilities under which we are charged interest at variable rates 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow funds under our various credit facilities at variable interest rates 
therefore  our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates 
in addition  a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because most of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by million 
when considered in connection with reduced expected sales as and if interest rates increase  any such increase could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent vehicle manufacturer bankruptcies and other financial difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
chrysler llc chrysler and general motors corporation gm together  the reorganized manufacturers each emerged from protection under chapter of title of the us bankruptcy code in june in connection with these reorganizations  chrysler terminated the franchise agreement for one of our four chrysler dealerships and gm notified us that it would not renew the franchise agreements for two of our six gm dealerships when they expire in november we closed those two gm dealerships in the third quarter of 
table of contents we have experienced  or may experience  a number of effects on our remaining chrysler and gm dealership operations  including the following as a result of the above actions taken by the reorganized manufacturers a failure of the reorganized manufacturers to supply our dealerships with an adequate number of vehicles  a failure of the reorganized manufacturers to produce desirable vehicles or a delay in the introduction of new or competitive makes or models  a disruption in delivery or availability of parts by the reorganized manufacturers  a reduction or discontinuance by the reorganized manufacturers of incentives  warranties and similar programs intended to promote and support new vehicle sales  a deterioration of the reputation of the reorganized manufacturers products and related decrease in consumer demand for such products  and a disruption in the availability of financing for certain of our new vehicle inventory or consumer credit for the purchase or lease of vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing 
continued operational losses by these  or other vehicle manufacturers  or other similar reorganizations by the reorganized manufacturers or other vehicle manufacturers resulting in the occurrence or reoccurrence of any one or more of the above mentioned events  could have a material adverse effect on our sales volumes and profitability 
in addition  such losses or reorganizations could lead to the impairment of one or more of our franchise rights  inventory  fixed assets and other related assets  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
such losses or reorganizations could also eliminate or reduce the reorganized manufacturers contractual  statutory and common law indemnification obligations to our dealerships 
such elimination or reduction of indemnification obligations could increase our risk particularly in products liability actions by consumers 
adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers of the vehicles that we sell may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our ability to successfully market vehicles to the public depends to a great extent on aspects of our manufacturers operations 
vehicle manufacturers have been  and continue to be  adversely affected by the recent us and global recession 
there has been a significant decline in vehicle sales  and other factors  such as rising interest rates and the tightening of the credit markets  have contributed to a difficult retail environment 
in addition  conditions which negatively affect vehicle manufacturers in any of the following areas could have an adverse effect on their respective revenues and profitability financial condition  marketing efforts  reputation for quality  manufacturer and other product defects  including recalls  management  disruption in manufacturing  importation and distribution  and labor relations 
adverse conditions that materially adversely affect vehicle manufacturers and impact their ability to profitably design  market  produce or distribute new vehicles  could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to sell vehicles produced by that manufacturer  obtain or finance our desired new vehicle inventories  our ability to access or benefit from manufacturer financial assistance programs  our ability to collect in full or on a timely basis any amounts due therefrom  and or our ability to obtain other goods and services provided by the impacted manufacturer 
our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of any event that has a material adverse effect on the vehicle manufacturers or distributors 
in addition  if a vehicle manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  among other things  i the manufacturer could seek to terminate or reject all or certain of our franchises  ii if the manufacturer is successful in terminating all or certain of our franchises  we may not receive adequate compensation for them  iii our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory may increase or no longer be available from such manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary  iv consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be materially adversely affected  especially if costs related to improving such manufacturer s poor financial condition are imputed to the price of its products  v there may be a significant disruption in the availability of consumer credit to purchase or lease vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing  which may negatively impact our sales  and vi there may be a reduction in the value of receivables and inventory associated with that manufacturer 
the occurrence of any one or more of the above mentioned events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on acceptable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries and or is authorized to service  and we operate under additional framework agreements for some vehicle manufacturers  which contain additional requirements that govern the particular vehicle manufacturer s franchises 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  service vehicles  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under these agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer  framework and related agreements and our dependence on the rights  granted by the manufacturers  the manufacturers have the right to exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations  and the terms of these agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed by manufacturers for a number of reasons  and many of the manufacturers have the right to direct us to divest our dealerships if there is a default under the franchise agreement  an unapproved change of control  or certain other unapproved events 
although we currently have certain dealer agreements that will expire during  and we expect that these agreements will be renewed  there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these agreements on a timely basis or that we will be able to obtain renewals on acceptable terms 
most of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with a right of first refusal to purchase any of the manufacturer s franchises we seek to sell 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our rights become compromised or our operations are restricted due to the terms of our dealer agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant percentage of our revenues 
if we fail to comply with the financial covenants contained in certain of our framework agreements  the manufacturers who are parties to such agreements may terminate these agreements and require us to divest such dealerships  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of our agreements with manufacturers require us to meet specified financial ratios 
our failure to comply with such ratios gives the manufacturer certain rights  including the right to reject proposed acquisitions  and may give them the right to repurchase their franchises from us 
our inability to acquire additional dealerships or the requirement that we sell one or more of our dealerships at any time could inhibit the growth of our business  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to meet consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance requirements specified by manufacturers may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indices csi 
the use of csi ratings by manufacturers is in addition to their right to monitor the financial and sales performance of our dealerships 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealer or framework agreement  manufacturers will often establish sales or performance criteria for that dealership 
in accordance with the terms of these agreements  these criteria have been modified by various manufacturers from time to time in the past  and we cannot assure you that they will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time meeting these criteria in the past 
we cannot assure you that any of our dealerships will be able to comply with these criteria in the future 
in accordance with the terms of an applicable framework agreement  a manufacturer may use these criteria as factors in evaluating any application we may make for acquisitions of additional dealerships 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance criteria 
this would impede our ability to execute acquisitions and limit our ability to grow 
in addition  we receive payments and incentives from certain manufacturers based  in part  on our csi ratings  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi ratings do not meet stated criteria 
manufacturers actions in connection with any proposed acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire any additional dealerships selling such manufacturer s automobiles 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain csi rating and sales performance criteria as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these 
table of contents performance criteria at any applicable time or that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may prevent us from being able to take advantage of market opportunities  and may limit our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining manufacturer consents can take a significant amount of time  generally to days or more 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well into our overall strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel and upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose to fund  causing us to divert our financial resources away from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by manufacturers of their right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we otherwise would acquire thereby having an adverse effect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
likewise  from time to time  we may determine that it is in our best interest to sell one or more of our dealerships 
parties that are interested in acquiring any dealership may also be required to obtain the consent of the manufacturer 
the refusal by the manufacturer to approve a potential buyer may delay the sale of that dealership  and would require us to find another potential buyer or wait until the buyer is able to meet the requirements of the manufacturer 
a delay in the sale of a dealership could have a negative impact on our profitability and an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales that may be maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis  as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets 
if we reach any of these limits  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could negatively affect our future growth 
if state laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
applicable state laws generally provide that an automobile manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow them to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of applicable state laws 
our framework agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that  among other things  attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under applicable state laws 
if these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of these state laws  it may also be more difficult for us to renew our dealer agreements upon expiration 
changes in laws that provide manufacturers the opportunity to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  courts have held that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede the state laws that protect automotive retailers resulting in either the termination  non renewal or rejection of franchises by such manufacturers 
our dealerships profitability depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry 
the profitability of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue through new light vehicle sales 
new light vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and services 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations on mid line import and luxury brands 
our current brand mix is weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands  with the remaining consisting of domestic and value brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new light vehicle sales were as follows brand of total new light vehicle revenues honda nissan toyota bmw mercedes benz ford lexus 
table of contents if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or has a reputation for producing undesirable vehicles  and we own dealerships that sell that manufacturer s vehicles  our revenues at those dealerships could be adversely affected as consumers shift their vehicle purchases toward more desirable brands  makes and models 
we depend on our ability to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but are the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership  and in some instances on the level of capital expenditures associated with such dealerships 
if our dealerships experience prolonged periods of sales declines  those manufacturers may cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and  as a result  our new vehicle sales and profits may decline 
if vehicle manufacturers reduce or discontinue sales incentive  warranties or other promotional programs  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our dealerships benefit from certain sales incentives  warranties and other promotional programs of vehicle manufacturers that are intended to promote and support their respective new vehicle sales 
some key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special financing or leasing terms  warranties on new and used vehicles  and sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
any reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our sales volume which  in turn  could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which may have a number of impacts on us  including adversely impacting our business  financial condition and results of operations  or even deterring an acquisition of us 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without the applicable manufacturer s consent 
our agreements with some manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  we may lose the franchise either through termination or forced sale if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified percentage of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
triggers of these clauses are often based upon actions by our stockholders and are generally outside of our control  and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
a continued decline in consumer demand  due to general economic conditions  changes in preferences  or otherwise  will adversely affect us 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
further  retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as levels of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
we have experienced difficult economic conditions in the us and globally over the last two years and we expect only a modest improvement in the economy during as evidence of this  the saar of new vehicle sales in the us decreased to million in  compared to million in us industry wide vehicle sales for the full year of the current economic climate in the us continues to have a significant impact on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles  especially as unemployment rates remain high and housing prices remain unstable 
in addition  fuel prices have been unstable and have reached historically high levels in the recent past 
significant increases in gasoline prices could cause a reduction in automobile purchases and a further shift in buying patterns from luxury or suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower profit margins 
a continued shift in preferences by consumers for smaller  more economic vehicles may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents while a decline in demand for new vehicles in some instances creates additional demand for parts and services due to the aging of and increased wear and tear on existing vehicles  in difficult economic conditions  people often delay service and repairs on their vehicles 
continued delays on the service and repairs of vehicles due to general economic conditions or otherwise could have a further adverse effect on our parts and service business  which has traditionally produced higher profit margins for our business  and thus could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our sales of vehicles  our results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by depressed levels of available consumer financing 
the majority of vehicle purchase transactions are financed  particularly used vehicle transactions 
since the beginning of the global recession in december  consumers have experienced a decline in the availability of credit due to a number of factors  including an overall tightening of the lending markets 
in addition  manufacturers have also decreased the availability of leases or terminated leasing programs altogether 
the reduced availability of credit and the increase in the cost to consumers for such credit has resulted in a decline in our vehicle sales 
a continued reduction in credit availability  or continued high costs thereof  could result in a decline in our vehicle sales that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing to those buyers who  for a number of reasons  do not have access to traditional financing  including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle 
sub prime lenders have become more stringent with their credit standards  which has made it more difficult for consumers needing sub prime financing to obtain credit 
furthermore  the sub prime lenders may continue to apply higher standards in the future 
if the current depressed levels of availability of credit in the sub prime lending market continue  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited  resulting in a decline in our used vehicle sales 
retail sales of used vehicles generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles 
a decline in our used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and an adverse effect on our profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in one or more of our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our overall corporate results are also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in the various geographic markets in which we operate 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  chapel hill  charlotte  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  fayetteville  fort pierce  fresno  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  los angeles  orlando  princeton  richmond  st 
louis and tampa markets 
if economic conditions remain at current levels  consumer spending remains low or competition for services offered by automotive retailers remains significant in any of these markets  or any of these factors becomes exacerbated  our results of operations  revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
our business is seasonal  and events occurring during seasons that revenues are typically higher may disproportionately affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for vehicles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters than in our second and third quarters 
if conditions occur during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year will be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions  foreign trade risks and currency valuations that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the us as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including import duties  exchange rates  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the us or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
relative weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies in the future may result in an increase in costs to us and in the retail price of such vehicles or parts  which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles and adversely impact our profitability 

table of contents if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we may be unable to realize desired results and divert resources from comparatively more profitable operations 
we believe that the automobile retailing industry is a mature industry whose sales are significantly impacted by the prevailing economic climate  both nationally and in local markets 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion  control costs in our operations and acquire and integrate acquired dealerships into our organization 
when acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships and impairing relationships with employees  incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources to newly acquired dealerships  and impairing relationships with manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risks associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to grow our business through acquisitions if attractive targets are not available or if the market drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 
we believe that the us automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates 
however  we often compete with several other national  regional and local dealer groups  and other strategic and financial buyers  some of which may have greater financial resources  in evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
competition for attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us  and increased acquisition costs 
we may have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  other used vehicle retailers  internet based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on our advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
further  our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or additional franchises are awarded in our markets 

table of contents property loss  business interruptions or other uninsured liabilities at some of our dealerships could impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the automotive retail business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
we have historically experienced business interruptions from time to time at several of our dealerships due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events  such as hurricanes in florida and tornadoes and hail storms in texas 
other potential liabilities arising out of our operations may involve claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
to the extent we experience future events such as these  or others  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely impacted 
we rely on the management information systems at our dealerships  which are licensed from third parties and are used in all aspects of our sales and service efforts  as well as in the preparation of our consolidating financial and operating data 
to the extent these systems become unavailable to us for any reason  or if our relationship deteriorates with third party providers  our business could be significantly disrupted which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
while we maintain insurance to protect against a number of losses  this insurance coverage often contains significant deductibles which we must pay prior to obtaining insurance coverage 
in addition  we choose to self insure for a portion of our potential liabilities  meaning we do not carry insurance from a third party for such liabilities  and are wholly responsible for any related losses 
furthermore  the laws of some states prohibit insurance against certain types of liabilities  and so we self insure for those liabilities 
in certain instances  our insurance may not fully cover a loss depending on the applicable deductible or the magnitude and nature of the claim 
additionally  changes in the cost of insurance or the availability of insurance in the future could substantially increase our costs to maintain our current level of coverage or could cause us to reduce our insurance coverage and increase our self insured risks 
to the extent we incur significant additional costs for insurance  suffer losses that are not covered by in force insurance or suffer losses for which we are self insured  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
government regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are  and expect to continue to be  subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  including local licensing requirements 
these laws regulate the conduct of our business  including motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit  deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  advertising  land use and zoning  and health and safety and employment practices 
environmental laws and regulations govern  among other things  discharges into the air and water  storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
in addition  we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment and or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes 
these federal and state statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
similar to many of our competitors  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such federal and state statutes 
in addition  we may be subject to broad liabilities arising out of contamination at our currently and formerly owned or operated facilities  at locations to which hazardous substances were transported from such facilities  and at such locations related to entities formerly affiliated with us 
although for some such potential liabilities we believe we are entitled to indemnification from other entities  we cannot assure you that such entities will view their obligations as we do or will be able or 
table of contents willing to satisfy them 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  or significant additional expenditures required to maintain compliance therewith  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate or are alleged to violate laws and regulations applicable to them or protecting consumers generally  we could be subject to individual claims or consumer class actions  administrative  civil or criminal actions investigations or actions and adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees and administrative or document fees that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales  which could restrict our ability to generate revenue from these activities 
furthermore  the enactment of new laws and regulations that materially impair or restrict our sales  finance and insurance  or other operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects 
for example  in recent years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the us have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
these activities have led many lenders to limit the amounts that may be charged to customers as fee income for these activities 
if these or similar activities were to significantly restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers  we could be adversely affected 
likewise  employees and former employees are protected by a variety of employment laws and regulations 
allegations of a violation could subject us to individual claims or consumer class actions  administrative investigations or adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and civil fines and penalties 
we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with employees and with customers regarding our products and services  and expect to continue to be subject to claims related to our existing business and any new business 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant license or permit or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and future prospects 
we further expect that  from time to time  new laws and regulations  particularly in the labor  employment  environmental and consumer protection areas will be enacted  and compliance with such laws  or penalties for failure to comply  could significantly increase our costs 
healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
rising healthcare costs and interest in universal healthcare coverage in the us have resulted in government and private sector initiatives proposing healthcare reforms 
recently  president obama and members of congress have proposed significant reforms to the us healthcare system 
we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us 
however  an expansion in government s role in the us healthcare industry could result in significant costs to us  which could in turn adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
governmental regulation pertaining to fuel economy cafe standards may affect a manufacturer s ability to produce cost effective vehicles  which would impact our sales 
the energy policy conservation act  enacted into law by congress in  added title v  improving automotive efficiency  to the motor vehicle information and cost savings act and established corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for passenger cars and light trucks 
cafe is the sales weighted average fuel economy  expressed in miles per gallon mpg of a manufacturer s fleet of passenger cars or light trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of  pounds or less  manufactured for sale in the us  for any given model year 
the primary goal of cafe was to substantially increase passenger car fuel efficiency 
congress has continuously increased the standards since and  since mid year  the passenger car standard was increased to miles per gallon  a level at which it has remained through passenger car fuel economy is now required to rise to an industry average of miles per gallon by likewise  significant changes to light truck cafe standards have been established over the years 
the standard is expected to be increased to about miles per gallon by the penalty for a manufacturer s failure to meet the cafe standards is currently per tenth of a mile per gallon for each tenth under the target volume times the total volume of those vehicles manufactured for a given model year 
failure of a manufacturer to develop passenger vehicles and light trucks that meet cafe standards could subject the manufacturer to substantial penalties  increase the cost of vehicles sold to us  and adversely affect our ability to market and sell vehicles to meet consumer needs and desires 
furthermore  congress may continue to increase cafe standards in the future and such additional legislation may have a further adverse impact on the manufacturers and our business operations 

table of contents future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team 
manufacturer dealer or framework agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers or other management positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the profitability of our operations  or may result in a violation of an applicable dealer or framework agreement 
in addition  we may need to hire additional managers or other key personnel from time to time 
in some instances  potential acquisitions are more viable to us if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manager of an acquired dealership not continue to manage the business 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by us or the manufacturers 
we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans  which may have an adverse effect on our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises dealership locations in metropolitan markets within states as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  vehicle maintenance  replacement parts and collision repair services  and financing  insurance and service contracts 
as of december   we offered domestic and foreign brands of new vehicles  including heavy truck brands 
our current brand mix is weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands  with the remaining consisting of domestic and value brands 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve customers in our local markets 
our retail network is made up of the following locally branded dealership groups coggin dealerships  operating primarily in the florida markets of jacksonville  fort pierce and orlando  courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  florida  crown dealerships operating in new jersey  north carolina  south carolina and virginia  nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia  mcdavid dealerships operating in texas  north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas  california dealerships operating in los angeles and fresno  plaza dealerships operating in st 
louis  missouri  and gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi 
our revenues are derived primarily from i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new light vehicle retail and commercial customers fleet  and the sale of new heavy trucks heavy trucks the terms new light vehicle retail  fleet and heavy trucks being collectively referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts collectively referred to as parts and service  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of a number of aftermarket products  such as insurance  warranty and service contracts collectively referred to as f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold  our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on dealership generated f i gross profit per vehicle sold 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve full months same store 
our organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy  our strong brand mix and the production of attractive products by automotive manufacturers whose brands we sell 
our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with local and national economic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit  fuel prices  product availability and unemployment 
we believe that the impact on our business by any future negative trends in new vehicle sales will be partially mitigated by i the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long term  ii the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure and iii our advantageous brand mix 
historically  our brand mix has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
however  the current economic slowdown has resulted in reduced vehicle sales across all brands 
our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of new vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales and sales of parts and service 
as a result  when used vehicle and parts and service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase 
we continue to focus on expense control  although such efforts may not keep pace with lower gross profit in the event that our sales volumes continue to decline or margins come under further pressure 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our cost structure is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable such as advertising  generally allowing us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long term 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit 
our operating results are generally subject to changes in the economic environment as well as seasonal variations 
we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors related to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 

table of contents the automotive retail market declined significantly in  particularly in the fourth quarter  reflecting the impact of weak economic conditions in the us and globally  including turmoil in the credit markets  broad declines in the equity markets  consumer confidence  rising unemployment and continued weakness in the housing market 
the effects of these conditions continued through  as the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the us  which was over million from to  decreased to approximately million in and million in during the past two years  more stringent lending standards for automotive financing and certain manufacturers decisions to reduce support of customer leasing programs have limited some customers ability to purchase or otherwise acquire vehicles 
in the third quarter of  the federal government s car allowance rebate system cars program  otherwise known as cash for clunkers  provided consumers a rebate of between  and  if they traded in an eligible vehicle in connection with the purchase of a more fuel efficient new vehicle 
the us department of transportation estimated that this program led to the sale of nearly  new vehicles during july and august  and the us new vehicle retail saar reached million in august we sold approximately  new vehicles as part of the cars program  and we believe the attention that this program created increased traffic at our stores and led to additional new and used vehicle sales that were not part of the cars program 
in september  after the expiration of the cash for clunkers program  the us new vehicle saar was million 
our heavy truck business continued to be adversely impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions  particularly in the home building and construction markets 
for example  class truck sales in the united states have declined approximately over the last two years 
in the fourth quarter of  our new heavy truck revenues declined compared to the prior period and  on a pre tax basis  our heavy truck business lost million in the fourth quarter  driven primarily by inventory losses 
our heavy truck business generated a pre tax loss of million in  compared to a million pre tax profit in we expect the us automotive retail market will experience a modest recovery in  as we believe that the majority of automotive manufacturers have stabilized production levels in response to the economic slowdown and will focus on using a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs to increase demand in  although no assurance can be provided in this regard 
additionally  we anticipate that mid line import brands  which comprised approximately of our light vehicle revenues in  will continue to increase their share of the us market  and that luxury brands  which comprised approximately of our light vehicle revenues in  will maintain a strong presence in the market 
management s response to the current economic environment in response to the weakening us automotive retail environment  we took a number of actions designed to reduce our overhead and more closely align the expense structure of our dealerships to current business levels 
these actions  which were initiated during the third quarter of and continued through  included the relocation of our corporate offices  the elimination of our regional management structure and the implementation of store level productivity initiatives 
we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to duluth  georgia  during the first quarter of this relocation has delivered annualized pre tax cost savings of approximately million in  resulting principally from staffing reductions  and we believe potential rent savings could increase future annualized savings to approximately million 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began to recognize virtually all of the approximately million of the anticipated annualized rent and personnel savings related to the elimination of the regional management structure 
during  we incurred pre tax costs of approximately million associated with our restructuring plans 
we expect to receive the full recurring cost saving benefits of our relocation and restructuring beginning in our restructuring plans  store level productivity initiatives and variable cost structure reduced same store operating expense by million in as compared to since the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we have eliminated our dividend payments  significantly reduced our capital expenditure plans  generated million in net proceeds from the sale of assets and paid down million of our non floor plan debt  excluding repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
during  we increased our threshold for acquisition targets and  for the foreseeable future  expect that we will consider targeting potential acquisitions to the extent we expect them to meet our current return on investment thresholds 
also during this period  we have focused on improving our working capital by i increasing our floor plan notes payable related to our loaner vehicles and new vehicles obtained from third party dealerships  ii continuing to lower our new and used inventory balances and iii improving our collection of contracts in transit and accounts receivable 
by the end of  we completed the centralization of our payroll processing 
we are also currently engaged in numerous additional store level productivity initiatives  including i the transition to one common dealership management system and ii the consolidation of certain dealership accounting functions 
we believe that our current liquidity position  our operating cash flow and plans for adhering to a disciplined capital spending budget will enable us to support our operations as well as the initiatives mentioned above 
we are subject to a number of financial covenants in our various debt and lease agreements 
in  we modified certain of those covenants in a manner which in turn reduced the level of cash flow from operations necessary to remain in compliance with those covenants 
in connection therewith  we agreed to i a reduction in total credit commitments  ii additional restrictions on new indebtedness and iii an increase in the interest rates on outstanding borrowings

the million decrease in new vehicle revenue was primarily a result of a million decrease in same store light vehicle revenue due to a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales and a decrease in same store fleet unit sales 
these decreases were partially offset by million of revenue derived from acquisitions 
the decrease in new vehicle revenue was driven by low consumer confidence  the overall economic environment and the turmoil in the financial markets  which led to more stringent lending standards for manufacturer captive and bank financing  including decreasing loan to value ratios and increasing credit score requirements for consumers 
unit volumes declined across each of our brand segments  consistent with overall us vehicle sales 
this was partially offset by the sale of approximately  new vehicles in connection with the cash for clunkers program 
we believe the attention that this program created increased traffic at our stores and led to additional new and used vehicle sales that were not part of the cash for clunkers program 
new vehicle saar  which was million for the full year of  decreased to million during  however  new vehicle saar showed improvement from september when the saar was million after the expiration of the cash for clunkers program to million for the fourth quarter 
we expect a modest recovery of overall us vehicle sales in  as luxury brands maintain current sales levels and mid line import brands continue to gain market share 
the million decrease in new vehicle gross profit was due to a million decrease in same store light vehicle gross profit  resulting from a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales 
additionally  we experienced an increased year over year decline in gross profit from our mid line import brands primarily as a result of incentive programs in these decreases were partially offset by million of gross profit derived from acquisitions and a basis point increase in same store gross margin 
the unit sales decrease reflects a competitive marketplace with less overall sales due to the overall weak economic environment and more stringent lending standards 
our heavy truck business continued to be adversely impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions  particularly in the home building and construction markets

the million decrease in used vehicle revenue includes a million decrease in same store light vehicle retail revenue and a million decrease in same store light vehicle wholesale revenue  partially offset by million derived from dealership acquisitions 
the million decrease in used vehicle gross profit was primarily a result of a million decrease in same store light vehicle retail gross profit and a million decrease in used vehicle gross profit  including wholesale gross profit  within our heavy truck business  partially offset by a million increase in same store light vehicle wholesale gross profit 
the decrease in used light vehicle retail revenue and gross profit was driven by unit volume declines that reflected i a weak retail environment and ii a more stringent lending environment  which in turn resulted in lower sales to sub prime customers 
light vehicle used retail revenue per vehicle retailed pvr increased  with light vehicle retail gross profit pvr remaining relatively flat 
the increase in used light vehicle revenue pvr reflected a shift in the used vehicle market  from lower priced models previously appealing to sub prime customers to higher priced models and certified pre owned cpo vehicles 
the decrease in used vehicle wholesale revenue was a result of lower new retail and used retail unit sales  which resulted in fewer vehicles from trade ins available to sell at auction

in addition  we continue to focus on aligning our used vehicle inventory to meet consumer demands by offering cpo vehicles  traditional used vehicles and lower value vehicles obtained through trade ins

the million decrease in parts and service revenues and million decrease in parts and service gross profit were due to a decrease in customer pay business as well as a decrease in warranty business

these decreases were partially offset by million of revenue derived from acquisitions 
the decreases in new vehicle revenue were driven by declining consumer confidence  an overall weak economic environment  more stringent lending standards and a mix shift toward more fuel efficient  lower priced vehicles  and away from the higher priced trucks and suvs 
the new vehicle business declined significantly throughout we experienced sales decreases across all brands  however  our sales declines were generally in line with overall us vehicle sales and brand specific sales in our regions 
new vehicle saar reached its lowest level since  decreasing to million in  from million in our revenue was negatively impacted by turmoil in the financial markets  which led to more stringent lending standards for manufacturer captive and bank financing  including decreasing loan to value ratios and increasing credit score requirements 
unit volumes declined in each brand segment including a decrease in same store light vehicle retail unit sales from our mid line domestic brands  a decrease from our luxury brands and an decrease from our mid line import brands

the million decrease in used vehicle gross profit was primarily a result of a million decrease in same store retail gross profit 
the decrease in used vehicle retail revenue and gross profit reflect i a weak retail environment  ii a more stringent lending environment  iii lower sales to sub prime customers and iv a sharp increase in consumer demand for smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles and away from trucks and suvs 
the rapid decline in consumer demand for trucks and suvs caused us to lower our inventory and retail more of these vehicles that otherwise would have been wholesaled because of weak demand for these vehicles at auction 
the decrease in used vehicle wholesale revenue was a result of lower new retail and used retail unit sales  which resulted in fewer vehicles from trade ins available to sell at auction

cash flow classification of cash flows associated with floor plan notes payable borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a lender unaffiliated with the entity from which we purchase a particular new vehicle  and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles collectively referred to as floor plan notes payable non trade  are classified as financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  with borrowings reflected separately from repayments 
the net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the entity from which we purchase new vehicles collectively referred to as floor plan notes payable trade is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows

cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the 
table of contents former are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory  while the latter are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender not affiliated with the entity from which we purchased the related inventory 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a specified time period after the related vehicle is sold

application of critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting estimates described below are those that require management judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
impairment of long lived assets we identified potential impairment indicators related to certain of our real estate  after giving consideration to the likelihood that certain facilities would not be sold or used by a prospective buyer as an automobile dealership operation given current market conditions 
we reviewed the carrying value of such assets compared to estimates of fair market values determined by third party appraisal and brokers opinions of value 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash impairment of certain property and equipment during f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a customer prepays or defaults on a retail sales contract or cancels an insurance or warranty contract 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
our loss histories vary depending on the product but generally range between and
