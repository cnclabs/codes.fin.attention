item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated january  in florida  preserves and distributes human tissues and develops  manufactures  and commercializes medical devices for cardiac and vascular transplant applications 
the human tissue distributed by cryolife includes the cryovalve sg pulmonary heart valve cryovalve sgpv and the cryopatch sg pulmonary cardiac patch tissue cryopatch sg  both processed using cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology 
cryolife s medical devices include surgical adhesives  sealants  and hemostats including bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue  biofoam surgical matrix biofoam  and hemostase hemostase  which the company distributes for medafor  inc medafor  as well as other medical devices 
for the year ended december  cryolife achieved record revenues and operating income  surpassing million in revenues and reaching million in operating income 
in addition  cryolife generated million in cash during  including million in cash from operations  the largest inflow of cash from operations in company history 
see the results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during recent events during the fourth quarter of and in january  cryolife completed the purchase of approximately million shares of medafor common stock for per share 
based on the most recent information available to cryolife  these shares represent approximately of medafor s stock 
the stock purchase agreements contain terms that could require the company to make an additional make whole payment if cryolife acquires more than of the diluted outstanding stock of medafor or merges with medafor within a year period for a share price in excess of the price initially paid 
the company accounted for these contract provisions as an embedded derivative the medafor derivative 
the estimated value of the medafor derivative was approximately  at december  in january cryolife announced that it had contacted medafor s board and proposed a purchase price of per share for the remaining outstanding shares  to be paid in a mixture of cash and cryolife stock 
the parties have exchanged letters regarding cryolife s proposal  but on february  medafor s board of directors stated that it would not meet with cryolife to discuss its offer 
critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold 
therefore  the tissues the company preserves and processes are not held as inventory 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
although the company cannot own human tissue  the preservation process is a manufacturing process that is accounted for using the same principles as inventory costing 
preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing activities and facility allocations 
preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to an implanting facility 
allocation of fixed production overheads is based on actual production levels  to the extent that they are within the range of the facility s normal capacity 
cost of preservation services also includes idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  extra freight  and rehandling costs  as applicable 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent procurement agencies  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date  a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management believes that this estimate is an appropriate approximation of the tissue that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could result in an adjustment to or write down of deferred preservation costs and  therefore  materially effect the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the cost of preservation services on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as a part of the normal course of business  the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value or if there is any impairment to the costs for tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of their packaging 
cryolife records a charge to cost of preservation services to write down the amount of deferred preservation costs not deemed to be recoverable 
lower of cost or market value write downs are typically primarily due to excess tissue processing costs incurred during the write down period that exceed the estimated market value of the tissue  based on then recent average service fees 
impairment write downs are recorded based on the book value of the impaired tissues 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels if the market value of tissues increases or when tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company recorded write downs to its deferred preservation costs totaling   and  for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated deferred tax assets primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for tissue processing and product liability claims  and operating losses 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the period from through the third quarter of  cryolife maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of its deferred tax assets 
at each quarterly period during this time the company concluded that  based on its analysis  a valuation allowance was needed on its deferred tax assets 
the company reassessed its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and the appropriate levels of the valuation allowance  as of december  in conducting this assessment  management considered a variety of factors  including the company s operating profits for the years ended december  and  the reasons for the company s operating losses in prior years  and management s judgment as to the likelihood of continued profitability and expectations of future performance  and other factors 
based on this analysis  as of december  the company determined that maintaining a full valuation on its deferred tax assets was no longer appropriate 
as a result  on december  the company recorded a tax benefit of million on its consolidated statement of operations to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
the company continued to maintain valuation allowances on a portion of its deferred tax assets  primarily related to state tax net operating loss carryforwards that the company does not believe it will be able to utilize based on its projections of profitability in certain states  and state carryforward rules and limitations 
in future periods the company will assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets as necessary when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its prior determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  related to state net operating loss carryforwards  and a net deferred tax asset of million 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards  and a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets could be limited in future periods following a change in control as mandated by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which relates to certain specified changes in control of taxpayers 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
impairments of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of its long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  or significant decline in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
if cryolife determines that an impairment review is necessary  the company evaluates its assets or asset groups by comparing their carrying values to the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
if the carrying values exceed the future cash flows  then the asset or asset group is considered impaired  and cryolife will write down the value of the asset or asset group 
for the years ended december    and the company did not experience any factors that indicated that an impairment review of its long lived assets was warranted 
cryolife evaluates its non amortizing intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and  if necessary  during interim periods if factors indicate that an impairment review is warranted 
as of december  the company s non amortizing intangible assets consisted of trademarks and acquired procurement contracts and agreements 
the company performed an analysis of its non amortizing intangible assets as of december    and and determined that the fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value 
based on the results of its analysis  the company does not believe that the value of its non amortizing intangible assets was impaired as of december    or management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these non amortizing intangible assets on an annual basis 
liability claims in the normal course of business the company is made aware of adverse events involving its tissues and products 
any adverse event could ultimately give rise to a lawsuit against the company 
in addition  tissue processing and product liability claims may be asserted against the company in the future based on events it is not aware of at the present time 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to tissue processing and product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
any punitive damage components of claims are uninsured 
the company estimates its liability for and any related recoverable under the company s insurance policies as of each balance sheet date 
the company uses a frequency severity approach to estimate its unreported tissue processing and product liability claims  whereby  projected losses are calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims are determined based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim is calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the company uses a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of unreported claims included with respect to accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  during which the company experienced unusually high claim volumes  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  during which the company experienced an unusually high average cost per claim  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that the assumptions it uses to determine its unreported loss liability provide a reasonable basis for its calculation 
however  the accuracy of the estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
the company accrues its estimate of unreported tissue processing and product liability claims as components of accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and records the related recoverable insurance amounts as a component of receivables and other long term assets 
the amounts recorded represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported claims related to services performed and products sold prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and the short term and long term portions of the unreported loss liability and any related recoverable are as follows in thousands short term liability long term liability total liability short term recoverable long term recoverable total recoverable total net unreported loss liability further analysis indicated that the liability as of december  could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations calculated based on actuarial simulation techniques 
on april  the company bound liability coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is a seven year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
as of february  there were no pending tissue processing or product liability lawsuits filed against the company 
new accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   which was effective for the company beginning in the third quarter of the codification became the single authoritative source for gaap 
accordingly  previous references to gaap accounting standards are no longer used in our disclosures  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was required to adopt new accounting guidance related to subsequent events as of june  this guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the company was required to adopt new accounting guidance related to business combinations on january  the new guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have an effect on the financial position  profitability  or cash flows of the company upon adoption  but will affect the accounting for any future business combination 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the three months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue orthopaedic tissue total preservation services products bioglue and related products hemostase other medical devices total products other total revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue orthopaedic tissue total preservation services products bioglue and related products hemostase other medical devices total products other total revenues increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to the aggregate impact of volume and tissue mix  which together increased revenues by  an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange  which increased revenues by 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to the aggregate impact of volume and tissue mix  which increased revenues by 
the company s cardiac revenues consist of revenues from the distribution of heart valves  cardiac patch tissues  and minimally processed tissues that are distributed to a third party tissue processor 
the increase in revenues from the net effect of volume and tissue mix for the three months ended december  was primarily due to a increase in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues 
the revenue increase was primarily in cryopatch sg  cryovalve sgpv  and standard processed pulmonary valves 
the company believes that the increase in shipments of cardiac tissues in the three months ended december  was primarily due to increased demand in part due to a return to more normal purchasing patterns as compared to the prior year period when hospitals were cutting purchasing and reducing the level of tissues kept on hand as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions 
this increase was also due to the company s physician training efforts  including the ross summit and monthly aortic allograft workshops  which have resulted in additional physicians implanting the company s tissues  and the efforts of the company s new cardiac tissue focused sales force  the cardiac specialist program  which was implemented throughout the second half of and the beginning of the increase in revenues from the net effect of volume and tissue mix for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to favorable tissue mix due to sales of synergraft processed cardiac tissues  partially offset by a decrease in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues 
revenues increased due to shipments of the cryopatch sg  cryovalve sgpv  and aortic valves 
these increases were largely offset by decreases in standard processed pulmonary heart valves and standard processed cardiac patch tissues 
the company believes that the decrease in shipments was primarily due to the first quarter impact of hospitals decreasing the number of heart valves they keep on hand for urgent procedures as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  largely offset by increases in second  third  and fourth quarter cardiac tissue shipments when compared to the corresponding periods in the company s procurement of cardiac tissues decreased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
as a part of the normal course of business  cryolife routinely adjusts its criteria for accepting incoming tissue based on certain variables 
these variables include changes in demand for certain types of tissues processed by the company  the level of tissues currently available for shipment  changes in incoming tissue availability  and the likelihood that certain tissues will pass the company s quality controls and testing processes 
the decrease in cardiac procurement for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of changes in tissue acceptance criteria made during and the company may continue to make changes in incoming tissue acceptance criteria  and as a result  the company s level of procurement may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the company believes that its existing cardiac tissues available for shipment and current procurement levels are sufficient to support anticipated future demand for cardiac tissues for the reasonably foreseeable future 
vascular preservation services revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in vascular volume for the three months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins and to a lesser extent an increase in femoral veins 
the increase in vascular volume for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of each type of vascular tissue processed by the company 
the largest volume increases were in saphenous veins  which increased due to the strong demand for these tissues  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
the company s procurement of vascular tissues decreased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively

the company believes that its existing vascular tissues available for shipment and current procurement levels are sufficient to support anticipated future demand for vascular tissues for the reasonably foreseeable future 
bioglue and related products revenues from the sale of bioglue and related products increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by and the favorable impact of foreign exchange  which increased revenues by  partially offset by a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of bioglue and related products decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by  and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange  which reduced revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by 
sales of bioglue and related products for the three and twelve months ended december  included international sales of biofoam surgical matrix following receipt of the ce mark approval during the third quarter of biofoam sales accounted for less than of total bioglue and related product sales during the increase in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to list price increases on certain bioglue products that went into effect during and the negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the decrease in sales volume for bioglue and related products for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of bioglue in domestic markets  as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets 
management believes that hospitals are attempting to control costs by reducing spending on items  such as bioglue  that are consumed during surgical procedures 
the company has also seen some of its large competitors attempting to enforce purchasing requirements in their contracts  to the detriment of bioglue 
in addition  management believes that bioglue sales were negatively impacted as a result of changes to the alignment of the company s sales force during  including the introduction of the cardiac specialist program 
management has implemented initiatives that they believe will address these issues in the impact of foreign exchange for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and both the british pound and the euro in the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the respective periods in the company s sales of bioglue and related products through its direct sales force to united kingdom hospitals are denominated in british pounds  and its sales to german hospitals and certain distributors are denominated in euros 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
hemostase revenues from the sale of hemostase increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
hemostase revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  increased in both domestic and international markets 
cryolife began marketing and distribution of hemostase under a multinational distribution agreement with medafor  inc medafor in the second quarter of the company believes that hemostase revenues will increase in as compared to  as this product is still in a high growth phase  due to its limited penetration in the company s existing customer base 
the company s revenues from its sale of hemostase could be materially adversely impacted  however  by the company s recent unsolicited offer to purchase medafor  cryolife s lawsuit with medafor  or any current or future attempts by medafor to terminate the company s distribution agreement 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
other revenues other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  and included revenues from research grants 
other revenues for the twelve months ended december  included revenues related to the licensing of the company s technology to a third party 
as of december  cryolife has been awarded a total of million in funding allocated from us congress defense appropriations conference reports in through  collectively the dod grants  which includes million awarded in march of the dod grants were awarded to cryolife for the development of protein hydrogel technology  which the company is currently developing for use in organ sealing 
grant revenues in and are related to funding under the dod grants 
through december  cryolife has received a total million  representing all awarded funds under the dod grants 
as of december  the company had million remaining in unspent cash advances recorded as cash and cash equivalents and deferred income on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
cost of preservation services and products cost of preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of preservation services cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues cost of preservation services increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase in cost of preservation services in the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the per unit costs of processing tissues and an increase in cardiac and vascular tissues shipped  as discussed above 
the increase in cost of preservation services in the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the per unit costs of processing tissues and to a lesser extent  an increase in vascular tissues shipped  as discussed above 
the increase in the per unit costs of processing tissues in was largely a result of decreased processing and packaging throughput 
the increase in cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the increase in the per unit costs of processing tissues  partially offset by an increase in average service fees  which has had a small favorable effect on margins 
cost of products three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of products cost of products as a percentage of product revenues cost of products increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase in cost of products in the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the increase in shipments of hemostase  which the company began distributing in the second quarter of to a lesser extent  the increase in cost of products was due to a slight increase in the per unit cost of bioglue  largely offset by a decrease in the per unit cost of hemostase 
the per unit cost of hemostase decreased due to increased distribution of hemostase internationally  as international product has a reduced cost 
cost of products for the three and twelve months ended december  was negatively impacted by the write down of  and million  respectively  in other medical device inventory 
cost of products as a percentage of product revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  was comparable to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
during these periods cost of products as a percentage of product revenues increased due to increasing revenues from hemostase  which has a lower profit margin than bioglue  as well as an increase in the per unit cost of bioglue  largely offset by the favorable effect of the absence in the current year of the product write downs recorded during and an increase in bioglue average selling prices  as discussed above 
operating expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased for both the three and twelve months ended december   as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three months ended december  was primarily due to  in costs related to a reduction in workforce implemented during the quarter  the effect of a smaller reduction in tissue processing and product liability accruals  and increased professional fees  partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses related to the ross summit  which took place in the third quarter of versus the fourth quarter of the reduction in workforce was part of a company initiative to increase efficiencies and reduce costs through manufacturing process improvements  expense control  and cost cutting measures 
the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in marketing expenses  including increased personnel costs  partially related to an increase in the sales force  and other marketing expenses to support current revenue growth and the company s efforts to increase its preservation service and product offerings 
the increase was also due to the effect of a smaller reduction in tissue processing and product liability accruals and an increase in stock based compensation over the prior year period 
the company s expenses related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards were  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the company s general  administrative  and marketing expenses included a benefit for the reduction in tissue processing and product liability accruals of  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
expenses associated with business development opportunities  including costs associated with acquisitions and attempted acquisitions  may materially impact the company s general  administrative  and marketing expenses in research and development expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue research and development spending in and was primarily focused on the company s tissue preservation  synergraft products and tissues  and bioglue and related products 
synergraft products and tissues include the company s cryovalve sgpv and cryovalve sg aortic heart valves  cryopatch sg  and xenograft synergraft tissue products 
bioglue related products include bioglue  bioglue aesthetic  biofoam  and biodisc 
other income and expenses interest expense was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for the three and twelve months ended december  and included interest incurred related to the company s debt  capital leases  and interest related to uncertain tax positions 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to a reversal of interest expense related to the company s uncertain tax positions in the fourth quarter of interest income was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest income for the three and twelve months ended december  and was primarily due to interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and restricted securities 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to a decline in interest rates paid on the company s cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in the balance in these accounts 
earnings three months ended december  twelve months ended december  income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income diluted shares outstanding diluted income per common share income before income taxes increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
income before income taxes for the three and twelve months ended december  increased primarily due to an increase in revenues and other factors as discussed above 
the company s effective income tax rate was and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  which included the effect of the company s federal  state  and foreign tax obligations 
the company s income tax benefit for the three and twelve months ended december  included million in reversals of the company s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
this reversal was partially offset by current tax expense including alternative minimum tax on the company s taxable income that could not be offset by the company s net operating loss carryforwards  state tax obligations  and foreign taxes on income of the company s wholly owned european subsidiary
