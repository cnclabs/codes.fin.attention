in addition  the company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately  in critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  pension costs and obligations  stock based compensation and income taxes 

table of contents sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
revenue from product sales  less related sales allowances  is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers 
these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs  which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year 
discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale 
while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts  certain of the allowances  such as the returns allowance  are based on market data  historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 
for its allowance programs that are not fixed  such as returns  the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions 
these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues 
during  there have been no material adjustments to the company s estimates made in prior years 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value 
accordingly  no impairment was indicated 
the company s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairments were indicated 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or 
table of contents decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  the company wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately  to reflect revised expectations for the related product lines 
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the company s ability to earn out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the non recoverable minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties 
at december   the company had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  of which are included in other assets 
pension costs and obligations pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates 
at the end of the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us  with no future benefits accruing to employees 
the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze 
the estimates for the company s us plans are established at the company s measurement date 
the company uses its fiscal year end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on us plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense for the us plans was 
a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased pension expense for us plans by approximately discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of pension expense averaged 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the company s discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately and  respectively 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   the company s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of  included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to  at december  the decrease primarily reflects amortization of these actuarial losses in pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

table of contents stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan for employees and non employee members of the company s board of directors 
under this plan  the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the company s stock  as well as restricted stock  restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards 
the company measures all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
total stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   december  and december  was   and  respectively 
as of december   total unrecognized stock based compensation cost was approximately  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans 
the black scholes method includes four significant assumptions expected term of the options  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  and expected stock price volatility 
the weighted average expected terms used were approximately years for the grant and approximately years for the and stock option grants 
these amounts are based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option 
the weighted average risk free interest rates used for  and stock option grants were  and  respectively 
this estimate was based on the interest rate available on us treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option 
the weighted average expected dividend yields used for the  and stock option grants were  and  respectively  which is based on the company s current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant 
the weighted average expected stock price volatilities used were for the stock option grant and for the and stock option grants 
these amounts were derived using a combination of historical price volatility and current implied price volatility 
implied price volatility reflects the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the company s common stock  which the company believes represents the expected future volatility of the company s stock price 
the company believes that since this is a market based estimate  it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility 
the increase in the stock volatility assumption in reflects the increase in stock market volatility at the time of the company s grant 
in  and  as part of its employee stock based compensation plan  the company issued contingent stock performance awards  which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the company s common stock based on the company s achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended december  december and december for the  and awards  respectively 
each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets 
these awards are valued based on the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of the grant and expensed over the performance period 
the measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the company s current estimate of net revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period 
changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards 
income taxes the company s annual income tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates  changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable  these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges 
these estimated liabilities are adjusted  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company s quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company s quarterly operating 
table of contents results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time 
changes in the company s estimated effective income tax rate during were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year  or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs 
during  the company recorded a total benefit of approximately  related to discrete tax events primarily related to expiration of state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations 
in certain cases  tax law requires items to be included in the company s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company s income tax returns 
valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income  including capital gains  to fully realize the future credits  deductions or capital losses 
deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company s financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company s income tax return 
in  the mexican government instituted a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income based tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax  it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized 
as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income based tax in  it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable 
should the facts and circumstances change  the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations  which may result in additional tax expense 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of its business  the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license  which may require the payment of minimum guarantees  as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment 
in addition  the company has  in principal amount of long term debt outstanding at december  future payments required under these and other obligations as of december  are as follows payments due by fiscal year certain contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease commitments future minimum guaranteed contractual payments tax sharing agreement purchase commitments the company has a liability at december   including potential interest and penalties  of  for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns 
the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such  does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability 
accordingly  these amounts are not included in the table above 

table of contents in connection with the company s agreement to form a joint venture with discovery  the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement 
these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture

included in the thereafter column above is  in principal amount of senior convertible debt due the holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the company in december and december at the principal amount 
at that time  the purchase price may be paid in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of the two

financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars  hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies 
results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar  hong kong dollar  euro  british pound  canadian dollar and mexican peso and  to a lesser extent  currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 
to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign denominated revenues and expenses 
the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange 
from time to time  affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency 
the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

table of contents the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts 
at december   these contracts had unrealized gains of  of which  are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  are recorded in other assets 
included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december  are deferred gains of  net of tax  related to these derivatives 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt  excluding fair value adjustments  of  during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into several interest rate swap agreements  with a total notional amount of  to adjust the amount of long term debt subject to fixed interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt 
changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long term debt 
at december   the fair value of these contracts was a liability of  which is included in other liabilities  with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease long term debt 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately  or  respectively 
a hypothetical one quarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease both pretax earnings and cash flows by the economy and inflation the principal market for the company s products is the retail sector 
revenues from the company s top five customers  all retailers  accounted for approximately of its consolidated net revenues in and of its consolidated net revenues in and in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year 
in  approximately of the company s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year 
although the company expects that this concentration will continue  particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year  this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year 
in the company had products related to the mid year major motion picture releases of transformers revenge of the fallen  gi joe the rise of cobra and x men origins wolverine 
in the company had products related to the mid year major motion picture releases of iron man  the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull 
the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items  and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment 
retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s future revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 

table of contents the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly
