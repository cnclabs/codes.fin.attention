primus financial primus financial was established to sell credit protection in the form of credit swaps primarily to global financial institutions and major credit swap dealers  referred to as counterparties  against primarily investment grade credit obligations of corporate and sovereign issuers 
in exchange for a fixed quarterly premium  primus financial agreed  upon the occurrence of a default or other defined credit event eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay or restructuring affecting a designated issuer  referred to as a reference entity  to pay its counterparty an amount determined through industry sponsored auctions equivalent to the notional amount of the credit swap less the auction determined recovery price of the underlying debt obligation 
primus financial may elect to acquire the underlying security in the related auction or in the market and seek to sell such obligation at a later date 
credit swaps related to a single specified reference entity are referred to as single name credit swaps

prs trading harrier prs trading strategies  llc prs trading commenced operations in january to trade in a broad range of fixed income products  including credit default swaps  investment grade and high yield bonds  as well as leveraged loans 
in april  primus guaranty formed harrier credit strategies master fund  lp harrier 
during the second quarter of  primus guaranty transferred the trading portfolio of its subsidiary  prs trading  to harrier 
harrier traded in an expanded range of fixed income products  including credit swaps  total return swaps on loan transactions  cds indices  leveraged loans and investment grade and non investment grade securities 
prs trading was dissolved in may during the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued harrier  due in part to harrier s performance and difficulty in raising third party capital  given the market environment at that time 
as of march   harrier ceased trading activities and closed all of its remaining trading positions 
harrier was dissolved in february executive overview and business outlook the global financial and credit markets showed improvement during there was a significant rally in credit spreads across the investment grade and non investment grade sectors 
global capital markets reopened and activity levels were at high historical levels for non financial investment grade corporate bond issuances during global equity markets also showed strong performance during notwithstanding these overall positive developments  there continues to be pockets of dislocation and there is an expectation of additional corporate defaults particularly from those companies without ready access to the capital markets 
our credit swap portfolio will remain at risk to the level of credit events in and beyond  but the generally more positive market environment could also open additional opportunities for us 
our management team  in consultation with our board  has put in place a strategy that focuses on providing value to shareholders 
will be a year of transition to a growth strategy 
our strategy includes the following business priorities and initiatives pursuing new asset management opportunities in corporate credit either through acquisition or in new organically developed product  actively managing the amortization of primus financial s credit swap portfolio  developing a new credit protection business allocating capital to benefit shareholders and to support business growth  and aligning costs with our business initiatives 
we are continuing to pursue opportunities to grow our assets under management and developing new streams of asset management revenues 
specifically  we see opportunities to acquire companies  asset management contracts and structured credit assets arising from the consolidation which is likely to continue during within the structured credit markets 
as previously discussed  on july   primus asset management completed the acquisition of cypresstree  a well respected clo manager 
primus asset management has developed and is beginning to market various fund management alternatives which take advantage of its established credit platform across us global investment grade and high yield credit 
primus asset management plans to develop a broader internal marketing and distribution capability to raise third party capital for these funds 
we also believe it is possible that the structured credit markets will reopen for new transactions during which could then present potential opportunities for primus asset management 

table of contents our second priority is actively managing primus financial s credit swap portfolio in amortization 
primus financial will amortize its existing portfolio of credit swaps through to their stated maturity  unless terminated earlier 
during  approximately billion notional amount of credit swap contracts matured and a further billion was terminated  primarily the result of portfolio repositioning transactions  which are discussed below 
we expect an additional billion notional to mature in management s focus in amortizing primus financial s credit swap portfolio is to seek to maximize its potential long term value 
the most important element in determining value will be the credit losses primus financial may incur over the credit swap portfolio s remaining life 
during  primus financial entered into three substantial portfolio repositioning transactions seeking to reduce the net risk of its credit swap portfolio  thereby increasing the likelihood that its credit swap portfolio will have significant value at its final maturity 
these transactions are described below 
in july  primus financial entered into a transaction with a significant bank counterparty with respect to credit default swaps having a total notional principal of billion 
under the terms of the transaction  primus financial and the bank terminated credit default swaps with an aggregate notional principal of million  primarily on a financial guaranty insurance company reference entity 
primus financial paid a termination fee of million to the counterparty to terminate these swaps  a significant discount to the carrying value of these credit swaps at the time of the transaction 
in addition  primus financial assigned the remaining credit default swaps that it had sold to the counterparty to a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary 
primus financial paid an assignment fee of approximately million to its subsidiary  which the subsidiary uses as its capital 
the subsidiary s potential liability under the credit default swap contracts with the counterparty is limited to this million plus future premiums and earned interest 
the subsidiary used the million to purchase a corporate note from the counterparty on which it receives a return 
a security interest in the corporate note plus accrued interest of approximately  at december  has been granted in favor of the counterparty 
at the maturity of this portfolio in march  any capital remaining in this subsidiary will be returned to primus financial 
in september  primus financial terminated billion notional principal of credit swaps with a significant bank counterparty 
these credit swaps represented the counterparty s entire portfolio 
primus financial paid million to the counterparty  a significant discount to the carrying value of the portfolio at the time of the transaction  to terminate these credit swaps 
included in this portfolio were a small number of reference entities which primus financial concluded had a high risk profile 
in november  primus financial completed a third portfolio repositioning transaction with a significant bank counterparty 
primus financial assigned a portfolio of credit swaps comprising notional principal of billion of bespoke tranche transactions and approximately million of single name credit swaps  to a second newly formed wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with this transaction  primus financial paid an assignment fee of million to its subsidiary 
the subsidiary and the counterparty then agreed to restructure the portfolio such that the single name credit swaps were terminated and the tranche transactions were revised to reflect a new notional principal totaling billion 
the subsidiary paid the counterparty a restructuring fee of million 
the subsidiary s potential liability under the credit default swap contracts with the counterparty is limited to million plus future premiums and earned interest 
future credit swap premiums payable by the counterparty on the restructured portfolio will be approximately million less than the future premiums on the tranche portfolio prior to restructuring 
the last tranche in the subsidiary matures in december at maturity of this portfolio any capital remaining in this subsidiary will be returned to primus financial 
a security interest in the cash plus accrued interest  aggregating approximately million as of december   has been granted in favor of the counterparty 
thus far in  primus financial has completed a fourth portfolio repositioning transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and is in discussions with other counterparties regarding additional portfolio repositioning transactions as well as targeted credit mitigation transactions 
table of contents with respect to specific reference entities 
our management believes that the transactions completed thus far have resulted in  and similar future transactions will be effected with the goal of  reducing primus financial s exposure to certain higher risk profile reference entities and tranches consistent with the objective of de risking the primus financial portfolio so as to seek to preserve its long term value 
our third priority is to evaluate the credit market for  and attempt to establish  a new credit protection business for the company 
the business strategy of this new company would seek to utilize primus asset management s credit platform to capitalize on the void as traditional providers of corporate credit protection capacity  insurance companies  cdpcs and financial guaranty companies  have left this market 
a fourth priority is optimizing capital allocation to benefit shareholders and support business growth 
during we deployed capital through equity and debt repurchases to build tangible value for shareholders 
we intend to continue to pursue this strategy  as evidenced by our board s approval in early to increase our repurchase authorization by million 
our final priority is aligning costs with business initiatives 
our people and our operating platform have been critical to our success as a company 
we continue to adjust our expenses to align our cost base with our business strategy 
accordingly  we are selectively adding to our talent base to support our strategy described above  while reducing expenses  as appropriate  in our current credit protection business 
the overall market environment has changed significantly over the past year and we have adapted our strategy to anticipate and respond to the impact of these changes 
we are transitioning to a more proactive approach to seek to take advantage of the opportunities that we see ahead for growth and value creation 
however  given the uncertain outlook for the credit markets  our strategy may continue to evolve 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and those differences may be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require management to make significant judgments and involve a higher degree of complexity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for information regarding our summary of significant accounting policies 
we have identified the valuation of our credit swaps  goodwill and other intangible assets as critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
valuation of credit swaps the fair value of the credit swap portfolio of single name credit swaps  tranches and cds on abs  depends upon a number of factors  including the contractual terms of the swap contract  which include the reference entity  the notional value  the maturity  the credit swap premium and the currency of the swap 
current market data  including credit swap premium levels pertinent to each reference entity  estimated recovery rates on reference entities  market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  an estimate of mid market prices to exit prices  and for tranche transactions  estimates of the correlation of the underlying reference entities within each tranche transaction 

table of contents valuation models  which are used to derive a fair value of credit swaps 
the valuation models have been internally developed but are benchmarked against market standard models 
consideration of our own nonperformance risk  as well as the credit risk of credit swap counterparties 
asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires that nonperformance risk be considered when determining the fair value of credit swaps 
fair value estimates of credit swaps from third party valuation services and or credit swap counterparties 
in general  the most significant component of the credit swap valuation is the difference between the contractual credit swap premium on the credit swaps transacted and the comparable current market premium 
the valuation process the company uses to obtain fair value is described below for single name credit swaps  the valuation model uses mid market credit swap premium data obtained from an independent pricing service 
the independent pricing service obtains mid market credit swap premium quotes from a number of dealers in the credit swap market across a range of standard maturities and restructuring terms  and computes composite credit swap premium quotes on specific reference entities 
the inputs to the valuation model include current credit swap premium quotes on the reference entities  estimated recovery rates on each reference entities  current interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we adjust the independent mid market credit swap premium quotes to derive exit price valuations 
for tranche credit swaps  a mid market valuation is calculated for each tranche transaction using a tranche valuation model 
the inputs to the tranche valuation model include current credit swap premium quotes obtained from an independent pricing service on the reference entities within the tranche  estimated recovery rates on the reference entities within the tranche  current market interest rates and correlation levels derived from credit swap indices 
the mid market valuations obtained from the model are adjusted to estimated exit price valuations 
for cds on abs  the valuation model uses expected cash flows on the underlying securities obtained from an independent valuation service and quotes from credit swap counterparties 
the cash flow data is used as input to an abs valuation model to obtain mid market valuations 
the mid market valuations are adjusted to obtain exit price valuations 
nonperformance risk adjustment we consider the effect of our nonperformance risk in determining the fair value of our liabilities 
since the adoption of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  on january   we have incorporated a nonperformance risk adjustment in the computation of the fair value of the credit swap portfolio 
an industry standard for calculating this adjustment is to incorporate changes in an entity s own credit spread into the computation of the mark to market of liabilities 
we derive an estimate of a credit spread because we do not have an observable market credit spread 
this estimated credit spread was obtained by reference to similar entities  primarily in the financial insurance business  which have observable spreads 

table of contents the following table represents the effect of the nonperformance risk adjustments on our unrealized loss on credit swaps  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december  and in thousands december  december  unrealized loss on credit swaps  at fair value  without nonperformance risk adjustments nonperformance risk adjustments unrealized loss on credit swaps  at fair value  after nonperformance risk adjustments the following table represents the effect of the changes in nonperformance risk adjustment on our net credit swap revenue loss in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands years ended december  net credit swap revenue loss without nonperformance risk adjustments nonperformance risk adjustments net credit swap revenue loss after nonperformance risk adjustments fair value hierarchy level level assets at december   which included the unrealized gain on credit swaps  investments in clos and abs  were million  or of the total assets measured at fair value 
level liabilities at december   which included the unrealized loss on credit swaps sold and a contingent consideration liability  were million  or of total liabilities measured at fair value 
level assets at december   which included investments in clos and trading account assets  were million  or of the total assets measured at fair value 
level liabilities at december   which included the unrealized loss on credit swaps  were billion  or of total liabilities measured at fair value 
primus financial s credit swap valuation techniques are described above 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of financial instruments and fair value disclosures 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of the reporting unit associated to the goodwill based on future expected discounted cash flows  and determine the carrying value book value of the reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 

table of contents we performed our goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our goodwill had a carrying value of million 
we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the net book value of our reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
if we incur future impairment to our goodwill  it would have an adverse impact on our future earnings 
other intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist 
for intangible assets  an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our impairment analysis and determined that no impairment charges were necessary 
at december   we had other intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
we are required to periodically evaluate our other intangible assets balances for impairments 
if we incur impairments to our other intangible assets  it would have an adverse impact on our future earnings 
for both goodwill and other intangible assets  to the extent an impairment loss is recognized  the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset 
subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted 
for amortizable intangible assets  the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which were acquired on july  in connection with the cypresstree acquisition 
impact of recent accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that is intended to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with a vie 
this guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november   with early adoption prohibited 
the company has evaluated the requirements of this new accounting standard  the company believes that the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements as it will be required to consolidate clos under management that are not currently consolidated under the current accounting standards 
this new accounting standard is effective for the company on january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
counterparty default lehman brothers special financing inc primus financial had entered into credit swap transactions with lbsf  pursuant to an isda master agreement 
at the time of these transactions  lbsf was an indirect subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc lbh  and lbh was the credit support provider under these transactions 
during and subsequent to the end of the third quarter of  lbsf suffered a number of events of default under the isda master agreement  including bankruptcy  failure to pay premiums when due and bankruptcy of its credit support provider

lbsf has been obligated to pay approximately million in premiums on its credit swap transactions since the third 
table of contents quarter of  but has failed to do so 
as a consequence  primus financial did not recognize premium income of approximately million and million on the credit swaps with lbsf during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cumulative amount of million due  but unpaid  was netted against the fair value of unrealized losses on the credit swaps with lbsf outstanding at december  in our opinion  because the defaults of lbh and lbsf are not subject to cure  as a legal matter  primus financial is not obligated to settle with lbsf with respect to any existing or future credit events 
there is little settled legal precedent to rely on pertaining to the default of a credit swap counterparty 
however  under relevant accounting standards  primus financial will continue to carry outstanding credit swaps with lbsf at their fair value 
results of operations introduction the primary component of our financial results is net credit swap revenue loss

table of contents non gaap financial measures economic results in addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap  our management and our board of directors use certain non gaap financial measures called economic results 
we believe that our economic results provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and business trends 
in addition  economic results are useful to investors as they are used by management and our board of directors in establishing performance based incentives 
economic results is an accrual based measure of our financial performance  which in our view  better reflects our long term buy and hold strategy in our credit protection business 
however  economic results is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap  therefore  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap 
we define economic results as gaap net income loss available to common shares adjusted for the following unrealized gains losses on credit swaps sold by primus financial are excluded from gaap net income loss available to common shares  realized gains from early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial are excluded from gaap net income loss available to common shares  realized gains from early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial are amortized over the period that would have been the remaining life of the credit swap  and that amortization is added to gaap net income loss available to common shares  and provision for cds on abs credit events  and reduction in provision for cds on abs credit events upon termination of credit swaps 
we exclude unrealized gains losses on credit swaps sold because quarterly changes in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio do not necessarily cause primus financial to take any specific actions relative to any reference entity or group of reference entities 
we manage the primus financial portfolio based on our assessment of credit fundamentals with a general strategy of holding credit swaps to maturity 
at maturity  the mark to market values would revert to zero  to the extent no realized gains or losses had occurred 
additionally  changes in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio have no impact on our liquidity  as primus financial does not provide counterparties with collateral 
we exclude realized gains on credit swaps sold because our strategy is focused on generation of premium income as opposed to trading gains and losses  although we amortize any realized gains over the original remaining life of the terminated contracts 
as previously discussed  credit events related to cds on abs may include any or all of the following failure to pay principal  write down in the reference obligation and distressed ratings downgrades on the reference obligation as defined in the related credit swap agreement 
there may be a protracted period between the occurrence and the settlement of a credit event on cds on abs  and thus the estimated loss resulting from the credit event continues to be classified as an unrealized loss in net credit swap revenues 
we make provisions in economic results for estimated costs of cds on abs credit events in the period in which the credit event occurs since our economic results excludes the change in unrealized losses on credit swaps sold for the period 
these provisions are adjusted subsequently to reflect the known settlement amount s in the period in which the settlement occurs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for gains or losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a consequence of changes in market conditions 
our primary market risk is changes in market credit swap premium levels  which increase or decrease the fair value of the credit swap portfolio 
market credit swap premium levels change as a result of specific events or news related to a reference entity  such as a change in a credit rating by any of the rating agencies 
additionally  market credit swap premium levels can vary as a result of changes in market sentiment 
as a general matter  given primus financial s strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  we do not seek to manage our overall exposure to market credit swap premium levels  and we expect fluctuations in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio as a result of these changes 
as of december   each ten basis point increase or decrease in market credit swap premiums would decrease or increase the fair value of the credit swap portfolio by approximately million 
we face other market risks  which are likely to have a lesser impact upon our net income available to common shares than those associated with market credit swap premium level risk 
these other risks include interest rate risk associated with market interest rate movements 
these movements may affect the value of the credit swap portfolio as our pricing model includes an interest rate component  which is used to discount future expected cash flows 
interest rate movements may also affect the carrying value of and yield on our investments 
the primus financial perpetual preferred shares pays distributions that are based upon libor
