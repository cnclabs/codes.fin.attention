in april  we acquired the assets of first cls  inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro  an atlanta based provider of local commercial real estate information 
most recently  in july  we acquired massachusetts based property and portfolio research  inc ppr  a provider of real estate analysis  market forecasts and credit risk analytics to the commercial real estate industry  and its wholly owned uk subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd  and in october  we acquired massachusetts based resolve technology  inc resolve technology  a provider of business intelligence and portfolio management software serving the institutional real estate investment industry 
the first cls  inc  ppr and resolve technology acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading recent acquisitions 
in  we began our expansion into new metropolitan markets throughout the us and began expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and us markets 
we completed our expansion into the new markets in the first quarter of in early  in conjunction with the acquisition of national research bureau  we launched a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information 
the retail component of our flagship product  costar property professional  was unveiled in may at the international council of shopping centers convention in las vegas 
during the second half of  in order to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings  we began actively researching commercial properties in new core based statistical areas cbsas in the us  we increased our us field research fleet by adding vehicles and we hired researchers to staff these vehicles 
we released our costar property professional service in the new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of throughout our recent expansion efforts  we have remained focused on ensuring that costar continues to provide the quality of information our customers expect 
as such  in we expanded our research operations  and we plan to continue to grow our research operations slightly in  in order to continue to meet customer expectations 
during the second half of  as a part of our strategy to provide subscribers with tools for conducting primary research and analysis on commercial real estate  we expanded subscribers capabilities to use costar s database of research verified commercial property information to conduct in depth analysis and generate reports on trends in sales and leasing activity online 
further  in july  we acquired ppr and its wholly owned subsidiary  providers of real estate investment analysis and market forecasting services 
in connection with our acquisitions of propex  grecam and ppr s wholly owned subsidiary property and portfolio research ltd  we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 
we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 
in  we introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations 
we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for long term growth 
we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services within our current platform  consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization 
for instance  in may  we released costar showcase  an internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public website  www 
costar 
com 
more recently  in july  we expanded subscribers analytic capabilities to use our online database to conduct in depth analysis and generate reports on sales and leasing activity through our acquisition of ppr and in october  we acquired resolve technology  which enabled us to provide our customers with additional tools for analyzing commercial real estate markets 
any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings throughout and providing substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
current general economic conditions in the us and the world are negatively affecting business operations for our clients and are resulting in more business consolidations and  in certain circumstances  failures 
as a result of these economic conditions  we continue to see customer cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay amounts due to us  although at a slower pace than in previous quarters 
if cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay continue at the current rate or increase  and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers  our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates 
additionally  current economic conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses  and customers may be forced to purchase fewer services from us or cancel all services 
we compete against many other commercial real estate information  marketing and analytic service providers for business 
if customers choose to cancel our services for cost cutting or other reasons  our revenue could decline 
the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown 
the extent and duration of any benefits resulting from any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy are currently unknown and there can be no assurance that those initiatives will be successful in the future 
because of these uncertainties  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or earnings 
however  we continue to believe that the company is positioned to generate continued  sustained earnings in our financial reporting currency is the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes  as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods 
currency volatility may continue  which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and comparisons 
we currently issue stock options and or restricted stock to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we plan to continue the use of stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  and focus services currently generate more than of our total revenues 
costar property professional  costar tenant  and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment 
focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment 
the majority of our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are generally based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the twelve months ended december  and  our contract renewal rate was approximately and  respectively 
as discussed above  our trailing twelve month contract renewal rate may continue to decline if continuing negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures and or consolidations  further reductions in customer spending or decreases in the customer base 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets 
the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors  including the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we consider our operating segments  us and international  as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss 
we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 
a decrease in the fair value of our international reporting unit as of december  would have no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of this non gaap financial measure as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information  marketing and analytic services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

comparison of business segment results for year ended december  and year ended december  we manage our business geographically in two operating segments  with our primary areas of measurement and decision making being the us and international  which includes the uk and france 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment revenue and ebitda  which is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our business

resolve technology 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of resolve technology  a delaware corporation  for approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and  shares  or approximately million  of costar restricted common stock  which shares are subject to a three year lockup 
the purchase price is subject to certain post closing adjustments 
additionally  the seller may be entitled to receive i a potential deferred cash payout two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology s revenue  and ii other potential deferred cash payouts for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through june   which period may be subject to extension to a date no later than december  accounting treatment 
these acquisitions were accounted for using purchase accounting 
the purchase price for the first cls  inc acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired customer base and goodwill 
for each of the ppr and resolve technology acquisitions  the purchase price was allocated to various working capital accounts  developed technology  customer base  trademarks  non competition agreements and goodwill 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over ten years 
the identified intangibles will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill for these acquisitions will not be amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of first cls  inc  ppr  and resolve technology have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to net cash from operating activities of approximately million  net cash provided from financing activities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of approximately million  and net cash paid for acquisitions of approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease of approximately million from net income plus non cash items  a decrease of approximately million due to changes in prepaid expenses and deposits  and decreased cash receipts for deferred revenue of million  partially offset by decreased payments for accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately million and million in increased cash receipts on receivables 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decision in to invest in money market funds and us treasuries instead of short term investment instruments  which resulted in a net sale of investments of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to sales of investments of approximately million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change is due to decreased proceeds from exercise of stock options

as such  fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for the year ended december   revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately of total revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in the carrying amount of net assets 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have increased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a weakening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  in the carrying amount of net assets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all 
as of december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately million 
we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not believe that increases or decreases in interest rates will impact our ability to operate our business in the foreseeable future

as of december   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
as a result  we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful 
in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments  we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process  who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par  resulting in a loss 
based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december   we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have approximately million in intangible assets as of december  as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
