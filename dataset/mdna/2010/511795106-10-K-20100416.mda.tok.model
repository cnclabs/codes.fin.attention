item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the global industrial protective clothing markets 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over  north american safety and mill supply distributors and end users and distributors internationally 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as integrated oil  utilities  chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as international hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments domestically and internationally such as municipal fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the military  the department of homeland security and the centers for disease control and state and privately owned utilities and integrated oil companies 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our north american sales of tyvek declined approximately for the year ended january   which continue a long term declining trend for the last four years 
the company has partially replaced these sales with increased sales of hi visibility clothing domestically and increased international sales of our products particularly our fire protective apparel 
we are experiencing competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace for tyvek protective clothing  coupled with a decline in this segment in the usa in fy as a result of the weak us economy 
the disposables segment showed a decline in gross margins  caused by the loss in volume combined with higher priced raw materials and an extremely competitive pricing environment  partially offset by labor cutbacks 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since  in china since  in india since and in brazil since may beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we have completed the moving of production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and completed this process by the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we have seen cost improvements for these particular product lines as well 
in fy  the company decided to restructure its manufacturing operations in mexico  by closing its previous facilities in celaya and opening new facilities in jerez 
the company s actual costs to close  move and start up aggregated approximately  pretax 
this restructuring allowed for lower occupancy and labor costs and a more efficient production configuration for fy and fy our r d expenses are projected to increase once again in fiscal to  an increase of  over primary drivers for this increase are certification cost for the redesign of some of our core products to reduce manufacturing costs and increase end user appeal  continued development in our chemical protective garments  and rationalization of product design globally to increase our supply flexibility 
in addition  we continue to pursue a robust list of longer term development projects targeted at replacing existing technologies currently in our product offering critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of heat protective apparel  high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting  gloves and arm guards and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our customers at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectability of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived  intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually  however  these tests may be performed more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by us gaap 
factors that the company considers important that could identify a potential impairment include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company measures any potential impairment based market quotes  if available or on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires the company s management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
on august   the company purchased mifflin valley  inc  a pennsylvania manufacturer 
this acquisition resulted in the recording of 
million in goodwill as of january  management has determined there is no impairment of this goodwill at january   and in may  the company acquired qualytextil  sa  a brazilian manufacturer 
an evaluation of this acquisition was made as of january   which resulted in the recording of million of goodwill 
management has determined there is no impairment of this goodwill at january  see notes and for further discussion of goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks  tradenames and customer contracts 
trademarks and tradenames are not amortized because they have indefinite lives 
customer contracts are amortized over their estimated useful lives of months remaining at january  impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense and other income  net income tax expense net income significant balance sheet fluctuation january  as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million is primarily the result of normal fluctuations in cash management 
the decrease in borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement is principally due to the decrease in inventories of million 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the year ended january  for the three months ended january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating profit income before tax net income th quarter operations fy th quarter fy operations reflected disposables division year end reversal of rebates accrued earlier in the year due to many customers not meeting their year end targets for rebates 
in q fy  qualytextil in brazil achieved a margin resulting from a larger bid contract 
net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the net decrease was comprised mainly of a million decrease in us disposables sales  or  a million decrease in us glove sales  or  a million decrease in us chemical sales  or  a million decrease in us reflective sales  or  and a million decrease in us wovens sales  or 
this decrease in us sales was partially offset by significant increases in foreign sales  including sales of qualytextil  sa in brazil  compared with sales of million which was included in fy for the nine months following the acquisition  sales growth of million in china  domestic  asia pacific rim and other external sales  steady sales in canada and europe and million growth in chile sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the major factors driving the changes in gross margins were disposables gross margin declined by percentage points in fy compared with fy this decline was mainly due to higher priced raw materials and an extreme competitive pricing environment coupled with lower volume  partially offset by labor cutbacks 
disposables margins in q fy were increased by a year end reversal of rebates accrued earlier in the year  due to many customers not meeting their year end targets for rebates 
brazil gross margin was for fy this year compared with last year 
several dynamics were at play 
there were several large sales which had bid requirements for complete fire ensembles including boots and or helmets 
this required qualytextil to obtain these items from vendors 
there were several issues with these vendors causing qualytextil to use different vendors under delivery pressure  resulting in higher costs 
qualytextil is presently negotiating with a boot vendor and also a helmet vendor to obtain more reliable delivery and pricing and has begun maintaining a stock of these items on hand in inventory to avoid such problems in the future 
much of qualytextil s fabric used as raw materials is imported from vendors in the us which caused unfavorable costs earlier in the year resulting from exchange rate differences 
since then the exchange rates have changed to strengthen the brazilian real which should favorably impact the cost and margins in the future 
further  the margins obtained in fy were exceptional  partially due to a very weak us dollar and may not be achieved in the near future 
in normal conditions  in the future  the qualytextil margins will be expected to be between and 
in q fy  qualytextil achieved a margin resulting from a larger bid contract 
glove division reduction in volume coupled with inventory write offs resulting in a gross loss of million 
continued gross losses of million from india in fy reflective margins were lower than the prior year mainly due to lower volume 
canada gross margin increased by percentage points primarily from more favorable exchange rates and local competitive pricing climate 
uk and europe margins increased by percentage points primarily from exchange rate differentials 
chile margins increased by percentage points primarily from higher volume and several larger sales orders 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  this increase as a percent of sales is largely due to brazil operations  which runs at a higher margin with higher operating expense 
excluding qualytextil  operating expenses decreased million for the year ended january  compared with the year ended january  the decrease in operating expenses  excluding brazil  in the year ended january  as compared to the year ended january  included million sales commissions declined  mainly resulting from lower volume 
million freight out declined  mainly resulting from lower volume and lower prevailing carrier rates 
million officers salaries declined  reflecting the retirement of ray smith to become a non employee director and chairman of the board and also reflecting an across the board reduction in total officer compensation 
million reduction in foreign exchange costs resulting from the company s hedging program and more favorable rates 
million shareholder expenses declined  reflecting the proxy fight in the prior year 
million consulting fees were reduced  resulting from using interns and revising sarbanes oxley procedures 
million reduction in employee benefits  mainly resulting from the suspension of the employer match for the k plan 
million increase in property tax  largely resulting from the canadian warehouse 
million increased depreciation largely resulting from the canadian warehouse 
million increased bank fees resulting from higher volume of sales paid by credit cards instead of customer checks million professional fees increased resulting from analysis of tax issues and an irs audit 
the company has changed independent auditing firms in the expectation that such professional fees will be reduced in the future 
million in increased operating costs in china were the result of the large increase in direct international sales made by china  which are now allocated to sg a costs  previously allocated to cost of goods sold 
qualytextil  brazil operating expenses increased million for the year ended january  compared with the year ended january  major factors in this increase are as follows million brazil operating expenses in q of this year 
brazil operations were not included in q last year  as it was acquired effective may  million start up expenses in connection with qualytextil gearing up to sell lakeland branded products 
this includes hiring sales and logistical support staff  printing of catalogs  lease of two new distribution centers and increased travel expense 
million in additional employee benefits and payroll taxes resulting from hiring as employees certain people who had been performing services on an out sourcing basis 
million additional freight out costs mainly resulting from higher volume 
million in additional commissions resulting from higher volume and higher rates paid on some larger bids 
operating profit 
operating profit decreased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  primarily due to the brazil acquisition  partially offset by increased operating expenses and lower us volumes as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because of increased borrowings due to the qualytextil acquisition and higher inventory levels  partially offset by interest rate decreases 
other income net 
other income  net decreased million principally as a result of non recurring credits in the prior year resulting from net funds recovered from a chinese manager s fraud and from a change in accounting estimate relating to certain chinese cash and accruals recorded in and prior 
income tax expense 
income tax expenses consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to a  allowance against deferred taxes resulting from the india restructuring recorded in q  losses in india with no tax benefit  tax benefit in brazil resulting from government incentive and goodwill write offs and credits to prior years taxes in the us and canada not previously recorded 
net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the decrease in net income was primarily a result of a decrease in sales in the us and an extremely low pricing environment in disposables  margin reduction and cost buildup in brazil  a  allowance against deferred taxes resulting from the india restructuring and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss of  resulting from the buyout of the interest rate swap  offset by management s cost reduction program 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the year ended january  for the three months ended january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating profit income before tax net income net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the net increase was comprised mainly of million in sales generated by our qualytextil  sa facility which was included in fy for the nine months following the acquisition  sales growth of million in china  domestic  asia pacific rim and other external sales  million in europe  million in increased reflective sales in the us  million increased sales of chemical protection clothing in the us  million increase in chile and million increase in india 
these growth areas were offset by decreases in sales of million in us disposables  million in u 
s gloves  million in us wovens and million in canada 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily due to the inclusion of qualytextil  sa sales in which operated at a margin for the nine months in fy in which brazil operations were included and in the prior year  a sales rebate program to meet competitive conditions resulting in a reduction in sales and higher tyvek fabric costs 
such higher tyvek costs resulted from tyvek purchased earlier with no rebate  charged to costs of goods sold for the months of april  may and into early june resulting in higher costs 
start up expenses included in gross profit related to the new foreign subsidiaries of approximately 
million which were partially offset by ongoing cost reduction programs in component and service purchasing  shifting production from the us to china and mexico  completion of the plant restructuring in mexico  rework expenses on a chemical suit contract and reduced volumes in lower margins in the us fire gear and gloves

operating profit 
operating profit increased by million  or  to million  from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  primarily due to the brazil acquisition  partially offset by increased operating expenses and lower volumes as discussed above 
interest expense

liquidity and capital resources management measures our liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operational funding needs and fund additional investments  including acquisitions 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures and access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital under satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation  together with currently available cash and investment and an ability to access credit lines if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and any increase in working capital that we would need to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we are actively seeking to expand by acquisitions as well as through organic growth of our business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional borrowings  equity financing or both  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms based  among other things  on our earnings performance and current financial position 
cash flows as of january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income of million and a decrease in inventories of million 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended january  of million was primarily due to net income of million offset by an increase in inventories of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to the acquisition of qualytextil in and purchases and improvements to property and equipment in and net cash used in and provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to an increased borrowing under our credit facilities primarily to fund the qualytextil acquisition in fy and primarily by repayment of borrowings as a result of decreased inventory levels in fy  respectively 
credit facilities we currently have one credit facility a one year  million revolving credit facility  of which we had borrowings outstanding as of january  amounting to million our million revolving credit facility expires on january  borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  as of january   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
our credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations  along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment and leasehold improvement  as well as payments related to the expansion of our facilities in brazil 
in fy  we expanded the current plant facility in brazil 
in fy  we added machinery and equipment in our newly rented weifang  china facility 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and  thus  chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to purchase our capital equipment which primarily consists of computer equipment and apparel manufacturing equipment 
contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period less than total year years years after years canada facility loan operating leases other liabilities revolving credit facility total note we renewed the mexico lease and rent for the next years at more than the past 
contingent commitment pursuant to the share purchase agreement relating to the company s purchase of qualytextil  sa in may  there is a provision dealing with a supplementary purchase price  based on a multiple of qualytextil s ebitda in see further description in note herein 
seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to moderate spring temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between december and may coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
with our acquisition of the brazilian facility and exclusive supply agreement with west farmers in australia  this seasonality may decrease as the south american mercosur markets  chile  australia  new zealand and south africa markets experience their high seasons during our slow summer months and their low season during our winter months 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which revises the accounting for vies by introducing a new consolidation model 
this new standard changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires companies to more frequently assess whether they must consolidate vies 
the new model identifies two primary characteristics of a controlling financial interest the power to direct significant activities of the vie  and the obligation to absorb losses of and or provide rights to receive benefits from the vie that are potentially significant to the vie 
in february  the fasb finalized an accounting standards update asu which defers the requirements of this standard for certain interests in investment funds and certain similar entities 
the adoption of this new standard on january  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  as substantially all of the entities in which it holds variable interests are anticipated to qualify for the scope deferral under the asu 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the amendments were issued to improve the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial statements  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
the amendments eliminate the concept of qualifying special purpose entities from gaap 
these entities will now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation criteria 
the amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after november  the adoption of the amended guidance is not expected to affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that provides amended disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after december  for certain disclosures and for reporting periods beginning after december  for other disclosures 
since these amended principles require only additional disclosures concerning fair value measurements  adoption will not affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which had been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has recently been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government and  therefore  we will be exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese raw material and component purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in brazil  canada  europe and  to a smaller extent  in other south american countries 
our sales to customers in brazil are denominated in brazilian reals  in canada in canadian dollars and in europe in euros and british pounds 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  the real  the pound or the euro  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange 
our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  however  our sales there were not affected this last year due to a steady exchange rate between the chinese rmb and the usd 
we manage the foreign currency risk through the use of rolling day forward contracts against the canadian dollar and chilean peso 
we do not hedge other currencies at this time 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the landed costs of our products into the us but would make our selling price for international sales more attractive with respect to foreign currencies 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased by a negligible effect
