item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the income statement and balance sheet data presented below have been derived from the company s consolidated financial statements 
on december   gldd acquisitions corp  the company s then parent corporation  merged with a subsidiary of aldabra 
aldabra was formed for the purpose of raising capital through an initial public offering with the intent to use the proceeds to merge with a business to build long term value 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger entered into on june   the stockholders of gldd acquisitions corp 
received  shares of aldabra common stock in exchange for all of gldd acquisitions corp 
s common and preferred equity 
aldabra then merged into an indirect wholly owned subsidiary and  in connection with this holding company merger  the stockholders of aldabra  including the former gldd acquisitions corp 
stockholders  received stock in a new holding company that was subsequently renamed great lakes dredge dock corporation 
the merger with aldabra was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
under this method of accounting  great lakes was the acquiring company for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the merger was treated as the equivalent of great lakes issuing stock for the net monetary assets of aldabra accompanied by a recapitalization 
the net monetary assets of aldabra  primarily cash  were stated at their fair value  which was equivalent to the carrying value  and accordingly no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded 
the following selected financial data as of and for the year ended december  reflects the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of gldd acquisition corp 
prior to the merger 
the accumulated deficit of gldd acquisition corp 
was carried forward to the recapitalized company 

table of contents prior to the merger in  the company had redeemable preferred stock 
dividends on the company s series a and series b preferred stock were cumulative semiannually and payable upon declaration at a rate of 
the preferred stock was recorded at its redemption and liquidation value of per share  or million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
prior to the merger  there was million in accumulated dividends outstanding 
the holders of preferred stock were entitled to payment before any capital distribution was made with respect to any junior securities and had no voting rights 
as a result of the merger on december   the preferred stock and accumulated dividends were exchanged for shares of aldabra stock 
the fair value of stock received was in excess of the carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock at the time of the exchange 
therefore  the net loss available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was adjusted by million in determining earnings per share 
the historical results prior to the merger date of december   were that of gldd acquisitions corp 
as noted the merger was considered a reverse acquisition  and therefore the weighted average shares outstanding for all prior periods were retroactively restated to reflect the shares that were issued to acquire gldd acquisitions corp common stock 
accordingly   were deemed to be outstanding at the beginning of the earliest period presented

capital expenditures in included the purchase of three vessels for million 
it also included the purchase of another vessel for million  funded through a sale leaseback transaction  as well as the buy out of certain equipment previously under operating leases for million 
capital expenditures in included approximately million spent to buy out certain equipment previously under operating leases and million related to the reconfiguration of a dredge into a material handling barge that was funded through a sale leaseback transaction

table of contents ebitda  as provided herein  represents net income loss attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation  adjusted for net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense 
the company presents ebitda as an additional measure by which to evaluate the company s operating trends 
the company believes that ebitda is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that all of the company s primary stakeholders ie its stockholders  bondholders and banks use ebitda to evaluate the company s period to period performance 
additionally  management believes that ebitda provides a transparent measure of the company s recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for this reason  the company uses a measure based upon ebitda to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the company s incentive plan 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  amounts determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap including a operating income as an indicator of operating performance  or b cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
as such  the company s use of ebitda  instead of a gaap measure  has limitations as an analytical tool  including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization  which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the company s business 
for these reasons  the company uses operating income to measure the company s operating performance and use ebitda only as a supplement 
the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss attributable to great lakes dredge and dock corporation year ended december  net income loss attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation adjusted for interest expense  net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization ebitda item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is the largest provider of dredging services in the united states 
in addition  the company is the only us dredging service provider with significant international operations  which represented approximately of the company s dredging revenues for  comparable to the company s three year average 
dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil  sand or rock 
the us dredging market consists of three primary types of work capital  beach nourishment and maintenance  in which sectors the company has experienced an average combined bid market share in the us of over the past three years  including  and of the capital  beach nourishment and maintenance sectors  respectively 
our bid market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic projects on which the company bids or could have bid if not for capacity constraints 
our fleet of dredges  of which are deployed internationally  material transportation barges  two drillboats  and numerous other specialized support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any us dredging company 
the mobility of the company s fleet enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities to employ its dredges 
the company estimates the replacement cost of the company s fleet to be in excess of billion in the current market 
our largest domestic dredging customer is the army corp of engineers corps which is responsible for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of us waterways 
our dredging revenues for earned from 
table of contents contracts with federal government agencies  including the corps as well as other federal entities such as the us coast guard and the us navy  was approximately  as compared with the company s three year average of 
the company also owns a majority interest in nasdi  a demolition service provider located in the boston  massachusetts area 
nasdi s principal services consist of interior and exterior demolition of commercial and industrial buildings  salvage and recycling of related materials  and removal of hazardous substances and materials 
the majority of nasdi s work has historically been performed in the new england area  however  nasdi is currently expanding into new york and other new england states 
in january  the company acquired a interest in yankee  a provider of environmental remediation services including asbestos abatement and removal of other hazardous materials for private and governmental entities 
prior to this acquisition  yankee served as a subcontractor on many nasdi projects 
the company has a ownership interest in amboy 
amboy s primary business is mining sand from the entrance channel to new york harbor in order to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and building construction 
together with the company s amboy joint venture partner  the company owns a interest in land that is adjacent to amboy s property and may be used in conjunction with amboy s operations 
our investment in amboy is accounted for using the equity method 
the company operates in two reportable segments dredging and demolition 
contract revenues most of the company s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the types of equipment required to perform the specified service and the estimated project duration affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid 
the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  based on the company s engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost to cost approach for demolition projects 
for dredging projects  costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project 
for demolition projects  contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation due to the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition 
the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues 
contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered  necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal 
significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project 
these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses 
costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  maintenance  insurance  and long term rentals  fuel  subcontracts  rentals  and project overhead 
hourly labor is generally hired on a project by project basis 
costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
generally  capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects  while beach nourishment projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to variability in weather conditions 
the company s cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs  including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term equipment rentals  averaging approximately to of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years 
during the year  both equipment utilization and the timing of cost expenditures fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  the company allocates these equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses 
specifically  at each interim 
table of contents reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on the company s dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis 
in the fourth quarter  any over and under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year 
as a result of this methodology  the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period 
primary factors that determine operating profitability dredging 
the company s results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors bid wins and dredge employment the company s dredging segment generates revenues when the company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project 
although the company s dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full time basis 
if a dredge is idle ie  the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle 
project and dredge mix the company s domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital  maintenance and beach nourishment work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work 
in addition  the company s dredging projects vary in duration and  in general  projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period 
moreover  the company s dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects 
accordingly  the company s dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities 
the company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross margin ie  gross profit divided by revenues for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges 
the company s expected gross margin for a project is based upon the company s estimates at the time of the bid 
although the company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin  the company cannot control the type of dredging projects that are bid from time to time  the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed 
as a result  in some quarters the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively high expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed and in other quarters  the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively low expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed 
project execution the company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with its project estimates 
in general  the company s ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including weather  variances from estimated project conditions  equipment mobilization time periods  unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the company s control 
if the company experiences any of these events and circumstances  the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed  as applicable  and  consequently  the company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates 
the company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control  however  these situations are inherent in dredging 
demolition 
the company s demolition segment generates revenues when the company is awarded a contract for demolition services and performs the project 
the company s revenues from its demolition segment increase or decrease based upon market demand 
like the company s dredging segment  results of operations for the company s demolition segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the company s ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the 
table of contents company bases the company s estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
percentage of completion method of revenue recognition the company s contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which is by its nature based on an estimation process 
for dredging projects  the company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion 
for demolition projects  the company uses estimates of remaining costs to complete to determine project percent complete 
in preparing the company s estimates  the company draws on the company s extensive experience in the dredging and demolition businesses and the company s database of historical information to assure that the company s estimates are as accurate as possible  given current circumstances 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance 
impairment of goodwill gaap requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because i goodwill is a material asset and ii the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
the company performs the company s annual impairment test as of july each year 
the company assesses the fair values of its reporting units using both a market approach and an income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future market growth trends  forecasted revenues and expenses  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the estimates are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value  and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual results differ from those estimates 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through comparison to comparable companies 
under the market approach  the company uses the guideline public company method by applying an estimated market based enterprise value multiples to the reporting unit s estimated revenue and ebitda 
the company analyzed companies that performed similar services or are considered competitors 
due to the fact that there are no public companies that are our direct competitors  the company weighed the results of this approach less than the income approach 
at december   the majority of goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by madison dearborn capital partners iv  lp on december  goodwill was allocated between the company s two reporting segments  dredging and demolition  based on the value assigned to each segment at that time 
at december  and  dredging goodwill was million in each year and demolition goodwill was million and million  respectively 
the increase in demolition goodwill was the result of the january  acquisition of yankee environmental services llc 
see note noncontrolling interest acquisitions to consolidated financial statements 
the company performed its annual test of impairment as of july  for the goodwill in both the dredging and demolition segments with no indication of goodwill impairment as of the test date 
the decline in the operating results and related cash flow forecasts in the demolition segment during the past year has reduced the amount by which the estimated fair value of the demolition segment exceeds the carrying value of the demolition segment s assets 
as of the measurement date  the fair value of the demolition segment was million above the carrying value 
a more than insignificant decline in the demolition segment s future operating results or cash flow forecasts versus the segment s current forecasts could potentially trigger a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
early in  the demolition 
table of contents segment was awarded over million of new projects  a significant portion of which are in the new york market  where it has been gaining a foothold 
no test was performed in the fourth quarter as based on the segment s current forecasts triggering events which would require a test were deemed to not have occurred 
the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis  and between annual tests if events or conditions result in a triggering event  thus requiring a test 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with gaap  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
our policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset s book value and fair market value 
our policy is to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows using financial projections that require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management 
changes in these projections may expose us to future impairment charges 
if a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs  the company would evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate 
self insurance reserves the company self insures costs associated with its seagoing employees covered by the provisions of jones act  workers compensation claims  hull and equipment liability  and general business liabilities up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that the company will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
in determining its estimates  the company considers historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
income taxes the company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
management believes it has adequately provided for uncertain tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
however  the company s future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire

the domestic bid market  a key measure of dredging activity in the us  was billion in  a increase from the bid market of million 
although  the stimulus had a positive impact on the market  there was an underlying need for many projects that spurred the market even before projects supported by the stimulus money were bid 
revenue and margins for the full year strengthened from prior years as a result of the increase in domestic activity  more than offsetting the slowdowns in both foreign operations and the demolition business 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over dredging revenues of million  due to a higher level of dredge deployment in in particular  the increase was the result of increased domestic dredging operations that more than offset decreased foreign dredging activity 
dredging gross margin was  up from in  primarily due to increased dredging revenues and project execution that was better than the company s estimates for certain projects  particularly in the first half of the year 
highlights from the company s primary dredging sectors are as follows revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of million in were up million  or  from revenues of this increase was driven by additional capital projects  including deepening work in the ports of new york  new jersey  jacksonville and tampa  florida and three coastal restoration projects in louisiana 
revenues from beach nourishment projects of million in decreased million  or  from million in beach revenues were negatively impacted throughout and the beginning of as state and local governments experienced delays in getting the necessary funding to put projects out to bid 
more beach work was bid and worked in the second half of revenues from maintenance dredging projects in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in this increase was due to the corps continuing to put out maintenance work that had long been delayed 
the company believes that many maintenance projects were supported by stimulus funding 
revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from revenues of million 
revenues decreased due to the postponement of a portion of the company s largest foreign project and declining middle eastern demand resulting from the global recession  instability in oil prices and the deterioration of the region s real estate market in and 
table of contents demolition revenues in were million  a decrease of million  or  over revenues of million 
as the construction and real estate development market continued to slow in  new project opportunities were scarce 
in addition  a few projects that had been worked on in were canceled in  resulting in write offs related to those projects 
moreover  several large demolition projects were worked on in and were not replaced in as a result  the demolition segment recorded negative gross profit margin of compared to gross profit margin of in dredging segment operating income for increased reaching million versus million in  as strong gross profit performance offset a increase in general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll and incentive costs  legal expenses and other costs related to the company s august secondary offering of stock 
in  the demolition segment produced an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million in due to weaker gross profit performance including write offs related to canceled projects 
demolition segment general and administrative expenses for of million decreased compared with million in primarily as a result of a decrease in incentive pay 
consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have been generally consistent  ranging between and of revenues over the last three years 
the company s net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million in while average debt levels were consistent year over year  lower interest rates decreased interest expense 
the company entered into new interest rate swap agreements in for which the company realized a million gain during the year 
in the company also realized a million gain on its former swap agreements 
the company incurred income tax expense of million compared with million in this million increase is primarily the result of the increase in the company s operating income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net income attributable to great lakes was million compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase was driven by higher operating income in as previously described 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over dredging revenues of million

revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of million in were up million  or  from revenues of this increase was driven by additional capital projects  including deepening work in the ports of new york  new jersey and boston  a deepening project in the columbia river in oregon  and two projects in the gulf of mexico 
revenues from beach nourishment projects of million decreased million  or  from million in beach revenues were negatively impacted throughout as state and local governments experienced delays in getting the necessary approvals to put projects out to bid 
revenues from maintenance dredging projects in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in this increase was due to the corps continuing to put out maintenance work  in addition to receiving emergency funds needed due to the flooding in the mississippi river and hurricanes in the gulf coast 

table of contents revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million an increase of million  or  from revenues of million 
revenues increased from as the company moved additional vessels to the middle east to work on several large land reclamation projects in bahrain 
demolition revenues were million  an increase of million  or  over revenues of million 
this increase was due to several large projects which were substantially completed by mid year 
a significant portion of the work on these projects included subcontract work  consequently nasdi s margins on these projects were not as high as nasdi typically generates 
gross profit of in the demolition segment was down from in due to the increase in subcontract work  a decrease in the price for scrap and the adverse impacts of project delays and a customer bankruptcy 
for the year ended december   consolidated general and administrative expenses totaled million  compared with million in  an increase of million  or  due to payroll and health care cost increases 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have been generally consistent  ranging between and of revenues over the last three years

in demolition operating income was million  on par with operating income of million despite nasdi s higher revenues 
the company s net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million in the impact of higher average debt levels during the year were more than offset by lower interest rates 
however  the company had an unrealized gain of million on the mark to market of its interest rate swap  compared to a million gain last year 
by virtue of a call provision contained in the swap agreements  the interest rate swaps were terminated by the company s counterparties in december the company incurred income tax expense of million compared with million in this million decrease is primarily the result of the company s reduced operating income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective rate was higher in as the company increased its federal deferred tax rate to 
this increase in the deferred tax rate resulted in deferred tax expense of million which increased the effective tax rate by 
for the year ended december   the company generated net income of million compared to million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net income was driven by decreased operating income in bidding activity and backlog the following table sets forth  by segment and type of dredging work  the company s backlog as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  december  backlog dredging capital us capital foreign beach nourishment maintenance demolition foreign backlog has been decreased for the portion of the diyar contract that became an option pending award in the first quarter of 
table of contents the company s contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
for dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site  the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work 
for demolition contracts  these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project 
however  these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty  subject to the company s right  in some cases  to recover the company s actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
in addition  the company s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the company is awarded from the bid market 
a quarterly increase or decrease of the company s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the company s business 
the company s backlog includes only those projects for which the company has obtained a signed contract with the customer

the domestic dredging bid market for was billion  a increase from the bid market of million 
maintenance work was the primary source of this increase  with million in awards  nearly double the market of million 
the company won contracts totaling million  or of the total bid domestic market  well above its five year average of  and million more than it won in the company s dredging backlog at december  totaled million  compared to million at december   reduced for the portion of the diyar contract that became an option in the first quarter of approximately million  or  of the company s year end dredging backlog consists of domestic capital dredging work  a substantial portion of which is expected to be performed in this level of capital backlog is higher than the prior year with the addition of deepening work in the ports of jacksonville  florida and mobile  alabama and the remaining work in the ports of new york and new jersey 
predominantly all of the capital work in backlog at the end of is federally funded 
beach nourishment backlog was million at the end of  a increase from million at the end of the beach nourishment bid market  which had been slow in and the first half of  improved in the second half of and totaled million  slightly above the average bid market over the last five years of million 
the company won million  over of the work that was bid 
maintenance backlog was million at the end of  more than twice the backlog of million at the end of as noted above  the maintenance bid market was million  which was above the five year average maintenance market of million  primarily because the corps received increased funding including stimulus monies to focus on maintenance work that had been deferred 
the company s share of the market was  on par with its historical share of over the last three years 
foreign capital backlog decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of  primarily as a result of the completion of projects that were in backlog at the end of and the slowdown in projects being bid and awarded 
demolition 
the company s demolition backlog at december  totaled million  a decrease from backlog of million at december  the demolition market has slowed as a result of the decreased activity in the construction and real estate development markets 
market outlook united states 
the water resources development act wrda is the primary vehicle for authorizing federal capital projects to deepen the nation s ports 
while wrda authorizes capital projects  the budgeting process appropriates annual funding for projects 
the president announced his budget for the fiscal year while it is down from the previous year  consistent with historical experience  this budget is likely to increase 
as discussions for 
table of contents next year s budget are starting early  there is a greater likelihood that a budget will be passed 
the corps is generally better able to bid and manage dredging work in fiscal years where the federal government operates under an approved budget  as opposed to a continuing resolution 
the bid market was bolstered by the stimulus 
the company believes that the majority of the work that is augmented by the stimulus has been awarded and an ample amount of this work will be completed by the dredging industry in while the stimulus supplemented the corps efforts to return our nation s channels to their stated depths  the company continues to believe that the long term solution for funding port maintenance involves the harbor maintenance trust fund hmtf initiative 
over the last years  the hmtf has collected tax revenue annually that was originally designated to fund harbor maintenance 
in recent years the gap between the amount collected under the tax and the amount allocated to harbor maintenance activities has grown significantly as the unallocated funds have been used for general budget purposes 
maintenance dredging in our nation s ports has been underfunded for several years  leaving many ports at considerably less than their authorized depths 
the maritime industry has formed an alliance that is working under the initiative referred to as ramp  or realize america s maritime promise  that continues to work toward assuring all future tax receipts collected under the hmtf will be spent on port maintenance projects 
through the efforts of ramp  congress has increasingly recognized the need to maintain our ports to enable more efficient movement of shipping traffic  thereby reducing costs and promoting economic growth 
the allocation of of the hmtf funds to their intended purpose should ensure our harbors are continually maintained at their authorized depths 
the company believes that a new wrda bill is likely to be introduced in the first half of with the hmtf legislation included 
although the company is hopeful for passage of this bill before the end of this summer  the number of the current legislative priorities in washington makes the timing uncertain 
the need to deepen us ports  and not just maintain them  is expected to become more important over the next several years as deeper draft cargo ships are being built and the panama canal expansion moves forward
