item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business salisbury bancorp  inc salisbury  a connecticut corporation  formed in  is the bank holding company for salisbury bank and trust company the bank  a connecticut chartered and federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic insured commercial bank headquartered in lakeville  connecticut 
salisbury s principal business consists of the business of the bank 
the bank  formed in  is engaged in customary banking activities  including general deposit taking and lending activities to both retail and commercial markets  and trust and wealth advisory services 
the bank conducts its banking business from eight full service offices in the towns of canaan  lakeville  salisbury and sharon  connecticut  south egremont and sheffield  massachusetts  and  dover plains and millerton  new york  and its trust and wealth advisory services from offices in lakeville  connecticut 
critical accounting policies and estimates salisbury s consolidated financial statements follow generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america as applied to the banking industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
salisbury s significant accounting policies are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  along with this management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating salisbury s reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet 
note describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis 
management evaluates goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually using valuation techniques that involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment giving consideration to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  estimates of future cash flows  delinquencies and default severity  and the intent and ability of salisbury to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the consideration of the above factors is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense

the decrease in the net interest margin was mostly due to the dilutive effect of carrying million in low yielding short term funds reflecting a more conservative liquidity management strategy during a year of heightened risk in the financial markets

the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the broad categories of the loan portfolio and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions 

table of contents december dollars in thousands a allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans real estate mortgages residential commercial construction  land land development home equity credit total mortgage loans commercial industrial consumer general unallocated total allowance a percent of loans in each category to total loans 
salisbury determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  current economic conditions and historical loan loss experience 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods  and therefore management takes a relatively long view of loan loss asset quality measures 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information that are often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in management s judgment  salisbury remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans at december the allowance for loan losses is computed by segregating the portfolio into various risk rating and product categories 
some loans have been further segregated and carry specific reserve amounts 
all other loans that do not have specific reserves assigned are reserved based on a loss percentage assigned to the outstanding balance 
the percentage applied to the outstanding balance varies depending on the loan s risk rating and product category  as well as present economic conditions  which have or may adversely affect the financial capacity and or collateral values supporting the loan 
management s loan risk rating assignments  loss percentages and specific reserves are subjected annually to an independent credit review by an external firm 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the fdic in february  and by the state of connecticut s department of banking in august  and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of these examinations

these loans are not included in the classification of nonaccrual or restructured loans above 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans

if the warrant were fully exercised  salisbury estimates that the ownership percentage of the current shareholders would be diluted by approximately percent 
dividends during  salisbury paid four quarterly common stock dividends of each  totaling  salisbury also paid  in preferred stock dividends to the us treasury 
on november   salisbury s board of directors announced that in response to changes in regulatory requirements it was changing the timing of future common stock dividend declarations  to coincide with quarterly earnings announcements 
dividends on its common stock  when declared  will generally be paid on or about the last business day of february  may  august and november  although salisbury is not obligated to pay dividends on those dates or at any other time 
accordingly  on february  salisbury s board of directors announced salisbury s financial results for the fourth quarter ended december  and announced the declaration of a common stock dividend of 
per common share payable on february  to shareholders of record on february  for the corresponding prior year period salisbury s board of directors announced a common stock dividend of 
per common share on november   payable on january   to shareholders of record on december   and announced salisbury s financial results for the fourth quarter ended december   on march  salisbury s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on the bank s ability to pay cash dividends to salisbury 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends and other payments by the bank to salisbury 
under connecticut law  the bank cannot declare a cash dividend except from net profits  defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations 
the total of all cash dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year shall not  unless specifically approved by the commissioner of banking  exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years 
frb supervisory letter sr  february   revised march   states that  as a general matter  the board of directors of a bank holding company bhc should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate  defer  or significantly reduce dividends if net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or the bhc will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
moreover  a bhc should inform the federal reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period eg  quarter for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bhc capital position 

table of contents further restrictions on cash dividends are imposed on salisbury because of salisbury s participation in the cpp 
these preclude the payment of any common stock cash dividends if salisbury is not paying the preferred stock dividend 
additionally  the common stock dividend may not be increased without prior approval from the treasury for the first three years salisbury is a cpp participant unless all cpp preferred shares are redeemed or transferred to third parties 
salisbury believes that the payment of common stock cash dividends is appropriate  provided that such payment considers salisbury s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of salisbury or the bank 
the continued payment of common stock cash dividends by salisbury will be dependent on salisbury s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of salisbury 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the corporation s financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices salisbury s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  over time  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of salisbury are monetary and as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on salisbury s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation  although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
although not a material factor in recent years  inflation could impact earnings in future periods 
forward looking statements this annual report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to such matters as a assumptions concerning future economic and business conditions and their effect on the economy in general and on the markets in which salisbury and the bank do business  and b expectations for revenues and earnings for salisbury and bank 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions rather than historical or current facts and  therefore  are inherently uncertain and subject to risk 
for those statements  salisbury claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation act of actual results could differ materially from management expectations  projections and estimates 
factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include  but are not limited to  the following a the risk of adverse changes in business conditions in the banking industry generally and in the specific markets in which the bank operates  b changes in the legislative and regulatory environment that negatively impacts salisbury and the bank through increased operating expenses  c increased competition from other financial and non financial institutions  d the impact of technological advances  and e other risks detailed from time to time in salisbury s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
such developments could have an adverse impact on salisbury s and the bank s financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s salisbury manages its exposure to interest rate risk through its asset liability management committee alco using risk limits and policy guidelines to manage assets and funding liabilities to produce financial results that are consistent with salisbury s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability targets 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings due to changes in interest rates 
the alco manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in salisbury s financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month horizon 
the simulations incorporate management s growth assumptions over the simulation horizons  with allowances made for loan  deposit and security product mix shifts in selected interest rate scenarios  such as movements between lower rate savings and money market deposit accounts and higher rate time deposits  and changes in the reinvestment of loan and securities cash flows 
additionally  the simulations take into account the specific re pricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
the alco reviews the simulation results to determine whether salisbury s exposure to change in net interest income remains within established tolerance levels over the simulation horizons and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
salisbury s tolerance levels for changes in net interest income in its income simulations varies depending on the magnitude of interest rate changes and level of risk based capital 
all changes are measured in comparison to the projected net interest income that would result from an unchanged rate scenario where interest rates remain stable over the forecast horizon 
the alco also evaluates the directional trends of net interest income  net interest margin and other financial measures over the forecast horizon for consistency with its liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability targets 

table of contents the alco uses four interest rate scenarios to evaluate interest risk exposure and may vary these interest rate scenarios to show the effect of steepening or flattening changes in yield curves as well as parallel changes in interest rates 
at december  the alco used the following interest rate scenarios unchanged interest rates  immediately rising interest rates immediate non parallel upward shift in market interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates to basis points for the year treasury  immediately falling interest rates immediate non parallel downward shift in market interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates to basis points for the year treasury  and gradually rising interest rates gradual non parallel upward shift in market interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates to basis points for the year treasury 
deposit rates are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their relative historical insensitivity to market interest rate movements 
further  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
because income simulations assume that salisbury s balance sheet will remain static over the simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
as of december  net interest income simulations indicated that salisbury s exposure to changing interest rates over the simulation horizons remained within its tolerance levels 
the following table sets forth the estimated change in net interest income from an unchanged interest rate scenario over the periods indicated for changes in market interest rates using salisbury s financial instruments as of december as of december  in thousands months months immediately rising interest rates immediately falling interest rates gradually rising interest rates the negative exposure of net interest income to immediately and gradually rising rates as compared to the unchanged rate scenario results from a faster projected rise in the cost of funds versus income from earning assets  as relatively rate sensitive money market and time deposits re price faster than longer duration earning assets 
the negative exposure of net interest income to immediately falling rates as compared to an unchanged rate scenario results from a greater decline in earning asset yields compared to rates paid on funding liabilities  as a result of faster prepayments on existing assets and lower reinvestment rates on future loans originated and securities purchased 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions and back tests simulation results to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk or future net interest margin 
over time  the re pricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments and the composition of salisbury s balance sheet may change to a different degree than estimated 
simulation modeling assumes a relatively static balance sheet that does not necessarily reflect salisbury s expectation for future balance sheet growth  which is a function of the business environment and customer behavior 
another significant simulation assumption is the sensitivity of core savings deposits to fluctuations in interest rates 
income simulation results assume that changes in both core savings deposit rates and balances are related to changes in short term interest rates 
the assumed relationship between short term interest rate changes and core deposit rate and balance changes used in income simulation may differ from the alco s estimates 
lastly  mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans involve a level of risk that unforeseen changes in prepayment speeds may cause related cash flows to vary significantly in differing rate environments 
such changes could affect the level of reinvestment risk associated with cash flow from these instruments  as well as their market value 
changes in prepayment speeds could also increase or decrease the amortization of premium or accretion of discounts related to such instruments  thereby affecting interest income 

table of contents salisbury also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in changing interest rate environments 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure that may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to salisbury s capital and liquidity position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
available for sale equity securities are excluded from this analysis because the market value of such securities cannot be directly correlated with changes in interest rates
