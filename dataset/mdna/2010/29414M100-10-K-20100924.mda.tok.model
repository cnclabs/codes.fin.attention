general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear in item of this report 
overview the economic crisis and the lack of available credit have impacted the company s operations during fiscal revenues for fiscal were  down from a record  in fiscal the reduction in revenues is mostly attributed to a reduction in large laundry equipment orders which offset revenue increases in all other product lines 
while the reduction in large contracts improved the company s gross profit margins from to and selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced by during this difficult period  net earnings for the year decreased by 
revenues for the year do not reflect the sale of a large installation made in our territory during the third quarter of fiscal  since the sale was made by a distributor in another territory  however  the company earned a substantial commission thereon 
the company s financial position remains strong with cash and cash equivalence growing by  to  and inventories reduced in line with current orders 
fiscal will be challenging if the economy remains weak and the lack of credit continues to negatively impact our operations 
but fiscal will also have its positive outlook as the company expanded its boiler product line and increased its sales staff 
in addition  the company expects to use some of its cash to increase leasing contracts  which will increase interest income and secure some orders which the company would normally lose due to credit issues 
liquidity and capital resources for the twelve month period ended june   cash increased by  compared to an increase of  during fiscal the following table summarizes the company s consolidated statement of cash flows years ended june  net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities for the twelve month period ended june   operating activities provided cash of  compared to  of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal two significant categories affecting cash in fiscal were an increase in cash due to a decrease of  in inventories  offset by a  reduction of cash due to a lower level of customer deposits 
inventories for the period were reduced in line with incoming orders and a decrease in backlog 
inventories are expected to increase as the economy and orders improve 
customer deposits decreased due to the shipments made in fiscal from the company s backlog while new orders trended lower than shipments 
in addition  cash was increased by the company s net earnings of  and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of  and a benefit of  in deferred income taxes  partially offset by the collection of a  accounts receivable whic h resulted in a reversal of a previously recognized bad debt expense 
cash was also contributed by a net reduction in income taxes of  and other assets of  an increase of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a  increase in accrued employee expenses partially offset by reductions in cash caused by an increase in accounts and trade notes receivable of  and the existence of leases and mortgage receivables of  it is expected that leases and mortgage receivables will increase in fiscal as the company seeks to invest its cash in higher interest producing transactions as a more effective use of its cash than bank interest 
the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of  in accounts and trade notes receivable and a decrease of  in inventories 
heavy shipments during june caused year end accounts and trade notes receivable to spike higher than normal  while at the same time inventories were increased to support a higher than normal backlog  which was shipped in fiscal cash was also increased by the company s net earnings of  and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of  bad debt expense of  and an increase in inventory reserves of  a reserve was placed against cancelled merchandise to better reflect market value 
these cash increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of  due to the reduced level of inventory buying and a decrease in customer deposits of  as new orders trended lower during the year 
in addition  cash was used due to decreases of  in accrued employee expenses and  in income taxes payable  a non cash benefit of  in deferred income taxes and increases in refundable income taxes of  and other current assets of  cash was also used as a result of a decrease of  in unearned income associated with the amortization of the initial fee received by the company from whirlpool corporation in january  which fee was fully amortized at december  investing activities used cash of  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  mostly for capital expenditures

however  all other product lines had sales increases over fiscal dry cleaning equipment sales rose by  boiler sales increased by and spare parts sales increased by 
the significant increase in boiler sales was attributed to a new and larger line of boilers which the company began to distribute at the beginning of fiscal foreign sales decreased by in fiscal when compared to fiscal development fees  franchise and licensing fees  commissions and other revenues increased by  for the year ended june  from fiscal the increase was mainly attributable to commission income received during the third quarter of fiscal on a sale by another distributor for an installation made in the company s territory
