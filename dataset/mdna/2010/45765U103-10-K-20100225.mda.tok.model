management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the results of operations for the year ended december  include the following items expenses of million  million net of tax  for professional fees and costs associated with our stock option review  gain on sale of a discontinued operation of million  million net of tax  foreign currency gains of million  million net of tax  and severance and restructuring expenses of million  million net of tax 
net of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the effective tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expense was recorded 
the majority of the goodwill impairment charges in emea and apac were non deductible and therefore had no tax effect 
on july   we acquired minx limited minx  a united kingdom based networking services company with annual net sales of approximately million  for a cash purchase price of approximately million and the assumption of approximately million of existing debt 
founded in  minx is a network integrator with cisco gold partner accreditation in the united kingdom 
we believe this acquisition has significantly enhanced our capabilities in the sale  implementation and management of network infrastructure services and solutions in our emea operating segment and complements our april  acquisition of calence in our north america operating segment 
on april   we completed the acquisition of calence  llc calence  one of the nation s largest independent technology solutions providers specializing in cisco networking solutions  advanced communications and managed services  for a cash purchase price of million plus a working capital adjustment of approximately million 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded an additional million and million  respectively  of purchase price consideration and million and  respectively  of accrued interest thereon as a result of calence achieving certain performance targets during each year 
such amounts were recorded as additional goodwill 
see discussion relating to goodwill in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we also assumed calence s existing debt totaling approximately million  of which million was repaid by us at closing in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements sales recognition sales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our usual sales terms are fob shipping point or equivalent  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client 
however  because we either i have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or ii have specifically stated fob destination contractual terms with the client  delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market  and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service 
on selected products  and for selected client service reasons  we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product 
we generally offer a limited to day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products  which are consistent with manufacturers terms  however  for some products we may charge the client restocking fees 
products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair  replacement or credit to us 
we resell most unopened products returned to us 
products that cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing  but are in working condition  are sold to inventory liquidators  to end users as previously sold or used products  or through other channels to reduce our losses from returned products 
we record freight billed to our clients as net sales and the related freight costs as costs of goods sold 
we report sales net of any sales based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with sales transactions 
revenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license  but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met ie  delivery  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
from time to time  the sale of hardware and software products may also include the provision of services and the associated contracts contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
sales of services currently represent a small percentage of our net sales  and a significant amount of services that are performed in conjunction with hardware and software sales are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product 
in these circumstances  net sales for the hardware  software and services are recognized upon delivery 
net sales of services that are performed at client locations are often service only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed and completed 
if the service is performed at a client location in conjunction with a hardware  software or other services sale  we recognize net sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria are satisfied the delivered item s has value to the client on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition  and thus are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
we determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker 
under gross sales recognition  the entire selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales  resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction  and there are no costs of goods sold 
additionally  we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis 
revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
partner funding we receive payments and credits from partners  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as a reduction to costs of goods sold 
partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated to inventories based on the applicable incentives from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the inventory is sold 
changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
starting in  we elected to primarily issue service based and performance based restricted stock units rsus 
the number of rsus ultimately awarded under performance based rsus varies based on whether we achieve certain financial results 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
for any stock options awarded  modifications to previous awards or awards of rsus that are tied to specified market conditions  we use option pricing models or lattice binomial models to determine fair value of the awards 
the estimated fair value of stock options is determined on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on evaluation of the aging of the receivables  historical write offs and the current economic environment 
should our clients or vendors circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment  our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares that value to the carrying value 
such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  and appropriate discount rates 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of every year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations 
any adverse change in these factors  among others  could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
when two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics  the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if the segment comprises only a single component 
insight has three reporting units  which are equivalent to our operating segments 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value  including goodwill 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit  including the market and income approaches 
all of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment  or both 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the company  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of the all of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
in step two of the analysis  we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets  such as trademarks 
management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
see further information on the carrying value of goodwill and the impairment charges recorded in in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
severance and restructuring activities we have taken  and may continue to take  severance and restructuring actions which require us to utilize significant estimates related primarily to employee termination benefits  estimated costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expenses in subsequent periods would be necessary 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
effective january   any change in a valuation allowance established in purchase accounting will be a benefit to  or charge against  earnings 
additional information about the valuation allowance can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
where appropriate  we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
additional information about contingencies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

the decline in software sales year over year primarily relates to program changes with our largest software partner 
the increase in services net sales is primarily due to several large professional services engagements during the year ended december   particularly a large professional services engagement that spanned the last three quarters of the year

these results reflect the challenging global it demand environment as well as the previously announced changes in programs with our largest software partner 
the year over year improvement in sales of services primarily resulted from the contribution of minx limited a networking solutions provider  acquired in july our apac segment recognized net sales of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the previously announced changes in programs with our largest software partner  offset by increased public sector spending in australia

gross profit on services net sales contributed basis points to the increase in margin year over year  reflecting the several large professional services engagements during the year ended december  discussed above  and gross profit generated by freight contributed basis points to the increase in margin year over year 
in addition  the extinguishment of million of certain restatement related trade credits during the year ended december   through negotiated settlement or other legal release of the recorded liabilities  contributed basis points to the increase in margin 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in agency fees for enterprise software agreement renewals of basis points and market pricing pressures which have driven decreases in product margin  which includes partner funding  of basis points

net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including the period end remeasurement of intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change from net foreign currency exchange losses in the prior year to a modest gain in the current year is due primarily to less volatility in the applicable exchange rates and the effects of our use of foreign exchange forward contracts in to hedge certain non functional currency assets and liabilities against changes in exchange rate movements

emea s selling and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to salaries and wages  employee related expenses and contract labor  which increased due to increases in sales incentive programs  increases in recruitment costs and employee headcount

the effect of currency exchange rates between the us dollar as compared to the various european currencies in which we do business accounted for approximately million of the net year over year increase

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued apac s selling and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the hiring of experienced software sales and support teammates during the first quarter of goodwill impairment 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge during the year ended december  of million  which represented the entire goodwill balance recorded in all three of our operating segments as of december  the goodwill impairment charge in north america in the second quarter of was a result of the deteriorating economic environment  particularly its effect on our legacy hardware business  which contributed to lower than expected net sales and caused management to reassess our expectations about future domestic market growth 
by the fourth quarter of  the effects of the global recession were negatively affecting our results of operations in all of our operating segments  indicating a need for management to again reassess projections of future domestic and foreign market growth  leading to the incremental goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in all three of our operating segments

non operating income expense 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the increase in interest income year over year is due to improved cash management  partially offset by decreases in interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities 
interest expense remained relatively flat from to as a result of the increase in the weighted average borrowings outstanding subsequent to the acquisition of calence  offset by decreases in interest rates on the refinanced debt in in conjunction with our refinancing of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility on april  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item if this report  we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of  in the second quarter of to write off a portion of our deferred financing fees to interest expense 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including the period end remeasurement of intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the net foreign currency exchange loss in is due primarily to increases in the volume of software licenses sold in various foreign currencies and procured in us dollars  changes in intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries and the volatility of the related foreign currency exchange rates  specifically the canadian dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities 
income tax expense 
our income tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the change from expense in to a benefit in was primarily the result of the impairment charge related to deductible goodwill during that resulted in a pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year ended december

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued earnings from discontinued operations 
on march   we completed the sale of pc wholesale

liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth for the periods presented certain consolidated cash flow information for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities foreign currency exchange effect on cash flow increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year cash and cash flow our primary uses of cash during were to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures  to pay down debt and to fund the first two payments  in april and november  of the additional purchase price consideration and accrued interest thereon as a result of calence achieving certain performance targets subsequent to the acquisition 
operating activities provided million in cash  a decrease from the year ended december  our operating cash flows enabled us to reduce our long term debt under our revolving credit facilities by million and fund the million of additional purchase price consideration to the former owners of calence  while still increasing cash and cash equivalent balances by million since december  capital expenditures were million for the year  a decrease from due primarily to the completion of our it systems upgrade project in north america in late additionally  benefited from a million positive effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash flow while was burdened by an million negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash flow 
during the year ended december   we recorded earnings from a discontinued operation of million  million net of tax  as a result of the favorable settlement on july  of an arbitrated claim related to the sale of direct alliance  a former subsidiary that was sold on june  since this amount had been deferred as of the original sale date in  the settlement in resulted in no cash flows to insight related to the recognition of the non cash gain 
we sold pc wholesale in march and have presented it as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations 
excluding net earnings  amounts related to the discontinued operation have not been removed from the statement of cash flows because the effect is immaterial 
net cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  reflect our net earnings  adjusted for depreciation  amortization  non cash stock based compensation expense  write downs of inventories  the provision for losses on accounts receivable  the non cash gain from the direct alliance arbitrated claim and deferred income taxes 
also contributing to the cash flows from operating activities were increases in deferred revenue and decreases in accounts receivable 
the decreases in accounts receivable reflect the decrease in net sales compared to the prior year as well as our focus on cash management 
these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable in the normal course of business 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our net loss before the non cash goodwill impairment charge  including the resulting increase in deferred tax assets associated with the goodwill impairment charge  and before depreciation and amortization 
also contributing to the cash flows from operating activities were decreases in accounts receivable and other current assets  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable in the normal course of business 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our net earnings before depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable 
these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable can be primarily attributed to an increase in net sales  and the related costs of goods sold 
the higher accounts receivable balance at december  compared to december  can be primarily attributed to an increase in net sales as well as to a slowdown in collections in our north american and emea operations due to internal collection productivity issues and slower customer payments

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our consolidated cash flow operating metrics as of december   and are as follows days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos a days inventory outstanding excluding inventories not available for sale b days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable dpos c a calculated as the balance of accounts receivable  net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales 
daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by days 
b calculated as average inventories divided by daily costs of goods sold 
average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two 
daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by days 
c calculated as the balances of accounts payable  which includes the inventory financing facility  at the end of the period divided by daily costs of goods sold 
daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by days 
dsos decreased slightly for the quarter ended december  compared to the quarter ended december  in north america  reductions in past due accounts receivable balances as a percent of total accounts receivable were offset by the effects of a higher percentage of accounts receivable subject to longer payment terms  resulting in fairly flat performance 
these results were offset by a reduction in dsos in our emea and apac segments due primarily to the timing of sales and collections occurring earlier in the quarter compared to the prior year period 
days inventory outstanding decreased from year to year as we realized the benefits of our focus in on improving our purchasing efficiency 
dpos increased slightly during the fourth quarter of reflecting the expanded use of our inventory financing facility in the quarter compared to the same quarter in the increase in dsos from the quarter ended december  to the quarter ended december  resulted from the increase in the proportion of consolidated net sales in our foreign operations  which have generally longer payment terms 
the increase in dpos from the quarter ended december  to the quarter ended december  is driven primarily by enhanced management of working capital  including the establishment of a new inventory financing facility  which provides for interest free inventory purchases as long as the accounts payable are paid within extended stated vendor terms ranging from to days 
these operating metrics include the effect of the calence acquisition in higher accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at december  compared to december  we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts 
we intend to use cash generated in in excess of working capital needs to pay down our outstanding debt balances and support our capital expenditures for the year 
also  we expect to complete our work to gain compliance under state unclaimed property programs in early and as a result  we expect to make cash payments to settle trade credit liabilities of approximately to million in net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily related to investments to upgrade our it systems 
capital expenditures during primarily related to expenditures to upgrade our it systems in emea 
we expect total capital expenditures in to be between million and million  primarily for the it systems upgrade in our emea operations and other facility and technology related maintenance and upgrade projects 
during the year ended december   we made payments totaling million to the former owners of calence for additional purchase price consideration and the related accrued interest thereon as a result of calence achieving certain performance targets during and during the year ended december   we made a payment of  to resolve certain post closing contingencies related to the sale of a discontinued operation 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from the sale of a discontinued operation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net cash provided by used in financing activities 
during the year ended december   we made net repayments on our debt facilities that reduced our outstanding debt balances under our revolving credit facility by million 
as of december   the only current portion of our long term debt relates to our new capital lease obligation for certain it equipment 
during the year ended december   we had a net increase in our obligations under our inventory financing facility of million  which is included in accounts payable 
during the year ended december   we increased our outstanding debt by million and subsequent to the acquisition of calence on april   had a net increase in our obligations under our new inventory financing facility of million 
these positive cash flows in were partially offset by the funding of million of repurchases of our common stock and the repayment of million of debt assumed in the acquisitions of calence and minx during during the year ended december   we reduced our outstanding debt by million and funded repurchases of million of our common stock 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock plans 
as of december   our long term debt balance consisted of million outstanding under our million senior revolving credit facility 
our objective is to pay our debt balances down as quickly as possible while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives 
the one year term of our million accounts receivable securitization financing facility the abs facility expires on july  we currently anticipate that we will be able to renew the abs facility prior to its maturity 
no amounts were outstanding under the abs facility as of december   and as such  we had no current debt on our balance sheet as of december  other than the current portion of our capital lease obligation of  we utilize the abs facility primarily to meet short term  seasonal spikes in our working capital needs and expect that we will continue using the facility to meet those needs in the most significant seasonal spike occurs in july of each year as a result of payments due to our largest supplier for purchases occurring primarily in june 
we believe that the current availability under our abs facility along with capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the anticipated seasonal spike in cash needs 
as our operations generate cash  we are typically able to begin paying down debt within a few days of the seasonal spike 
if we were unable to renew our abs facility in  we believe that cash flows from operations and extending payment terms with key partners by foregoing early pay discounts  together with the funds available under our existing long term senior revolving credit facility  will be adequate to support our anticipated working capital requirements for operations over the next twelve months 
additionally  we may be able to support our working capital needs by negotiating extended payment terms with our largest supplier and exercising our option to expand the size of our senior revolving credit facility  however  this expansion would likely result in significantly higher costs for the facility compared to the favorable rates in effect today 
our borrowing capacity under our abs facility is limited by the value and quality of the accounts receivable under the facility 
on july   we amended our abs facility  which was to have expired on september   to  among other changes  i add software receivables from the legacy software spectrum business as eligible receivables under the facility  ii reduce our eligible receivables under the facility to reflect our accounts receivable related trade credit liabilities as well as certain other accounts receivable related to sales where revenue recognition from the sale has been deferred  iii establish a new day term ending july  and iv increase the variable interest rate by approximately basis points for funds provided under the abs facility  calculated as the specified pooled commercial paper rate  as defined in the abs facility  plus 
the million maximum borrowing capacity and the maximum leverage  minimum fixed charge and minimum asset coverage ratio financial covenant requirements under the abs facility were not modified as part of the amendment 
while the abs facility has a stated maximum amount  the actual availability under the facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable  which reduced the maximum borrowing capacity from million to million as of december  our consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our senior revolving credit facility and our abs facility is limited by certain financial covenants  particularly a maximum leverage ratio 
the maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the company s trailing twelve month net earnings loss plus i interest expense  less non cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility  ii income tax expense benefit  iii depreciation and amortization  iv non cash goodwill impairment and v non cash stock based compensation referred to herein as adjusted earnings 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the agreements is times trailing twelve month adjusted earnings 
we anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements over the next four quarters 
however  a significant drop in adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter  to a level that would be below the company s consolidated maximum debt capacity 
as a result of this limitation  of the million of aggregate maximum debt capacity available under our senior revolving credit facility and our abs facility  the company s debt balance that could have been outstanding as of december  was limited to million based on times the company s trailing twelve month adjusted earnings 
our debt balance as of december  was only million  including our capital lease obligation  well below the quarter end limitation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we anticipate that cash flows from operations  together with the funds available under our financing facilities will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations over the next months 
cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us for foreign entities not treated as branches for us tax purposes  we do not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the us as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries where we consider undistributed earnings for these foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
as part of our working capital management strategy  we used our excess cash balances in the united states to pay down debt as of december  as of december   the majority of our foreign cash resides in canada  australia  the united kingdom and the netherlands 
certain of these cash balances could and will be remitted to the us by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business 
this repayment would not change our policy to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be indefinitely invested outside of the us were approximately million at december  undistributed earnings will be used for general business purposes in the foreign jurisdictions as well as to fund our emea it system  various facility upgrades and the hardware expansion to non uk emea countries 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through september  during the year ended december   we purchased million shares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of per share  which represented the full amount authorized under the repurchase program

although we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive  we have no material contractual purchase obligations 
acquisitions our strategy may include the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or some combination of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure 
we do not believe that the effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our financing facilities expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable

net foreign currency transaction gains losses  including transaction gains losses on intercompany balances that are not of a long term investment nature  are reported as a separate component of non operating income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency which expose us to foreign exchange rate movements 
remeasurement of these cash balances results in gains losses that are also reported as a separate component of non operating income expense 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and have begun to enter  selectively  into forward exchange contracts to mitigate risk associated with certain non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities related to foreign denominated payables  receivables  and cash balances
