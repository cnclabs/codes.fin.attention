critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements goodwill the company evaluates goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives not being amortized for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
indicators at the company included but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  a decrease in the company s market capitalization below its book value and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  the company performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if impairment is identified  the company measures and records the amount of impairment losses 
the company performs this annual analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
impairment indicators at the company include  but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  a decrease in the company s market capitalization below its book value and an expectation that a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 

table of contents if one or more indicators of impairment exist  the company performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if impairment is identified  the company measures and records the amount of impairment losses 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company utilized an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the company s fourth quarter during and  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of two methods quoted market price and discounted cash flow 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate an impairment charge 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the fair value of the reporting unit allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with the acquired businesses is impaired 
additionally  as the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value  our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition hearusa has company owned centers in its core markets and a network of affiliated providers who provide products and services to customers that are located outside its core markets 
hearusa enters into provider agreements with benefit providers third party payors such as insurance companies  managed care companies  employer groups  etc 
under a a discount arrangement on products and service  b a fee for service arrangement  and c a per capita basis or capitation arrangement  which is a fixed per member per month fee received from the benefit providers 
all contracts are for one calendar year and are usually cancelable with ninety days or less notice by either party 
under the discount arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members of a benefit provider at a pre determined discount or customary price and the member pays the company directly for the products and services 
under the fee for service arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members at its customary price less the benefit they are allowed a specific dollar amount  which the member pays directly to the company 
the company then bills the benefit provider the agreed upon benefit for the service 
under the capitation agreements  the company agrees with the benefit provider to provide their eligible members with a pre determined discount 
revenue under capitation agreements is derived from the sales of products and services to members of the plan and from a capitation fee paid to the company by the benefit provider at the beginning of each month 
the members that are purchasing products and services pay the customary price less the pre determined discount 
this revenue from the sales of products to these members is recorded at the customary price less applicable discount in the period that the product is delivered 
the direct expenses consisting primarily of the cost of goods sold and commissions on sales are recorded in the same period 
other indirect operating expenses are recorded in the period which they are incurred 

table of contents the capitation fee revenue is calculated based on the total members in the benefit provider s plan at the beginning of each month and is non refundable 
only a small percentage of these members may ever purchase product or services from the company 
the capitation fee revenue is earned as a result of agreeing to provide services to members without regard to the actual amount of service provided 
that revenue is recorded monthly in the period that the company has agreed to see any eligible members 
the company records each transaction at its customary price for the three types of arrangements  less any applicable discounts from the arrangements in the center business segment 
the products sold are recorded under the hearing aids and other products line item and the services are recorded under the service line item on the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue and expense are recorded when the product has been delivered  net of an estimate for return allowances 
revenue and expense from services and repairs are recorded when the services or repairs have been performed 
capitation revenue is recorded as revenue from hearing aids since it relates to the discount given to the members 
revenues are considered earned by the company at the time delivery of product or services have been provided to its customers when the company is entitled to the benefits of the revenues 
when the arrangements are related to members of benefit providers that are located outside the company owned centers territories  the revenues generated under these arrangements are included under the network business segment 
the company records a receivable for the amounts due from the benefit providers and a payable for the amounts owed to the affiliated providers 
the company only pays the affiliated provider when the funds are received from the benefit provider 
the company records revenue equal to the minimal fee for processing and administrative fees 
the costs associated with these services are operating costs  mostly for the labor of the network support staff and are recorded when incurred 
no contract costs are capitalized by the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per aging categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the needed allowance 
any change in the percent assumptions per plan and aging categories results in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent applied against the remaining receivables would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company offers all its customers a full day return period or the return period applicable to state guidelines 
for patients who participate in the family hearing counseling program  the return period is extended to days 
under the aarp program  patients who are members of aarp have a return period of days if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
currently we have not experienced any events that would indicate a potential impairment of these assets  but if circumstances change we could be required to record a loss for the impairment of long lived assets 

table of contents stock based compensation share based payments are accounted for using fair value in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
the expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a historical volatility of our common stock for a period at least equal to the expected term 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
both the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to establish a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
although we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used  if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions  the balances of the deferred tax assets  liabilities and valuation allowance could be significantly different 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures asu 
asu amends the guidance on fair value measurement disclosures to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of the level and categories in the fair value measurement hierarchy  as well as separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
the amended guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the new requirements for disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activities in level fair value measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of the amended guidance on fair value measurement related disclosures will require significant additional disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
in december  the fasb issued asu  improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu 
asu provides amendments to asc to reflect the revised guidance 
the amendments in asu replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a vie with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and i the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or ii the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the amendments in asu also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement with vies 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations or require additional disclosure
