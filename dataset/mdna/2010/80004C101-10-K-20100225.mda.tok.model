our mission is to provide simple  reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices 
we sell our products globally through broad retail and oem distribution channels 
we design  develop and manufacture data storage products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  proprietary controller and firmware technologies 
we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash memory supply requirements through our significant flash venture relationships with toshiba which provide us with leading edge  low cost memory wafers 
our removable card products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones  digital cameras  gaming devices and laptop computers 
our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones  navigation devices  gaming systems  imaging devices and computing platforms 
for computing platforms  we provide high speed  high capacity storage solutions known as ssds that can be used in lieu of hard disk drives in a variety of computing devices 

table of contents our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
we believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic 
accordingly  we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices  consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and or units of memory and that over time  new markets will emerge 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products  we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte  and the average capacity and or the number of units of our products must grow enough to offset price declines 
we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements  primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon 
effective december   we implemented a change in accounting and have separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our senior convertible note due that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost 
accordingly  we bifurcated the debt into debt and equity components and are amortizing the debt discount the economic interest cost in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have retrospectively applied the change in accounting to all periods presented  and have recast the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and presented in this report 
effective december   we implemented a change in accounting and have reclassified for all periods presented non controlling interests  formerly called a minority interest  to a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets  and the net income loss attributable to non controlling interests has been separately identified in the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of equity 
the company has also reclassified certain distributions to non controlling interests from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities for fiscal years ended december  and december  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we identified that our third party equity software contained a feature that resulted in incorrect share based compensation expense 
this software feature affected our share based compensation expense reported for the nine months ended september  and the three fiscal years ended december  we determined that the impact of the underreported share based compensation expense was not material to any of the previously issued annual or interim financial statements 
accordingly  the fourth quarter and full fiscal year include a cumulative non cash adjustment of million to increase share based compensation  allocated to multiple expense categories 
fiscal year included weeks as compared to weeks in fiscal years and critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies  share based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  there is transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at january  and december   deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in calculating the value of sales incentive programs  actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers 
the timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues 
in addition  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on hand and on noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us and certain foreign net deferred tax assets as there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence  complexity of the matter  available federal tax case law  interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates 
there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and equity method investments 
we perform tests for impairment of long lived and intangible assets and equity method investments whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment of long lived and intangible assets are only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
an impairment of an equity method investment is deemed to occur if the fair value  based upon quoted market prices if available or forecasted discounted cash flows  is less than the carrying value 
substantially all of our equity method investments are not actively traded and we rely on discounted cash flows to estimate fair value 
these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
fair value of investments in debt instruments 
there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  investments and fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level securities represent quoted prices in active markets  and therefore do not require significant management judgment 
our level securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  and other similar data  which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices  or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information  compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information 
in the current market environment  the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 
however  given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio  and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets  we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions was material to the valuation of our cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities 
we currently do not have any investments that use level inputs

table of contents license and royalty revenues 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages license and royalty revenues the decrease in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues was due to lower flash memory revenues reported by our licensees and a new license agreement with an existing licensee at a lower effective royalty rate as compared to the previous license agreement 
these declines were partially offset by fiscal year including a full year of royalty revenue for new licensees added in fiscal year the increase in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues was primarily due to the addition of new licensees 
gross margins 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages product gross profit loss product gross margins as a percent of product revenue total gross margins as a percent of total revenue product gross margins in fiscal year increased percentage points compared to fiscal year due to manufacturing costs declining faster than prices and a net benefit of million  primarily from the sale of inventory which had been previously partially reserved in fiscal year to reflect the market value of certain inventory which was determined to be below cost 
the increase in product gross margin in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was also due to charges in for the impairment of our investments in flash ventures of million and for adverse purchase commitments of million associated with under utilization of flash ventures capacity 
the rate of decline in average selling price per gigabyte slowed in fiscal year due to an improved balance between supply and demand  impacted in part by our actions in early fiscal year to sell a portion of our manufacturing capacity in flash ventures to toshiba  and hold the remaining wafer output capacity constant 
the rate of cost decline of our memory products was similar in fiscal years and product gross margins in fiscal year decreased percentage points compared to fiscal year primarily due to aggressive industry price declines resulting in the sale of products at negative gross margins and related charges 
the related charges in fiscal year included inventory reserves primarily to reduce the carrying value to the lower of cost or market for both inventory on hand and in the channel of million 
charges of million for adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of flash ventures capacity for the day period in which we have non cancellable orders

provision for income taxes 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages provision for income taxes effective income tax rates our fiscal year effective tax rate was primarily related to withholding taxes on license and royalty income from certain foreign licensees and income tax provisions recorded by foreign subsidiaries while income taxes for federal and state were substantially offset by the reduction of valuation allowance related to the utilization of tax credits 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain us and foreign gross deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance significantly increased due primarily to the size of the fiscal year net loss and that it is not more likely than not that certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
fiscal year provision for income taxes was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non deductible share based compensation expenses and certain foreign losses partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at other than us rates and tax exempt interest 
our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in october  the internal revenue service commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through we do not expect a resolution to be reached during the next twelve months

management also uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  and not as a replacement for  data presented in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of non gaap measures  including net income loss and non gaap net income loss per diluted share  provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company s results of operations 
management believes that the use of these non gaap financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports 
management has historically used these non gaap measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past  present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations 
externally  we believe that these non gaap measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company 

table of contents internally  these non gaap measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the company  establishing internal budgets  setting and determining variable compensation levels  calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives  comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models  strategic planning  and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors 
we exclude the following items from our non gaap measures share based compensation expense 
these expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options  employee restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan 
although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of sandisk s employees and executives  we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results 
further  we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies 
impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets 
this item reflects the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets to their fair values 
because of the infrequent nature of this charge  management does not include this type of item in internal operating forecasts and models 
excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare our core operating results in different periods without this variability 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
we incur amortization of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions 
since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle  we exclude these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods 
inventory step up expense related to msystems acquisition 
this is an acquisition related charge 
it results from marking to fair value an acquired company s inventory at the time of acquisition 
this charge is not factored into management s evaluation of potential acquisitions or our performance after completion of acquisitions  because it is not related to our core operating performance  and the frequency and amount of this type of charge can vary significantly based on the size and timing of our acquisitions 
excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare the company against the performance of other companies without this variability 
convertible debt interest 
this is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of the convertible debt 
the value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest rate method 
we exclude this non cash interest expense as it does not represent the semi annual cash interest payments made to our note holders 
income tax adjustments 
this amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis  considering jurisdictional tax rates  consistent with the presentation of non gaap net income 
it also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record  considering jurisdictional tax rates  if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
from time to time in the future  there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management 

table of contents limitations of relying on non gaap financial measures 
we have incurred and will incur in the future  many of the costs excluded from the non gaap measures  including share based compensation expense  impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs  convertible debt interest expense and income tax adjustments 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
these non gaap measures may be different than the non gaap measures used by other companies

cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operations of million for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from our net income of million compared with a net loss of billion  which included non cash impairment charges  in the comparable period of the prior year 
cash flow from accounts receivable decreased  as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year compared with the prior year  due to increased revenue in fiscal year cash used for inventory decreased primarily due to higher sales 
cash flow from other assets increased compared with the prior year primarily due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of fiscal year related to carryback claims from the fiscal year net loss 
accounts payable trade and accounts payable from related parties decreased primarily due to the reduction of gross inventory  operating expenses and the timing of flash ventures payments as compared to the prior year  resulting in a decrease in cash provided 
cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of settlements in hedge contracts and the elimination of liabilities for flash ventures adverse purchase commitments associated with under utilization of flash ventures capacity 
cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operations of million for fiscal year the decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from our net loss of billion offset by non cash impairments 
cash flow from accounts receivable in fiscal year was positively impacted by increased collection efforts and by reduced product accounts receivable levels as compared with the prior year period 
the increase in inventory was related primarily to the expansion of capacity and production at flash ventures while revenue from our products declined from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in other assets was due to the increase in tax receivables related to tax refunds expected on carryback claims due to the fiscal year net loss 
within operating activities for fiscal year  there was an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in related parties payables due to timing of flash ventures payments at fiscal year year end  an increase in other liabilities related to flash ventures capacity under utilization accrual  timing of the cash settlement of outstanding hedge contracts  and lower deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers related to lower revenue levels 

table of contents investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to lower proceeds from sale and maturities of short and long term marketable securities  offset by a reduction in the net loans made to flash ventures and a reduced investment in property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we loaned million to flash ventures for equipment purchases and received million on the collection of outstanding notes receivable from flash ventures for the sale of a portion of our production capacity and the return of excess cash from flash partners 
this resulted in a net loan repayment from flash ventures of million in fiscal year compared to a loan of million to flash ventures for equipment purchases in fiscal year cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of billion in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by investing was primarily related to reduced purchases of short and long term marketable securities due to our higher liquidity requirements and the return of million on our investment in flashvision and million from the sale of millimeter fab equipment that we owned directly as compared to the return of million from flashvision in the fiscal year usage of cash for investments in and loans to flash partners and flash alliance was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year was primarily due to the repayment of debt financing in fiscal year of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million as compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal year was primarily related to lower cash proceeds from employee stock programs and repayment of debt financing in fiscal year offset by the termination of the share repurchase programs which used cash in fiscal year liquid assets 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of billion 
we have billion of long term marketable securities which we believe are also liquid assets  but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of the marketable security being greater than one year 
short term liquidity 
as of january   our working capital balance was billion 
we expect our loans to flash ventures as well as our investments in property  plant and equipment to be approximately million to million in fiscal year on february   we notified the holders of our convertible notes due that we would exercise our option to redeem the million outstanding on march  the redemption price will be  per  principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued interest  for an aggregate cash expenditure of million plus accrued interest of million 
our short term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding flash ventures master lease agreements 
the flash ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor  including  among other things  our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least billion  and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of bb from s p  or moody s corporation  or a minimum corporate rating of bb from r i 
as of january   flash ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants 
while our s p credit rating was b  two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from s p  our r i credit rating was bbb  one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from r i 

table of contents if r i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold  flash ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements 
such resolution could include  among other things  supplementary security to be supplied by us  as guarantor  or increased interest rates or waiver fees  should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances 
if a resolution was unsuccessful  we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire billion outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantee under such flash ventures master lease agreements  based upon the exchange rate at january   which could negatively impact our short term liquidity 
long term requirements 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future 
we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
financing arrangements 
at january   we had billion of aggregate principal amount in convertible notes outstanding  consisting of billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due our convertible notes due may be redeemed in whole or in part by the holders thereof at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest on march  and various dates thereafter 
on february   we notified the holders of our convertible notes due that we would exercise our option to redeem the million outstanding on march  the redemption price will be  per  principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued interest  for an aggregate cash expenditure of million plus accrued interest of million 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior convertible notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as of january   the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire in august at expiration  we may  at our option  elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis 
as of january   the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding 
in addition  counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due in full  at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the senior convertible notes due or the first day that none of the senior convertible notes due remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due as of january   we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement

table of contents flash partners and flash alliance ventures with toshiba 
we are a owner in both flash partners and flash alliance  or hereinafter collectively referred to as flash ventures  our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products 
these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash ventures 
this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba 
flash ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures nand wafer supply or to pay for of the fixed costs of flash ventures 
we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers 
see note  related parties and strategic investments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from flash ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues 
flash ventures are variable interest entities  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture 
accordingly  we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
under flash ventures agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our requirement to fund common research and development activities ended and final funding was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year as of january  and december   we accrued liabilities related to these expenses of zero and million  respectively 
we continue to participate in other common research and development activities with toshiba but are not committed to any minimum funding level 
for semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flash ventures  we and toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis  of the outstanding flash ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from december through december these master lease obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable 
our total master lease obligation guarantee  net of lease payments  as of january   was billion japanese yen  or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at january  in our fiscal year  we and toshiba restructured flash ventures by selling more than of flash ventures capacity to toshiba 
the restructuring resulted in us receiving value of billion japanese yen of which billion japanese yen  or million  was received in cash  reducing outstanding notes receivable from flash ventures and billion japanese yen of value reflected the transfer of off balance sheet equipment lease guarantee obligations from us to toshiba 
the restructuring was completed in a series of closings beginning in january and extending through march  in the first quarter of fiscal year  transaction costs of million related to the sale and transfer of equipment and lease obligations were expensed 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment in the flash ventures for conversion to new process technologies or the addition of wafer capacity 
flash partners has reached full wafer capacity 
flash alliance s production output ramped in fiscal year to more than of its estimated full wafer capacity 
during fiscal year  we expect our portion of capital investments in flash ventures for new process technologies and additional wafer capacity to be between million to million  which we expect will be funded through additional loans to flash ventures  working capital contributions from flash ventures and equipment operating leases 

table of contents flashvision venture with toshiba 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we and toshiba determined that production of nand flash memory products utilizing millimeter wafers was no longer cost effective relative to market prices for nand flash memory and decided to wind down the flashvision venture 
as part of the ongoing wind down of flashvision  toshiba purchased certain assets of flashvision 
the existing master equipment lease agreement between flashvision and a consortium of financial institutions has been retired  thereby releasing us from our contingent indemnification obligation with toshiba 
in fiscal year  we received distributions of million  released million of cumulative translation adjustments recorded in accumulated oci and impaired the remaining million relating to our investment in flashvision 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at january   and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers 
in addition  we also have significant costs denominated in the chinese renminbi and the israeli new shekel  and we have revenue denominated in the european euro and the british pound 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future japanese yen costs for nand flash wafers 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income expense or as a component of accumulated oci and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized 
these foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve  and they could harm our financial results and cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investment grade marketable securities 
as of january   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar  with some revenues transacted in the european euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen 
our flash memory costs  which represent the largest portion of our cost of revenues  are denominated in the japanese yen 
we also have some cost of revenues denominated in chinese renminbi 
the majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the us dollar  however  we have expenses denominated in the israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies 
on the balance sheet  we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  with the largest monetary exposure being our notes receivable from flash ventures  which are denominated in japanese yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the fair value of these contracts is reflected as other current assets or other current liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially hedge our future japanese yen flash memory costs 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated oci and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized 
at january   we had foreign currency forward exchange and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in us dollar equivalent of approximately million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position 
the maturities of these contracts were months or less 
at january  we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts in place to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in japanese yen due to the low exchange rate of the us dollar against the japanese yen relative to historical levels 

table of contents the notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated balance sheet hedges as of january  is shown in the table below 
in addition  this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
these changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
notional amount unrealized gain loss as of january  change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in thousands balance sheet hedges cross currency swap contracts entered forward contracts sold forward contracts purchased total net outstanding contracts notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks  we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures  and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we do hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of january   a reduction in price of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially
