item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report and any other cautionary statements contained herein 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  levels of market interest rates  and by competition  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results of operations particularly dependent on the alaska economy 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting a target range and minimum for the net interest margin and running simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
in order to control interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to shorten the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize the pricing of new loans on a floating rate basis in order to achieve a more asset sensitive position  thereby allowing quicker repricings and maximizing net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  our philosophy is to lengthen the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize fixed rate loans  thereby becoming more liability sensitive 
in each case  the goal is to exceed our targeted net interest income range without exceeding earnings risk parameters 
our excess liquidity not needed for current operations has generally been invested in short term assets or securities  primarily securities issued by government sponsored entities 
the securities portfolio contributes to our profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
the primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is determination of mix  maturity  and repricing characteristics of the loan portfolios 
the loan and securities portfolios must be used in combination with management of deposits and borrowing liabilities and other asset liability techniques to actively manage the applicable components of the balance sheet 
in doing so  we estimate our future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases  and estimated interest rate changes 
although analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk  we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance it should not be used as the primary indicator of exposure to interest rate risk and the related volatility of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate gap analysis is primarily a measure of liquidity based upon the amount of change in principal amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding  as opposed to a measure of changes in the overall net interest margin 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data based upon regulatory reporting formats and  therefore  may not be wholly consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in the audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits  and competition

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in their interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the lives of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables as can the relationship of rates between different loan and deposit categories 
moreover  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 

table of contents we utilize a simulation model to monitor and manage interest rate risk within parameters established by our internal policy 
the model projects the impact of a basis point increase and a basis point decrease  from prevailing interest rates  on the balance sheet over a period of months 
generalized assumptions are made on how investment securities  classes of loans and various deposit products might respond to the interest rate changes 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income nor precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results would differ from simulated results due to factors such as timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes  customer reaction to rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the simulation models at december   we expect an increase in net interest income of  and an increase of  in net interest income over a month period  if interest rates decreased or increased an immediate basis points  respectively 
as indicated in the table above  at december   the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature faster than the company s earning assets by a margin of million over the next months 
the results of the simulation model indicate an increase in net interest income in a falling rate environment and a slight increase in net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the similar results between the basis point increase and decrease are due to current loan pricing with floors on interest rates that limit the negative effect of a decrease in interest rates
