overview and executive summary agilent is the world s premier measurement company  providing core electronic and bio analytical measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
in the first quarter of  we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses 
the bio analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis 
the electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test  which were reported separately in following this re organization  agilent has three businesses life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement 
all historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements 
on may   we completed the previously announced acquisition of varian inc varian under the merger agreement  dated july  the results of varian are included in agilent s consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 
as part of the european commission s merger approval and the federal trade commission consent order  agilent committed to sell varian s laboratory gas chromatography gc business  varian s triple quadrupole gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms business  varian s inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms business  and agilent s micro gc business 
on may  we completed the sale of the varian laboratory gc business  the triple quadrupole gc ms business  the icp ms business and the agilent micro gc business 
on may   we completed the sale of the network solutions division nsd of our electronic measurement business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu  a leading communications test and measurement company 
nsd includes agilent s network assurance solutions  network protocol test and drive test products 

table of contents on february   the company sold hycor biomedical inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  to linden llc  a chicago based healthcare private equity firm 
hycor is a global manufacturer and marketer of in vitro diagnostics products 
agilent s total orders in were  million  an increase of percent when compared to the increase in orders associated with the varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for percentage points of order growth for the year ended october  when compared to agilent s total orders in decreased percent when compared to as the global economy remained depressed 
agilent s net revenue of  million increased percent when compared to the revenue increase associated with the varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses the network solutions and hycor businesses accounted for percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended october  when compared to excluding the varian acquisition and hycor divestiture  sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended october  when compared to the prior year 
excluding the varian acquisition  sales to all end markets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended october  when compared to within electronic measurement  general purpose end markets improved strongly in when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses 
also within electronic measurement  the communications test businesses improved in the year ended october  when compared to the prior year with wireless r d and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year 
agilent s total net revenue in decreased percent when compared to with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn 
net income was million in  a net loss of million in and net income of million in in  and we generated operating cash flows of million  million and million  respectively 
as of october  and we had cash and cash equivalents balances  million and  million  respectively 
our restructuring program  the fy plan  announced in the first half of  was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle 
workforce reduction payments  primarily severance  were largely complete in fiscal year lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal  and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year as of october   a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the fy plan 
on may   we completed our acquisition of varian  inc varian  a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and chemical analysis market applications  by means of a merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with and into varian such that varian became a wholly owned subsidiary of agilent 
the billion total purchase price of varian included cash per share of varian s outstanding common stock including vested and non vested in the money stock options at cash per share less their exercise price 
varian s non vested restricted stock awards  non vested performance shares  at percent of target  and non vested director s stock units were also paid at per share 
as part of the european commission s merger approval and the federal trade commission consent order  agilent committed to sell varian s laboratory gas chromatography gc business  varian s triple quadrupole gas 
table of contents chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms business  varian s inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms business  and agilent s micro gc business 
on may  we completed the sale of the varian laboratory gc business  the triple quadrupole gc ms business  the icp ms business and the agilent micro gc business for approximately million 
we financed the purchase price of varian using the proceeds from our september offering of senior notes and other existing cash 
the varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of varian are included in agilent s consolidated financial statements from the date of merger 
we expect to realize operational and cost synergies  leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources  and utilize the assembled workforce 
the company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs 
the company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities 
for additional details related to the acquisition of varian  see note  acquisition of varian 
looking forward  while the economy remains uncertain  we continue to see numerous market opportunities and we believe agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them 
we are focused on integrating varian into agilent throughout fiscal and our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies  as well as drive technology sharing between our businesses 
we now believe that we will achieve million in net savings as a result of the integration of varian into agilent 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  investment impairments  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether 
table of contents fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
investment impairments 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under the authoritative guidance  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted  which we believe is representative of future behavior 
in we used implied volatility of agilent s publicly traded  similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards 
from  we have moved to historical volatility of agilent s stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
in reaching this conclusion  we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing 
a percent increase in our estimated volatility from percent to percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately percent if no other factors were changed 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from years to years 
in revising this estimate  we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees 
in the first quarter of  we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees  on average  exercise their options at years 
there was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in see note  share based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management 
table of contents judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for both us and us plans 
for  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio 
for  the us discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair value 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for would result in a million impact on us pension expense and a million impact on non us pension expense 
the net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in  million in  and million in goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as defined in the authoritative guidance  a reporting unit is an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment 
we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 
we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement 
we test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment  as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization  taking into account an appropriate control premium 
we then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair 
table of contents value calculations based on the income approach 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
the circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include  but are not limited to  the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step of the goodwill impairment test significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  a portion of a reporting unit s goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value 
the results of our test for goodwill impairment  as of september   showed that the estimated fair values of our life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
a percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately percent 
there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended october  we continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step of the goodwill impairment test 
purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies  proprietary know how  trademarks  and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from months to years 
in process research and development ipr d is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter 
when the ipr d project is complete  it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
if an ipr d project is abandoned  agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to agilent s consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in and recorded million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities  asset impairments and special charges related to inventory 
workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises 
these estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 

table of contents asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell 
the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand 
if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
at october   we provided a partial valuation allowance for our us deferred tax assets and either a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in the respective taxing jurisdiction 
we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model  the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result

foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge revenues  expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short term basis rolling twelve month period 
therefore  we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term

gross inventory charges were million in  million in and million in sales of previously written down inventory were million in  million in and million in our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future  foundation technologies  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences  which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes  and measurement  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices  digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies  software  systems and solutions such as applied mathematics  knowledge management and measurement science  life sciences such as computational biology  molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements  and photonics  such as precision automation technology  optical switching and high speed optical links 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  focus on major new product releases  and develop new product segments for the future 
due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses  there are a number of drivers of this expense 
for the year ended october  we recorded a million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and million of income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with hewlett packard company 
at october   our headcount was approximately  compared to  in and  in the increase in our headcount in  compared to  was due to the varian acquisition 
the decrease in our headcount in  compared to  was due to our restructuring program 

table of contents provision for income taxes years ended october  in millions provision for income taxes for  the annual effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate includes a million beneficial release of the uk valuation allowance  a million current year increase in prior year tax reserves  and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
also included is a million tax benefit related to a million non taxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard company 
without considering interest and penalties  the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results 
the tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
in addition  net tax benefits totaling million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate 
without considering interest and penalties  the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent 
the percent effective tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the us federal and state valuation allowances which results in us tax expense of nearly zero 
it also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
without considering interest and penalties  the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the netherlands  puerto rico  switzerland  the us  and the us where we have recorded valuation allowances 
agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions  most significantly in singapore and malaysia 
the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions 
as a result of the incentives  the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
during  we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
during  we maintained a partial us federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our us state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
during and  we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for us federal and state deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
in  after 
table of contents consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence  we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the uk deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire valuation allowance 
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  for all us and other tax jurisdictions  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
on august  we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs for tax years through the adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our statement of operations 
our us federal income tax returns for through are under audit by the irs 
in december  we reached an agreement with the irs for tax years in addition  agilent and the irs reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
global infrastructure organization agilent s global infrastructure organization gio remains a key component of our operating model 
gio  which includes it  workplace services  human resources  legal  finance and other corporate functions  has reduced its cost structure over the past year in conjunction with the business restructuring that was completed 
we will continue to efficiently manage and leverage our infrastructure resources to support our businesses in the coming year 
segment overview agilent is a measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences  chemical analysis  communications and electronics industries 
agilent has three primary businesses focused on the life sciences market  the chemical analysis market and the electronic measurement market 
in the first quarter of  we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses 
the bio analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis 
the electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test  which were reported separately in following this re organization  agilent has three businesses life sciences  chemical analysis and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment 
the three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance 
other factors  including technology and delivery channels  consumer specific solutions and specialized manufacturing  are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments 
all historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements 

table of contents life sciences our life sciences business provides application focused solutions that include instruments  software  consumables  and services that enable customers to identify  quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products

the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable libor based interest rate 
the hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness  and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes

off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

table of contents the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october  for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared to same amount as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
retirement plans 
commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and non us defined benefit plans and to our post retirement medical plans 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments 
we have issued long term debt in us dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing 
we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change  and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 
the interest rate swaps effectively change our fixed interest rate payments to us dollar libor based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments 
by entering into these interest rate swaps we are also hedging the movements in the fair value of the fixed rate debt on our balance sheet 
however  not all of our fixed rate debt s fair value is hedged in this manner  and in the future we may choose to terminate previously executed swaps 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt 
as of october   the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt
