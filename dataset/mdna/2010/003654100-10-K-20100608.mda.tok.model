item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margin and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements  including words such as may  anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of medical devices in circulatory support and we offer a continuum of care in heart recovery to acute heart failure patients 
our products are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab  by interventional cardiologists and or in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophelactically during high risk angioplasty procedures or who are in pre shock  shock or profound cardiogenic shock 
we believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome by restoring the quality of life for patients 
in addition  we believe heart recovery is the most cost effective path for the healthcare system 
our strategic focus and the driver of the most recent revenue growth in our business is the market penetration of our impella product  which received k clearance in june in addition to the k clearance  we are also conducting clinical trials of our impella for additional indications of use  with the goal of establishing impella as the standard of care in the cath lab 
we have found that the k clearance of our impella has significantly slowed our progress in completing the clinical trials  since our customers are now able to use the impella commercially outside of the clinical trials 
we received k clearance in april for our impella and impella ld devices  which are larger and provide more blood flow than the impella we are also currently in clinical trials with our impella and ld devices 
similar to our experience with the impella  we expect that the k clearance of the impella and ld will slow down our efforts to complete clinical trials with these devices 
in order for our manufacturing to meet the expected demand for our impella product  we have been implementing process improvements at our manufacturing facilities in aachen  germany  to increase the output that we can produce at the facility 
in addition to further process improvement programs designed to further increase yield and capacity levels  we plan to incrementally expand manufacturing capacity in aachen and relocate selected impella sub assembly production to our manufacturing facility in danvers  massachusetts 
as of march   we have million in fixed assets located at our athlone facility 
we have started exploring opportunities to sub lease the facility or terminate the lease early 
we expect to record an expense of approximately million as an estimate of the cost to terminate the athlone lease when we fully vacate the facility  which is expected to occur in fiscal we expect to start a second production line for impella in aachen during fiscal and are developing additional impella manufacturing capacity in danvers 
revenues from our other heart recovery products  largely focused on the heart surgery suite  decreased in fiscal as we continued to strategically focus our sales and marketing efforts towards our impella products in the cath lab 
we expect that sales from these other products  especially our non impella products  will decline in the short term as we dedicate the majority of our focus and resources on our impella products 
we have from time to time engaged in console placement programs related to our ipulse consoles  in order to encourage utilization of our bvs and ab disposables 
we have also developed a portable driver for our ab product which received fda approval under a pma supplement in march this clearance allows for immediate commercial shipment of the device to us hospitals for in hospital and transport use 
the out of hospital use is being studied in a clinical trial to allow patients to go home while waiting for recovery 
we believe that the added mobility afforded by the portable driver will help our overall ab revenues 
our bvs product was launched in and revenue from this product has been declining as ab  our next generation product for heart recovery  is designed to provide a longer duration of support than the bvs and facilitates patient mobility in the hospital 
we expect revenue from bvs to continue to decline as our customers transition more to ab disposables and our new impella and ld products geared for the surgery suite 
we expect our revenues from our non impella business during fiscal will continue to decrease as we continue to focus on our impella products 
we do not expect that revenues from sales of our replacement heart product  the abiocor  will be a material portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future as our primary strategic focus is centered around heart recovery for acute heart failure patients 
we did not recognize any abiocor revenue during fiscal or we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional net losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development expenses related to our products  conduct clinical studies on our products  and expand our commercial infrastructure in the us our financial condition was bolstered by our public offering in august  which yielded us approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering expenses 
we expect that our existing cash resources  together with our revenues  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  financial instruments  accrued expenses  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to new customers is deferred until all elements of the sale have been delivered 
all costs related to product shipment are recognized at time of shipment 
customers do not have a right of return on our product sales 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
in limited instances  we rent console medical devices on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time to customers for which revenue is recognized as earned 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  delays in regulatory approval  other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that no writedown for impairment of goodwill was required as the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
we estimate the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
the net book value of intangible assets at march  was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
although such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
although we have established extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  we record a warranty obligation related to anticipated product failure rates and product recalls 
our consoles are covered by a one year limited manufacturer s warranty 
we estimate and record a warranty obligation in cost of revenue at the time of shipment and we record any additional amounts when we determine that such costs are probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
historically  our warranty provision has not been substantial  however  our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of any product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories we value our inventories of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected demand  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
we recorded write downs of inventory in the amount of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as fees of attorneys and accountants  fees of investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and product candidates  and bonuses and commissions to our employees 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
the calculation of the fair value of the options is net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we estimated the average expected life based on historical experience of our option exercises 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historic forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at march   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in varying years from fiscal through fiscal additionally  at march   we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in varying years from fiscal through fiscal in may  we acquired impella  a german based company 
included in our nols is the utilization of certain pre acquisition nols of impella in future periods that is subject to certain statutory approvals and business requirements 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange traded instruments and listed equities 
level includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level is comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
financial assets are considered level when their fair values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
financial instruments we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with world heart corporation  or worldheart  in december  a developer of implantable mechanical circulatory support systems for chronic heart failure patients 
under the agreement  we loaned million to worldheart  with the note and accrued interest  at per annum  convertible at our option into common stock of worldheart 
we advanced million of the loan in december with the remaining million advanced in january the conversion feature within the note was an embedded derivative instrument  and accordingly  was separately valued within the carrying value of the note receivable 
we also received a warrant to purchase up to  shares of worldheart common stock 
we initially recorded the derivative financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments were recorded as change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant in the consolidated statements of operations 
the measurement of fair value was based on valuation methodologies considered appropriate by our management 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative and warrant was determined using the black scholes method 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuations of derivative instruments  estimated fair values may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed and these differences could have a material impact in the consolidated statements of operations 
in may  worldheart filed a form k disclosing that it had limited cash available to continue operations and that if it was unable to secure additional funding  it would be forced to take extraordinary business measures which could include filing for bankruptcy  ceasing operations and liquidating assets 
due to these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal relating to our note receivable to worldheart and our associated derivative instruments the embedded conversion feature and warrant 
in july  worldheart completed the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement dated june   as amended on july   we entered into with worldheart and the other parties named therein 
as a result of the transaction  we received million common shares of worldheart  which represented approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding common shares following the transaction 
the shares were received as a result of our conversion of the full amount of principal and interest owed on the million convertible note issued in december  our release of the security interest in all of the assets of worldheart that secured the note  termination of the warrant we held to purchase million common shares of worldheart  forgiveness of other amounts owed to us by worldheart  the amendment of our rights with respect to the distribution of worldheart products  and the appointment of a director or observer to worldheart s board of directors 
in october   worldheart completed a to reverse stock split  as a result of which we held  common shares of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart for net proceeds of million  which was  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  recorded as a gain on the sale of worldheart common stock during the three months ended december  in february and march  we sold  shares of worldheart for net proceeds of million which was recorded as a gain on the sale of worldheart common stock 
as of march   we held  common shares of worldheart  or approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding shares 
the carrying value of this investment was zero at march  recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon our estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us means no later than april  early adoption is permitted  however  adoption of this guidance as of a date other than april   will require us to apply this guidance retrospectively effective as of april  and will require us to disclose the effect of this guidance as applied to all previously reported interim periods in the fiscal year of adoption 
the potential impact of this standard is being evaluated 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues which includes revenues from products and funded research and development year ended march  revenues product funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative arbitration decision amortization of intangible assets total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense investment income expense  net gain on sale of worldheart stock change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant other expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella other total product revenues funded research and development total revenues product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue due to greater demand in the us of the impella  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue  primarily related to bvs and ab impella revenues for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella  primarily as a result of sales occurring after our k clearance in june  as we focus on increasing utilization of impella through continued sales force and physician training 
we have also generated sales of impella and impella ld in the us in fiscal following k clearance received in april we have sold the impella to over hospitals in the us and our focus for fiscal will be concentrated on working with these hospitals to assist them in using impella on a regular basis  thus creating continued demand for the product 
other revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decrease in bvs and ab disposable revenue as well as a decrease in console revenue supporting these product lines 
we expect that bvs and ab revenue will continue to decline in fiscal as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on impella and ld 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to shipments of higher volumes of impella disposable products in fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella disposables and lower amount of impella and ipulse console placements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to higher clinical trial activity related to impella program spending on product enhancements to impella during fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
the increase in product development costs reflects our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines  particularly impella  across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care 
we expect research and development spending to increase slightly in fiscal in order to support our efforts in enrolling patients in our clinical studies for impella we also will incur expenses to support improvements to our impella product line and continue to invest in research on new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to investments in marketing initiatives and commercial infrastructure to support the launch and expansion of the impella platform 
we expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities in fiscal  with particular investments in clinical personnel with cath lab expertise and we also plan to increase our marketing  service and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and field clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
investment expense and income  net investment income  net  was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million from investment expense of million for fiscal the increase in investment income for fiscal was due to improvements in the fair value of our columbia fund investment that allowed us to recover a portion of the unrealized losses previously incurred on our investment in the columbia fund 
gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we entered into an agreement in which we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  resulted in a gain of million that was recorded during fiscal in february and march  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million that was recorded during fiscal other expense the changes in other expense are due to foreign exchange effects on transactions 
provision for income taxes during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
the decrease in income tax expense in fiscal is due to a refundable research and development tax credit we received in january net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of our focus on increasing impella utilization in the us and a million gain from the sale of worldheart stock in fiscal we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to invest in expanding our global distribution to support revenue growth and as we invest in research and development and our impella clinical studies to bring impella and other new products to market 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella other total product revenues funded research and development total revenues product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue of due to greater demand in the us following k clearance of the impella in june  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue 
impella revenues for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue for fiscal was from disposable product sales of impella  primarily as a result of sales occurring after our k clearance in june our launch strategy of impella has been focused on increasing demand for disposable products by providing consoles to initial sites at no cost 
other revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decrease in bvs and ab disposable revenue as well as a decrease in console revenue supporting these product lines 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to shipments of higher volumes of impella disposable products in fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the effect of certain impella  ab  ipulse  and portable driver console programs implemented to generate future disposable revenue 
cost of product revenues also was negatively impacted during fiscal from materials  training and other expenses related to our capacity ramp up of impella 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to higher clinical trial activity for impella  offset by lower program spending on portable driver and abiocor 
research and development expenses for fiscal and included and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
the increase in product development costs reflects our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase is partially due to an increase of million in stock based compensation primarily associated with grants of restricted stock made in may and august  partially offset by reduced rental expense for our danvers facility 
we have also made investments in marketing initiatives and in sales and clinical representatives with commercial headcount in the us amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
investment expense and income  net investment expense  net  was million for fiscal  representing a decrease of million from investment income of million for fiscal the decrease in investment income for the fiscal was due to realized and unrealized losses incurred on our investment in the columbia fund and a decrease in interest rates on short term marketable securities 
investment income and expense  net  consisted primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments and changes in the value of the columbia fund 
other income expense in december  we entered into an agreement in which we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  resulted in a gain of million that was recorded during fiscal the changes in other expense are mainly due to foreign exchange effects 
provision for income taxes during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the increase in income tax expense fiscal was due to higher deferred tax expense associated with the increase in goodwill due to the milestone paid to the former shareholders of impella upon fda k clearance of impella in june net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of k clearance of the impella in the us in june we also incurred in fiscal a million charge relating to the change in value of the worldheart note receivable and warrant and a million charge relating to the arbitration award and warrant repurchase 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities totaled million  a decrease of million compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at march  in august  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
marketable securities at march  include million held in funds that invest solely in us treasury securities 
prior to december   we also held investments in the columbia fund 
in december  the columbia fund ceased accepting redemption requests from new or current investors 
our investments in the columbia fund were frozen since december  and we were subject to redemptions of the investments based on the discretion of the fund 
in december  we received the final redemption from the fund  and we have no investments remaining in the columbia fund at march  since december  we incurred million in realized losses on the columbia fund through the final redemption 
we are not a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we continue to monitor our cash position closely with recent economic events and only invest excess cash in short term us treasury securities 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the overall health of the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund the expansion of our commercial infrastructure in the us  increase our impella manufacturing capacity  fund new product development  and general working capital needs 
through march   we have funded our operations principally from product sales and through the sale of equity securities  including our august stock offering in which we received proceeds of million 
we also generate funds from government funded research and development revenue 
our operating activities during the year ended march  used cash of million as compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
our net loss for the year ended march  of million was the primary cause of our cash use from operations 
accounts payable used cash of million during fiscal due to increased expenditures 
these decreases in cash were partially offset by adjustments of million related to stock based compensation expense  million of depreciation and amortization  and million in write downs of inventory for excess and obsolescence during fiscal in addition  we received proceeds of million for the sale of worldheart stock that reduced our net loss for fiscal we expect to use less cash from operations in fiscal as our revenues continue to grow 
our investing activities during the year ended march  provided cash of million as compared to a use of cash of million during the same period in the prior year 
cash provided by investment activities for the year ended march  consisted primarily of million of net sales of short term marketable securities 
we also received million in proceeds from the sale of worldheart stock in fiscal this was offset by million related to cash expenditures for property and equipment primarily on computer software projects and manufacturing equipment 
additionally  we paid million in may of the final milestone payment related to our acquisition of impella in cash and elected to pay the remaining amount through the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock 
our financing activities during the year ended march  provided cash of million as compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal were attributable to the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was primarily comprised of million in net proceeds related to our august public offering and million attributable to the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be to million  which relate primarily to our planned manufacturing capacity increases for impella and software development projects 
our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers ability to pay for our products 
factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients after our products are sold 
exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products  we believe that current available funds and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  working capital  and other cash requirements at least through the next months 
we continue to review our long term cash needs on a regular basis 
currently  we have no debt outstanding 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year in s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments contractual obligations total obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and expected liabilities under agreements with third parties  primarily for research and development activities  such as clinical trials 
we have no long term debt  capital leases or other material commitments for open purchase orders and clinical trial agreements at march  other than those shown in the table above 
in may  we acquired all the shares of outstanding capital stock of impella cardiosystems ag  a company headquartered in aachen  germany 
the aggregate purchase price excluding contingent payments  was approximately million  which consisted of million of our common stock  million of cash paid to certain former shareholders of impella and million of transaction costs  consisting primarily of fees paid for financial advisory and legal services 
at the time of the transaction  we agreed to make additional contingent payments to impella s former shareholders based on additional milestone payments related to product sales and fda approvals in the amount of up to million 
in january upon the sale of  impella units  we paid million in the form of common stock 
in june we received k clearance of our impella  and we paid million in the form of common stock 
in april  we received k clearance of our impella  triggering an obligation to make the final million milestone payment 
in may  we paid million of this final milestone in cash and elected to pay the remaining amount through the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock

these disclosure provisions require that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk primary market risk exposures our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
marketable securities at march  consist of million in five funds that invest in us treasury securities and related interest 
currency exchange rates our foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the euro 
therefore  our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
had a depreciation in the euro occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
