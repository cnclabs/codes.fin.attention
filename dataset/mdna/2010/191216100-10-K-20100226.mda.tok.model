our business general the coca cola company is the world s leading owner and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage brands and the world s largest manufacturer  distributor and marketer of concentrates and syrups used to produce nonalcoholic beverages 
we own or license and market more than nonalcoholic beverage brands  primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters  enhanced waters  juices and juice drinks  ready to drink teas and coffees  and energy and sports drinks 
along with coca cola  which is recognized as the world s most valuable brand  we own and market four of the world s top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands  including diet coke  fanta and sprite 
through the world s largest beverage distribution system  consumers in more than countries enjoy the company s beverages at a rate of approximately billion servings each day 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows by selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as finished beverages 
we generally sell these products to bottling and canning operations  fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers  and  in the case of finished products  to distributors 
our bottlers sell our branded products to businesses and institutions including retail chains  supermarkets  restaurants  small neighborhood grocers  sports and entertainment venues  and schools and colleges 
we continue to expand our marketing presence and increase our unit case volume in developed  developing and emerging markets 
our strong and stable system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing  distributing and marketing existing  enhanced and new innovative products to our consumers throughout the world 
we have three types of bottling relationships bottlers in which our company has no ownership interest  bottlers in which our company has a noncontrolling ownership interest and bottlers in which our company has a controlling ownership interest 
we authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates and syrups into branded finished products that they then distribute and sell 
while we primarily manufacture  market and sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners  from time to time we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation  often on a temporary basis 
often  though not always  these acquired bottling operations are in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance 
owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler s sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures 
acquisitions or consolidation of bottling operations during and resulted in a substantial increase in the number of bottling plants included in our consolidated financial statements and in the number of our associates 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  net operating revenues generated by company owned or consolidated bottling operations which are included in the bottling investments operating segment represented approximately percent of our company s consolidated net operating revenues and distributed approximately percent of our worldwide unit case volume 
in  bottling partners in which our company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest produced and distributed approximately percent of our worldwide unit case volume 
the remaining approximately percent of our worldwide unit case volume in was produced by our fountain operations and our juice and juice drink  sports drink and other finished beverage operations 
we make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands  including expenditures for advertising  sponsorship fees and special promotional events 
as part of our marketing activities  we  at our discretion  provide retailers and distributors with promotions and point of sale displays  our bottling partners with advertising support and funds designated for the purchase of cold drink equipment  and our consumers with coupons  discounts and promotional incentives 
these marketing expenditures help to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands 
we believe that greater awareness and preference promote long term growth in unit case volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry we operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry 
we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies 
we  along with other beverage companies  are affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  cost to manufacture and distribute products  consumer spending  economic conditions  availability and quality of water  consumer preferences  inflation  political climate  local and national laws and regulations  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fuel prices and weather patterns 
our objective our objective is to use our formidable assets brands  financial strength  unrivaled distribution system  global reach  and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide to achieve long term sustainable growth 
our vision for sustainable growth includes the following people being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be 
portfolio bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people s desires and needs 
partners nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty 
planet being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference 
profit maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities 
productivity managing our people  time and money for greatest effectiveness 
strategic priorities we have four strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our company and the coca cola system and value for our shareowners 
these strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership  accelerating innovation  leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio  and leading the coca cola system for growth 
to enable the entire coca cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities  we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing  commercial leadership  and franchise leadership 
core capabilities consumer marketing marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands 
this produces long term growth in unit case volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace  we create and implement integrated marketing programs  both globally and locally  that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands 
in developing a strategy for a company brand  we conduct product and packaging research  establish brand positioning  develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback 
our integrated marketing activities include  but are not limited to  advertising  point of sale merchandising and sales promotions 
we have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets  increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets 
in emerging markets  we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers 
in developing markets  where consumer access has largely been established  our focus is on differentiating our brands 
in our most developed markets  we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs  but at a slower rate than revenue growth 
we are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment 
commercial leadership the coca cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers 
we focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses 
our approach includes understanding each customer s business and needs  whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market 
we focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the company 
we are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences  product availability and delivery systems  and beverage merchandising and displays 
we participate in joint brand building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands 
through our commercial leadership initiatives  we embed ourselves further into our retail customers businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale 
franchise leadership we must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values  aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers always changing needs and tastes 
the financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the company s success 
we work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies  and we share best practices throughout the bottling system 
our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins 
with our bottling partners  we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers 
we also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners 
we will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the coca cola system to gain a competitive advantage 
challenges and risks being a global company provides unique opportunities for our company 
challenges and risks accompany those opportunities 
our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our company 
of these  four key challenges and risks are discussed below 
obesity and inactive lifestyles 
increasing concern among consumers  public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry 
we recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem 
our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line  which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks and water products 
our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace  supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education  and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation  choice and variety 
we are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments  educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs 
water quality and quantity 
water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our company s attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry  governments  nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate 
water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products 
it is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation  increasing pollution and poor management 
our company is in an excellent position to share the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve water resource management  water treatment  wastewater treatment systems  and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs 
we are actively engaged in assessing the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program 
we are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects 
we are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world  we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource 
evolving consumer preferences 
consumers want more choices 
we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs  on the go lifestyles  aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever 
we are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products 
we are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs  desires and lifestyle choices 
increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace 
our company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local participants 
we must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share 
all four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles  water quality and quantity  evolving consumer preferences  and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our company  however  we believe our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks

risk factors in part i of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following basis of presentation principles of consolidation recoverability of noncurrent assets revenue recognition income taxes contingencies management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions 
furthermore  when testing assets for impairment in future periods  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur  impairment charges may result 
we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our company s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies 
the carrying values of our equity method investments are increased or decreased by our proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income loss oci of these companies 
the carrying values of our equity method investments are also decreased by dividends we receive from the investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions 
we eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions  including the intercompany transactions with consolidated vies and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states provide entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the change in fair value being included in the determination of net income 
the company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option  and therefore  we only measure assets and liabilities at fair value if required under other accounting guidance 
certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation 
principles of consolidation our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as vies of which our company is the primary beneficiary 
generally  we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest 
however  there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition ownership of a majority voting interest of consolidation does not apply 
these situations generally occur when one entity has a controlling financial interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests  which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity s voting interests in  and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of  the other business enterprise 
this disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest  and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a vie 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as of december   the best evidence of control of a vie is not necessarily voting interests 
the entity that holds a majority of the variable interests in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore to control the entity 
upon consolidation  the primary beneficiary is generally required to include assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on a majority voting interest 
our company holds interests in certain entities  primarily bottling operations  that are considered vies 
these variable interests relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support for these entities 
our company s investments  plus any loans and guarantees  related to these vies totaled approximately million and million at december   and  respectively  representing our maximum exposures to loss 
creditors of the vies do not have recourse against the general credit of the company as a result of including these vies in our consolidated financial statements 
the company s investment  plus any loans and guarantees  related to vies was not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  assets and liabilities of vies for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we do not have any significant variable interests in entities for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on accounting for vies 
the new accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective january  among other things  the new guidance requires more qualitative than quantitative analyses to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  enhances disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie  and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie 
under the new guidance  a vie must be consolidated if the enterprise has both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
beginning january   we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of this change in accounting policy 
these entities are primarily bottling operations and had previously been consolidated due to certain loan guarantees and or other financial support given by the company 
these financial arrangements  although not significant to our consolidated financial statements  resulted in a disproportionate relationship between our voting interests in these entities and our exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of the entities 
as a result  we determined that we held a majority of the variable interests in these entities and  therefore  were deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the loan guarantees and or other financial support given by the company to these entities are included in the calculation of our maximum exposure to loss discussed above 
although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding a majority of the variable interests in these vies  the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the vies economic performance 
consequently  subsequent to the change in accounting policy  the company deconsolidated the majority of these vies 
the entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for less than percent of net income attributable to shareowners of the coca cola company in  and we have accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting since january  although the deconsolidation of these entities will impact individual line items in our consolidated financial statements  the impact on net income attributable to shareowners of the coca cola company in future periods will be nominal 
the equity method of accounting is intended to be a single line consolidation and  therefore  generally should result in the same net income attributable to the investor as would be the case if the investee had been consolidated 
the main impact on our consolidated financial statements beginning in will be that instead of these entities results of operations and balance sheets affecting our consolidated line items  our proportionate share of net income or loss from these entities will be reported in equity income loss net  in our consolidated income statements  and our investment in these entities will be reported as equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to the heading operations review for the estimated impact that the deconsolidation of these entities will have on individual line items in our consolidated income statements in future periods 
recoverability of noncurrent assets we perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for certain assets  recoverability and or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other assets  impairment tests are required at least annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and or impairment tests 
if an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees  the company would record its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income loss net in our consolidated income statements 
however  the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences  deferred taxes and deferred gains 
management s assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates 
these estimates require significant management judgment  include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent  therefore  they do not change in isolation 
factors that management must estimate include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volume  prices  inflation  cost of capital  marketing spending  foreign currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
these factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile 
the estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
when performing impairment tests  we estimate the fair values of the assets using management s best assumptions  which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed  impairment charges could have resulted 
as mentioned above  these factors do not change in isolation  and therefore  we do not believe it is practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future impairment charges could result 
our company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic  political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate  particularly in developing or emerging markets 
refer to the heading our business challenges and risks  above  and item a 
risk factors in part i of this report 
as a result  management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world 
investments in equity and debt securities the carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method  the cost method or the fair value method 
refer to the heading basis of presentation  above  for information related to how the carrying values of our equity method investments are determined 
we account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method  as applicable 
investments in equity securities are carried at fair value  if the fair value of the security is readily determinable 
equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available for sale securities 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in net income 
unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred taxes  on available for sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci 
trading securities are reported as marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets 
securities classified as available for sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets  depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment 
investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method 
in accordance with the cost method  our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared 
cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value 
investments in debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity 
investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available for sale 
the following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities in millions december  carrying value percentage of total assets equity method investments securities classified as available for sale cost method investments securities classified as held to maturity securities classified as trading total accounts for less than percent of the company s total assets 
investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment  since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income 
we review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available for sale or held to maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment 
when such events or changes occur  we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment 
we also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period 
the fair values of most of our company s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices 
for investments in nonpublicly traded companies  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals  as appropriate 
we consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and emerging markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis  management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if management determines the decline is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on  among other things  the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
as of december   the company had several investments classified as available for sale securities in which our cost basis had exceeded the fair value of the investment 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  as of december   were approximately million and million  respectively 
management assessed each individual investment with unrealized losses to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary 
based on these assessments  management determined that the decline in fair value of each of these investments was temporary in nature 
we will continue to monitor these investments in future periods 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a charge of approximately million in other income loss net as a result of an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment 
as of december   the estimated fair value of this investment approximated the company s carrying value in the investment 
however  during the first quarter of  the company was informed by the investee of its intent to reorganize its capital structure in  which would result in the company s shares in the investee being canceled 
as a result  the company determined that the decline in fair value of this cost method investment was other than temporary 
this impairment charge impacted the corporate operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net  and note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had several investments classified as available for sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment  each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of management assessed each individual investment to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary 
based on these assessments  management determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  uncertainty regarding our intent to hold certain of these investments for a period of time that would be sufficient to recover our cost basis in the event of a market recovery  the fact that the fair value of each investment had continued to decline since the time that our cost basis initially exceeded its fair value  and the company s uncertainty around the near term prospects for certain of the investments 
as a result of the other than temporary decline in fair value of these investments  the company recognized impairment charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter of certain of these investments are classified as marketable securities  while others are classified as other investments in the consolidated balance sheets 
these impairment charges were recorded to other income loss net in the consolidated statement of income 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net  and note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

consolidated embotelladoras coca cola polar sa the carrying value of our investment in cce was reduced to zero as of december   primarily as a result of recording our proportionate share of impairment charges and items impacting aoci recorded by cce 
the subsequent increase in the carrying value of our investment in cce was due to our proportionate share of cce s net income and items impacting aoci 
other assets our company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume 
additionally  our company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited 
advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights 
payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the carrying value of these assets was approximately  million  or percent of our total assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
property  plant and equipment as of december   the carrying value of our property  plant and equipment  net of depreciation  was approximately  million  or percent of our total assets 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment should be assessed  including  among others  a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
when such events or changes in circumstances are present  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property  plant and equipment  including appraisals and discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
in  our company recorded a charge of approximately million in equity income loss net 
this charge was primarily related to our proportionate share of asset impairments recorded by coca cola bottlers philippines  inc  ccbpi due to excess and obsolete bottles and cases 
these charges impacted the bottling investments operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review equity income loss net  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets intangible assets are classified into one of three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
the following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet in millions december  carrying value percentage of total assets trademarks with indefinite lives goodwill bottlers franchise rights definite lived intangible assets  net other intangible assets not subject to amortization total accounts for less than percent of the company s total assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets  including discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
we test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives  including trademarks  franchise rights and goodwill  for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
our company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite lived intangible assets  including  but not limited to  discounted cash flow models  which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility  which is consistent with the way management runs our business 
our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units 
these business units are also our reporting units 
the bottling investments operating segment includes all company owned or consolidated bottling operations  regardless of geographic location 
generally  each company owned or consolidated bottling operation within our bottling investments operating segment is its own reporting unit 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination 
we had no changes to our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit 
the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment  primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition 
consequently  if operating results and or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition  it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  as discussed above  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our company s actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  our company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 
the company has acquired significant intangible assets in the past several years through asset acquisitions and business combinations  including  among others  the acquisition of brands and licenses in denmark and finland from carlsberg group beverages carlsberg  german bottling and distribution operations  energy brands inc  also known as glac au  and ccbpi 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information about recently acquired intangible assets 
as of our most recent annual impairment review  the company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets  individually or in the aggregate 
in addition  as of december   we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term 
however  if macroeconomic conditions continue to worsen  it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets  which would require us to recognize impairment charges 
management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods 
in  the company recognized a million impairment charge due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset  which was previously determined to have an indefinite life 
refer to the heading operations review other operating charges  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously mentioned  the company is required to record its proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by our equity method investees 
in  we recorded our proportionate share of approximately billion pretax billion after tax of charges recorded by cce due to impairments of its north american franchise rights in the second quarter and fourth quarter of the company s proportionate share of these charges was approximately billion 
the decline in the estimated fair value of cce s north american franchise rights during the second quarter was the result of several factors including  but not limited to  challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher margin packages and certain higher margin beverage categories  increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum  hfcs and resin  and increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs 
the decline in the estimated fair value of cce s north american franchise rights during the fourth quarter was primarily driven by financial market conditions as of the measurement date that caused a dramatic increase in market debt rates  which impacted the capital charge  and a significant decline in the funded status of cce s defined benefit pension plans 
in addition  the market price of cce s common stock declined by more than percent between the date of cce s interim impairment test may  and the date of cce s annual impairment test october  
our proportionate share of these charges was recorded to equity income loss net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the bottling investments operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review equity income loss net and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of products has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our company  this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners  resellers or other customers 
in particular  title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations  as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction 
our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part 
our customers can earn certain incentives  which are included in deductions from revenue  a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
these incentives include  but are not limited to  cash discounts  funds for promotional and marketing activities  volume based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the company in relation to these programs  including amortization expense on infrastructure programs  were approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in preparing the financial statements  management must make estimates related to the contractual terms  customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue 
management also considers past results in making such estimates 
the actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates 
such differences are recorded once they have been determined  and have historically not been significant 
income taxes in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance that clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our company adopted the provisions of this accounting guidance and changed our accounting policy effective january  as a result  we recorded an approximate million increase in accrued income taxes in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the january   balance of reinvested earnings 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position  amount  and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
additionally  undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
the company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
the company s effective tax rate is expected to be approximately percent to percent in this estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in contingencies our company is subject to various claims and contingencies  mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters both income taxes and indirect taxes 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings  tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole

operations review we manufacture  distribute and market nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups 
we also manufacture  distribute and market finished beverages 
our organizational structure as of december   consisted of the following operating segments  the first six of which are sometimes referred to as operating groups or groups eurasia and africa  europe  latin america  north america  pacific  bottling investments  and corporate 
for further information regarding our operating segments  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
beverage volume we measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways unit cases of finished products and concentrate sales 
as used in this report  unit case means a unit of measurement equal to us fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings  and unit case volume means the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners the coca cola system to customers 
unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks 
also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to  or distributed by  our company  and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit 
such products licensed to  or distributed by  our company and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of our total unit case volume 
in addition  unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest 
although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume  we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level 
the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors 
concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups  in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by  or used in finished beverages sold by  the company to its bottling partners or other customers 
most of our revenues are based on concentrate sales  a primarily wholesale activity 
unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period 
factors such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases  new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates 
in addition to the items mentioned above  the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures  in which the company has an equity interest  but to which the company does not sell concentrates or syrups  may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates

many of these strategies impact net revenues instead of marketing expenses 
refer to the heading selling  general and administrative expenses  below 
the growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets 
refer to the heading operating income and operating margin  below 
we currently expect the impact of price and product geographic mix in to be similar to the unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations decreased net operating revenues by approximately percent 
the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger us dollar compared to most foreign currencies  including the euro  south african rand  british pound  brazilian real  mexican peso and australian dollar  which had an unfavorable impact on the eurasia and africa  europe  latin america  pacific and bottling investments operating segments

the size and timing of structural changes  including acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and canning operations  do not occur consistently from period to period 
as a result  anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues and other financial statement line items usually is not possible

we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital  which increases our return on shareowners equity 
this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates 
our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings 
as of december   our long term debt was rated a by standard poor s  aa by moody s and a by fitch 
our commercial paper program was rated a by standard poor s  p by moody s and f by fitch 
in assessing our credit strength  all three agencies consider our capital structure including the amount and maturity dates of our debt and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the company and certain bottlers  including cce and coca cola hellenic 
while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company s business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable 
it is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology 
if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure  our major bottlers financial performance  changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength  or for any other reason  our cost of borrowing could increase 
additionally  if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline  the company s share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers 
in  standard poor s affirmed the company s a long term debt rating and revised its outlook from negative to stable 
moody s revised its aa rating for the company s long term debt in from negative outlook to stable 
the company does not believe that a downgrade by either agency would have a significant adverse effect on the cost of borrowing 
we monitor our financial ratios and  as indicated above  the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings 
however  the rating agencies aggregate financial data for certain bottlers along with our company when assessing our debt rating 
both standard poor s and moody s employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the various financial ratios 
these thresholds are not necessarily permanent  nor are they always fully disclosed to our company 
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world  enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost 
this posture  coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing 
our debt management policies  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets 
issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities 
on december   we had approximately  million in lines of credit and other short term credit facilities available  of which approximately million was outstanding

share repurchases on july   the board of directors of the company authorized a share repurchase program of up to million shares of the company s common stock 
the program took effect on october  the table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share year ended december  number of shares repurchased in millions average price per share since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in through our current program as of december   we have purchased approximately billion shares of our company s common stock at an average price per share of

dividends at its february meeting  our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by percent  raising it to per share  equivalent to a full year dividend of per share in this is our th consecutive annual increase 
our annual common stock dividend was per share  per share and per share in  and  respectively 
the dividend represented an percent increase from  and the dividend represented a percent increase from off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
as of december   we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately million 
these guarantees primarily are related to third party customers  bottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees was individually significant 
the amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees  however  we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees 
management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our company under these guarantees is not probable 
as of december   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
our company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows in millions payments due by period total and thereafter short term loans and notes payable commercial paper borrowings lines of credit and other short term borrowings current maturities of long term debt long term debt  net of current maturities estimated interest payments accrued income taxes purchase obligations marketing obligations lease obligations total contractual obligations  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable 
upon payment of outstanding commercial paper  we typically issue new commercial paper 
lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs  especially at international subsidiaries 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term debt 
we will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt  including the use of cash flows from operating activities  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
we calculated estimated interest payments for our long term fixed rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates 
we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding income taxes 
as of december   the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits  was approximately million  which was not included in the total above 
at this time  the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined 
in addition  any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including long term contractual obligations  open purchase orders  accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities 
we expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities 
included within total contractual obligations are approximately million of obligations of entities that were deconsolidated effective january  refer to the heading critical accounting policies and estimates principles of consolidation 
the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december   was approximately  million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  pension expense  funding levels  plan amendments  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and the investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
the pension protection act of ppa was enacted in august and established  among other things  new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans 
during  the funded status of the company s primary us defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline 
in early  the company contributed approximately million to this plan 
subsequent to this contribution  the plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the ppa 
we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
our international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
we do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in or thereafter 
therefore  no amounts have been included in the table above 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of plan assets was approximately  million 
the majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the us qualified pension plans was approximately  million  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately  million 
the majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non us employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions  as well as our unfunded us nonqualified pension plans 
these us nonqualified pension plans provide  for certain associates  benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of the expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above 
however  we anticipate annual benefit payments to these unfunded pension plans to be approximately million in and remain near that level through  decreasing annually thereafter 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred income tax liabilities as of december   were approximately  million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
foreign exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and governmental actions 
we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments  and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we use functional currencies 
due to our global operations  weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others 
in  and  the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations all operating currencies  and for certain individual currencies  strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows year ended december  all operating currencies brazilian real mexican peso australian dollar south african rand british pound euro japanese yen these percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share 
the total currency impact on operating income  including the effect of our hedging activities  was a decrease of approximately percent in and an increase of approximately percent in based on the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage in place  the company expects currencies to have a slightly positive impact on operating income in  with the benefit more heavily impacting our results in the first half of the year 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies 
the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income loss net in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net 
the company recorded a foreign currency loss of million in  a foreign currency gain of million in and a foreign currency loss of million in as of december   we translated the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary at the official exchange rate that was in effect as of that date  however  subsequent to december   the venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation  and venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy 
as a result  our local subsidiary is required to use the us dollar as its functional currency  and we will remeasure the financial statements of our local subsidiary into us dollars and recognize the related gains or losses from remeasurement in the line item other income loss net going forward 
based on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities denominated in venezuelan bolivar as of december   we anticipate recognizing an initial remeasurement loss of approximately million in the first quarter of the company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share 
overview of financial position our consolidated balance sheet as of december   compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was impacted by the following an increase in net assets of  million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts  an increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  million 
we monitor our liquidity on a net debt basis as part of our overall cash management strategy 
in  we issued commercial paper with maturities of greater than days primarily due to a favorable interest rate environment on longer term commercial paper 
in order to match the maturities of these issuances  we also began investing in longer term time deposits 
in addition  we currently expect to repurchase an additional billion of our stock during however  we anticipate that these repurchases will be subsequent to the close of our acquisition of cce s north american operations 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and an increase in long term debt of  million due to the issuance of long term debt in the first quarter of impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world 
in general  we believe that  over time  we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to months in advance  however  the majority of our derivative instruments expire within months or less 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
foreign exchange we manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
in  we generated approximately percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside the united states  therefore  weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations 
our company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options principally euro and japanese yen and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations 
interest rates we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  as well as our mix of short term debt versus long term debt 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
value at risk we monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems  including value at risk models 
our value at risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates 
we have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations 
we examined historical weekly returns over the previous years to calculate our value at risk 
the average value at risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year 
as a result of our foreign currency value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives  over a one week period  would decline by not more than approximately million  million and million  respectively  using  or average fair values  and by not more than approximately million and million  respectively  using december   and fair values 
according to our interest rate value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our average or in our december   interest rates over a one week period would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our december  and estimates were also not material to our consolidated financial statements
