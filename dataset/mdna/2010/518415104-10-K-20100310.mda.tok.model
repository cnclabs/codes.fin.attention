item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations we do not manufacture our own silicon products 
we maintain strategic relationships with large semiconductor foundries to source our finished silicon wafers 
this strategy allows us to focus our internal resources on product and market development  and eliminates the fixed cost of owning and operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
we are also able to take advantage of the ongoing advanced process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries 
the company and fujitsu limited fujitsu have entered into agreements pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 

table of contents in addition  all of our assembly operations and most of our test operations are performed by outside suppliers 
we rely on a third party vendor to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
during december  the company adopted a restructuring plan under which the company established an operations center in singapore 
the company will begin to transfer some of its supply chain activities from the company s headquarters in oregon to the new operations center in singapore in we perform certain test operations and reliability and quality assurance processes internally 
we have achieved and maintained iso quality management systems certification and iso quality systems certification  and released a full line of pld products qualified to the aec q reliability standard 
wafer fabrication we source silicon wafers from our foundry partners  fujitsu in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
in singapore  pursuant to agreements with each company and their respective affiliates 
we negotiate wafer volumes  prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
assembly after wafer fabrication and initial testing  we ship wafers to independent subcontractors for assembly 
during assembly  wafers are separated into individual die and encapsulated in plastic or ceramic packages 
presently  we have qualified assembly partners in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
we negotiate assembly prices  volumes and other terms with our assembly partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
we currently offer an extensive list of standard products in lead pb free packaging 
our lead free products meet the european parliament directive entitled restrictions on the use of hazardous substances 
we offer a relatively small list of leaded products where they are not prohibited 
we continually review our suppliers to ensure they meet or exceed our packaging requirements 
testing we electrically test the die on each wafer prior to shipment for assembly 
following assembly  prior to customer shipment  each product undergoes final testing and quality assurance procedures 
final testing on certain products is performed by independent contractors in indonesia  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  south korea  and at our oregon facility 
marketing  sales and customers we sell our products directly to end customers through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
we also employ a direct sales management and field applications engineering organization to support our end customers and indirect sales resources 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and military end markets 
as of december  we have agreements with manufacturers representatives and four primary distributors  arrow electronics  inc usa  avnet inc usa  distributors of the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong  and origin electronics a 
table of contents division of nu horizons electronics asia pte 
ltd 
singapore 
we have also established export sales channels in over foreign countries through a network of over sales representatives and distributors 
the majority of our sales are made through distributors 
orders from our sell through distributors are initially recorded at published list prices  however  the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
in addition  we allow returns from sell through distributors of unsold products under certain conditions 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by sell through distributors to an end customer 
resale of product by sell through distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
at times we protect our sell through distributors against reductions in published list prices  and expect to continue this policy in the foreseeable future 
we provide technical and marketing support to our end customers with engineering staff based at our headquarters  product development centers and selected field sales offices 
we maintain numerous domestic and international field sales offices in major metropolitan areas 
export sales as a percentage of our total revenue were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
export sales to china accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  to europe accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  to japan accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  and to taiwan accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
both export and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales to japan  where sales to certain customers are denominated in yen 
if our export sales decline significantly  there would be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
four of our largest customers are distributors and have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by arrow electronics  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  and by avnet  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of products to promaster technology corporation accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of products to asti holdings ltd 
accounted for approximately   and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  or during fiscal the company embarked on a program to restructure its distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result we expect the majority of our revenue in fiscal to be resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  lattice terminated our distribution agreement between lattice and promaster technology corporation on july   between lattice and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between lattice and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
seasonality in most years  we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products 
sales of our products are often stronger in the first half of the year and often weaker in the summer months 
in addition  december is often a weak month for sales 
however  on balance  general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry have a greater impact on our business and financial results than seasonal trends 

table of contents backlog our backlog of scheduled and released orders at january  was million  as compared to million at january  this backlog consisted of direct customer and distributor orders which includes orders to sell through distributors valued at published list prices scheduled for delivery within the next days 
the increase in backlog is primarily related to improved business conditions and the restructuring of our distribution channel  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through model 
distributor orders accounted for the majority of the backlog in both periods 
direct customer orders may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled under certain circumstances without penalty prior to shipment 
additionally  distributor orders generally may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment 
furthermore  sell through distributor orders are valued at list price and subject to price adjustments  so we do not expect to recognize revenue at the order booking price 
revenue associated with sell through distributor shipments is not recognized until the product is resold to an end customer 
sell in distributor shipments are not subject to rights of return or price adjustments 
revenue associated with sell in distributor shipments is recognized upon shipment to the distributor 
typically  a significant amount of our revenue results from orders placed and filled within the same period 
such orders are referred to as turns orders 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement made at the beginning of a period 
we do not anticipate a significant change in this business pattern 
for these reasons  backlog as of any particular date should not be used as a predictor of revenue for any future period 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid rates of technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
our current and potential competitors include a broad range of semiconductor companies from emerging companies to large  established companies  many of which have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors in the programmable logic market include silicon and software product features  price  technical support  and sales  marketing and distribution strength 
the availability of competitive intellectual property cores is also critical 
in addition to product features such as density  performance  power consumption  reprogrammability  and reliability  competition occurs on the basis of price and market acceptance of specific products and technology 
we intend to continue to address these competitive factors by working to continually introduce product enhancements and new products and by working to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
we compete directly with actel corporation  altera corporation and xilinx  inc we also indirectly compete with other semiconductor companies that provide logic solutions that are not user programmable that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  and dsp technologies 
although to date we have not experienced direct competition from companies located outside the united states  such companies may become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
competition may also increase if other larger semiconductor companies seek to expand into our market 
any such increases in competition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
intellectual property we seek to protect our products and technologies primarily through patents  trade secrecy measures  copyrights  mask work protection  trademark registrations  licensing restrictions  confidentiality agreements and other approaches designed to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop competitive technology not covered by our intellectual property rights or that measures we take to protect our technology will be effective 

table of contents patents we hold numerous domestic  european and asian patents and have patent applications pending in the united states  europe and asia 
our current patents will expire at various times between and there can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents  or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  there can be no assurance that our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
we believe that our success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  experience  creativity and the sales and marketing abilities of our personnel 
patent and other proprietary rights infringement claims are common in our industry 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to any claim made against us  that we would be able to successfully defend against the claim or that we could obtain a license that would allow us to use the proprietary rights on terms or under conditions that would not harm our business 
licenses and agreements advanced micro devices in  as part of our acquisition of vantis corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced micro devices  inc amd  we entered into an agreement with amd pursuant to which we have cross licensed vantis patents with amd patents  having an effective filing date on or before june   related to programmable logic products 
this cross license was made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we acquired certain third party license rights held by vantis prior to the acquisition 
agere systems in  as part of our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with agere and agere systems guardian corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  these agere companies assigned or licensed to us certain fpga and field programmable system chip patents  trademarks  software and other intellectual property rights and technology  and we licensed back rights in these same assets 
these cross licenses were made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
altera in  we entered into a comprehensive  royalty free  non exclusive patent cross license agreement and a multi year patent peace agreement with altera 
fujitsu we have an advance payment and purchase agreement the agreement  with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we advanced million in support of the development and construction of a mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
as of march   we had completed the unsecured advance payments 
during the third quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal  we entered into amendments amendments to the agreement  prior to which our million advance was to be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from fujitsu 
the amendments permit us to also credit the advance against the purchase price of mm wafers and other services collectively  wafer credits and other services are referred to as advance credits  including engineering mask set charges 
under the terms of a letter agreement between the company and fujitsu  fujitsu agreed to repay in cash to the company million recorded as other receivable in the consolidated balance sheet at january  
table of contents plus interest  which was received in fiscal on the outstanding portion of the advance payment made by us to fujitsu under the terms of the agreement 
in addition  we expect to receive the remaining advance of approximately million in the form of advance credits  including engineering mask set charges  by the end of the second quarter of the company s fiscal all other terms and conditions of the agreement remain in full force and effect until repayment of the advance payment in full 
the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
employees at january   we had full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
no employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
global economic conditions and uncertainty  as well as the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  could adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and expenses  collectability of accounts receivable and supplier relationships  and ability to access capital markets 
our revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the general economy or the semiconductor industry 
these downturns are often severe and prolonged and can result in significant reductions in the demand for pld and fpga products in markets in which we compete 
global economic weakness or cyclical downturns have previously resulted from periods of economic recession  reduced access to credit markets  weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies  weak end user demand  excess industry capacity or general reductions in inventory levels by customers  and may cause a decrease in revenue  gross margin  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables 
in addition  our relationships with our employees and suppliers and ability to access capital markets could be adversely affected 
in addition  customer financial difficulties have previously resulted  and could result in the future  in increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our accounts receivable 
global economic and cyclical downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
whenever adverse economic  cyclical  or end market conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
the majority of our revenue approximately of total fiscal revenue is derived from customers participating in the telecommunications equipment end market 
in addition  during fiscal the company participated in the china g telecommunications network build out by selling products used by two large telecommunication equipment providers which accounted for approximately of our aggregate revenue 
table of contents during that period 
in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
any deterioration in the communication end market or reduction in capital spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the potential impact of customer design in activity on future revenue is inherently uncertain and could impact our ability to manage production or our ability to forecast sales 
we face uncertainties relating to the potential impact of customer design in activity because it is unknown whether any particular customer design in will ultimately result in sales of significant volume 
after a specific customer design in is obtained  many factors can impact the timing and amount of sales that are ultimately realized from the specific customer design in 
changes in the competitive position of our technology  the customer s product competitiveness or product strategy  the financial position of the customer  and other factors can impact the timing and amount of sales ultimately realized from any specific customer design in 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately manage the production levels of our new products or accurately forecast the future sales of such products  and adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  and digital signal processing dsp technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established  multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
our quarterly revenue and gross margin are subject to fluctuations due to many factors which makes our future financial results less predictable 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our revenue and gross margin may fluctuate due to product mix  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographical and market segment pricing strategies  wafer  package and assembly prices and yields  overhead absorption  as well as provisions for warranty and excess and obsolete inventory 
we have limited ability to foresee changes or the pace of changes in sales by product classification 
in recent periods  we have experienced increased rates of decline in sales of our mature products 
in the past we have also experienced periods of decline in sales of our mainstream products 
if  in any period  the overall sales of the combination of our mature and mainstream products decline and if sales of new products do not increase at a rate that is sufficient to counteract this decline  then our total revenue would decline 
in addition  as mature products typically generate a higher gross margin than mainstream or new products  a faster than normal decline in sales of mature products could adversely impact our gross margins 
we also have experienced  and may experience in the future  gross margin declines in certain products  reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures  inventory write downs  charges associated with the cancellation of planned production lines  and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that  as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors  we are unable to pass on to our customers 

table of contents further  our ability to predict end customer demand and resale of our products by our sell through distributors is limited 
typically  the majority of our revenue comes from turns orders  which are orders placed and filled within the same period 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement at the beginning of a quarter 
accordingly  we cannot use backlog as a reliable measure of predicting revenue 
currently fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing and identifying manufacturing processes for the new programmable logic products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution and historically the market for fpga products has grown faster than the market for pld products 
currently we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from pld products than fpga products 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to introduce new fpga and associated software design tool products that meet evolving customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
we are presently shipping our next generation fpga product families that are critical to our ability to grow our fpga product revenue and expand our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner  or if these products or future new products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results could be harmed 
the company and fujitsu have entered into agreements pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
the success of certain of our next generation fpga products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu or new foundry partners 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in establishing new foundry relationships for our next generation products  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundry partners 
because we depend upon foundry partners to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at fabrication facilities may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
the introduction of new silicon and software design tool products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market acceptance of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
in order to secure new or additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
we are presently shipping our next generation fpga product families that are critical to our ability to grow our fpga product revenue and expand our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
our future revenue growth is 
table of contents dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  or our current products do not maintain market acceptance  our operating results may be harmed 
export sales account for the majority of our revenue and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
we derive the majority of our revenue from export sales 
accordingly  if we experience a decline in export sales  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our export sales are subject to numerous risks  including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental stimulus packages  controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  war  terrorism or pandemic disease  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivable collection periods  natural or man made disasters in the countries where we sell our products  interruptions in transportation  different labor regulations  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
we depend on distributors to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment 
the failure of our distributors to sell our products and otherwise perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
we rely heavily on our distribution partners to sell our products to end customers  generate a majority of our sales  complete order fulfillment and stock our products 
our distributors also help us to provide technical support and other value added services to end customers 
at times  our sales are concentrated in a small number of distributors  which are in various international locations and are of various sizes and financial strengths 
financial difficulties  inability to access capital markets  or other reasons  may affect our distributors performance  which could materially harm our business and our operating results 
additionally  any reduction in sales efforts  failure to provide good customer service or any other failure to perform by our distributors as expected  could materially reduce our future sales and harm our operating results 

table of contents we rely on our distributors that use the sell through distribution model to produce resale reports that help us in predicting future sales and revenues 
the failure of such distributors to produce accurate and timely resale reports could affect our ability to make these predictions 
during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure its distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
the sell in distribution model allows the company to recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor 
in the sell through distribution model  distributors have price protection and rights of return on unsold merchandise 
consequently  revenue is recognized upon resale to an end customer 
as a result  we expect that the majority of our revenue in fiscal will be reported resale by our sell through distributors 
our distributors that use the sell through distribution model produce resale reports that help us in predicting future sales and revenue recognition 
we depend on the timeliness and accuracy of these resale reports from our distributors  late or inaccurate resale reports could have a detrimental effect on our ability to recognize revenue and our ability to predict future sales 
our entire long term marketable securities portfolio is invested in auction rate securities  which at the time of purchase were investment grade and acquired within the guidelines of our then current investment policy 
subsequent to purchase  these auction rate securities were the subject of multiple failed auctions  which adversely affected their liquidity 
if auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security  auction rate security issuer  the third party insurer of such investments  the issuers of the investments underlying the securities or credit default swaps deteriorate  we may in the future be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through impairment charges  and any of these events could have a materially detrimental effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
at january  and january   the company held auction rate securities with a face value of million and million  respectively 
the company intends to sell its auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or offers become available 
at january   due to continued multiple failed auctions and a determination of illiquidity  the million par value of auction rate securities held by the company had an estimated fair value of million and are classified as long term marketable securities 
long term marketable securities with a par value of million estimated fair value of million are exposed to risks associated with student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program ffelp 
long term marketable securities with a par value of million estimated fair value of million were replaced on december  by auction market preferred shares issued by ambac assurant corporation ambac  as a result of ambac exercising their put option feature provided in this security 
on august   ambac discontinued paying monthly dividends on its auction market preferred shares 
while the auctions for auction rate securities have historically provided a liquid market for these securities  due to liquidity issues in global credit and capital markets  auction rate securities held by us have experienced multiple failed auctions a portion beginning in october 
these instruments are considered illiquid and have been reclassified as long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  the amount realized could be materially different than the estimated fair value amounts at which we are carrying these securities and there could be a materially detrimental effect on our financial results 
our wafer supply could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers and most of our products  including all of our newest products  are manufactured by a sole source 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by fujitsu in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan and chartered semiconductor 
table of contents in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  or if any of our relationships with our partner suppliers are terminated  our operating results could be materially harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundry partners 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity and that of fujitsu for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide or our own increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
during periods of economic uncertainty  our foundry partners may reduce or restructure their operations which may also affect the availability of wafers and adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
all of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabrication facilities located in asia 
additionally  our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  the effects of currency fluctuation  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war  natural disaster  disease or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners wafer costs increase or if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale and our revenue or gross margin could be adversely affected 
we depend on our foundry partners to deliver high quality silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundry partners are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  or wafer costs increase  our operating results could be harmed 
the reliable manufacture of high performance programmable logic devices is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers and ultra pure metals  the absence of defects in production wafers  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and us 
as a result  our foundry partners may periodically increase costs or experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 

table of contents product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and net income 
we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non conformance to our specifications and certain other defects 
because our products  including hardware  software and intellectual property cores  are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology  our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects  whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments 
inability to detect a defect could result in increased engineering expenses necessary to remediate the defect and also result in increased costs due to inventory impairment charges 
on occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components and software or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product defects 
if there are material increases in product defects  the costs to remediate such defects  or the costs to resolve warranty claims compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 
our supply of assembled and tested products could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not assemble our finished products or perform all testing of our products 
currently  our finished products are assembled and may be tested by independent contractors in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea or elsewhere in asia 
if any of our current or future assembly or test contractors significantly interrupts or reduces our supply of assembled and tested devices  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers 
at present  we anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate  however  these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our assembly and test capacity commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining deliveries of finished products consistent with the capacity commitments 
we negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis 
if any of our assembly or test contractors were to reduce its capacity commitment or increase its prices  and we cannot find alternative sources  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our supply of finished products are beyond our control 
because worldwide capacity for assembly and testing of semiconductor products is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall demand or interruptions in supply 
the assembly of complex packages requires a consistent supply of a variety of raw materials such as substrates  leadframes and mold compound 
the worldwide manufacturing capacity for these materials is also limited and inelastic 
a significant industry wide increase in demand  or interruptions in the supply of these materials to our assembly or test contractors  could harm our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our assembly or test contractors operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our supply of assembled and tested devices and could harm our operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenue levels may be affected to a significant extent by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders 
the large number of individual parts we sell and the large number of customers for our products  combined with limitations on our and our customers ability to forecast orders accurately and our relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles  may make it difficult to achieve a match of inventory on hand  production units  and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue projections 

table of contents if our assembly and test supply contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly contractor and us 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
we depend upon a third party to provide inventory management  order fulfillment  and direct sales logistics 
we rely on a third party vendor located in singapore to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
if our third party supply chain partner were to discontinue services for us or its operations are disrupted as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event  our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely  cost effectively  or at all  would be hindered which could harm our business 
if our independent software and hardware developers and suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our contractual requirements  we may face a delay or shortage of the introduction of new products  or the support of existing products 
we rely on independent software and hardware developers for the design  development  supply and support of ip cores  design and development software  and certain elements of demonstration boards 
as a result  failure or significant delay to complete software or hardware under contract to deliver could disrupt the release of or introduction of new products  which might be detrimental to the capability of our new products to win designs 
any of these delays or inability to complete the design or development could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or operating results 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents we are currently implementing a new enterprise wide financial reporting system which may cause operating or reporting disruptions 
in  the company initiated the implementation of an enterprise wide financial reporting erp system to improve processes  enhance the access and timeliness of critical business information and strengthen controls throughout the company 
we currently anticipate converting to this new system later in many companies have experienced operating or reporting disruptions when converting to a new erp system  including limitations on a company s ability to deliver and bill for customer shipments  maintain current and complete books and records  maintain an effective internal control environment and meet external reporting deadlines 
while we do not currently anticipate any significant disruptions to our business  any major difficulty in the conversion to the new reporting system could negatively impact the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
an acquisition may harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
we have made acquisitions in the past to execute on our business strategy which creates uncertainty to our future operating results and cash flows 
we may acquire products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
an acquisition will require considerable management time and may divert time away from operations  require substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt  and involve the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the success of any acquisition requires the integration of products  technologies  personnel and administrate resources  and could result in departures of key personnel  equity dilution or acquisition of unknown liabilities 
as a result  an acquisition could disrupt our operations and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks  and  as a result  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
we carry insurance customary for companies in our industry  including  but not limited to  liability  property and casualty  worker s compensation and business interruption insurance 
we also self insure our employees for basic medical expenses  subject to a true insurance stop loss for catastrophic illness 
in addition  we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  we are self insured with respect to most other risks and exposures  and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies 
based on management s assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is more cost effective to self insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures for which we self insure include  but are not limited to  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  theft  patent infringement and some employment practice matters 
should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology  however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  our competitive position may be harmed or we may face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse affect on our operating results 

table of contents we face risks related to patent litigation 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
for instance  we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims  including the pending patent litigation brought against us by lizy k 
john as described in item legal proceedings  below 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend against the claims 
any such litigation could result in a substantial diversion of our efforts and the use of substantial management and financial resources  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing  however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results

we also lease office facilities in multiple metropolitan locations for our domestic and international sales staff 
we believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and foreseeable future needs 
additionally  we lease a  square foot facility in austin  texas through december as part of our restructuring plan see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in december  we ceased our research and development operations in this location  and have subleased the austin facility through the end of item legal proceedings 
on june   a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by lizy k 
john john against lattice semiconductor corporation in the us district court for the eastern district of texas  marshall division 
john seeks an injunction  unspecified damages  and attorneys fees and expenses 
the company filed a request for re examination of the patent by the united states patent and trademark office pto  which was granted by the pto  and the re examination is in progress 
the litigation has been stayed pending the results of the re examination 
neither the likelihood nor the amount of any potential exposure to the company can be estimated at this time 
we are also exposed to certain other asserted and unasserted potential claims

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview lattice semiconductor corporation lattice or the company designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices pld and field programmable gate arrays fpga each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military end markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities including restructuring charges  income taxes and deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
revenue from sales to customers is generally recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
we sell our products directly to end customers or through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
revenue and cost relating to sell through distributor sales are deferred until either the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges terminate  at which time related distributor resale revenue  effects of distributor price adjustments  and costs are reflected in income 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 
we enter into arrangements with certain sell through distributors to issue accounts receivable credit adjustments distributor advances to reduce the distributors working capital required to service our end customers 
the distributor advances are for estimated future price discounts and are recorded as a reduction of deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
these arrangements are unsecured  bear no interest  are settled on a quarterly basis and are due upon demand 
the distributor advances have no impact on revenue recognition and totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result  we expect the majority 
table of contents of our revenue in fiscal will be from reported resale from our sell through distributors 
resale of product by sell through distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments 
we invest in various financial instruments including corporate and government bonds  notes  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
the company values these instruments at their fair value and monitors its portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge and establishes a new carrying value 
we assess other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the framework under the provisions of asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including market and economic conditions  product lifecycles and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment asc  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
goodwill 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company was below book value 
therefore  the company performed an impairment test on goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the fair value of the company s equity to the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
fair value was based on two primary valuation methodologies the income approach  which used the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach  which used the market capitalization method 
in the allocation  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value  and  as a result  goodwill related to the acquisition of vantis corporation on june   the acquisition of integrated intellectual properties  inc on march   and the acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc on january  totaling million was written off and recorded as an impairment loss on goodwill 
as a result  we no longer have goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents restructuring charges 
expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when incurred under asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  for everything but severance 
because the company has a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
for leased facilities that are vacated  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  is recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
at the end of fiscal years and we no longer have a valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we recognize estimated interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the estimated settlement value of uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
in the first quarter of  we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of substantially all of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of asc option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
restricted stock unit grants are part of the company s equity compensation practices for employees who receive equity grants 
the restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest quarterly over a four year period beginning on the grant date

revenue in fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in revenue from mature and mainstream products  partially offset by an increase in revenue from new products 
in light of the difficult global economic environment  forecasting for all of is particularly challenging and there is limited visibility to the broad market for programmable logic devices  however  the communication market in asia appears to be showing a better than expected revenue trend 
we believe that we will experience an increase in revenue in the first half of  when compared to the first half of revenue by product line from a product line viewpoint  there was a increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal  and a increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal  in fpga units sold primarily driven by an increase in demand for our fpga new products

in the case of sell in distributors and oem customers  revenue is typically recognized  and geography is assigned  when products are shipped to our distributor or customer 
in the case of sell through distributors  revenue is recognized when resale occurs and geography is assigned based on the customer location on the resale reports provided by the distributor 

table of contents revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for export revenue as a percentage of overall revenue increased in fiscal compared to and due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards outsourcing of manufacturing by north american and european customers to asia 
during fiscal the company embarked on a program to restructure its distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result we expect the majority of our revenue in fiscal to be resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  lattice terminated our distribution agreement between lattice and promaster technology corporation on july   between lattice and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between lattice and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
additionally we converted in place distributors in the asia pacific region and europe from a sell in to a sell through model 
as a result  we estimate that revenue was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal by approximately million compared to revenue had we not embarked on this program 
gross margin and operating expenses our gross margin percentage was for fiscal  for fiscal and for the gross margin percentage from fiscal to and fiscal to declined primarily from a decline in revenue from mature products  which typically carry a higher gross margin than our other product categories  as well as revenue growth from new products  which typically carry an initial lower gross margin than our other product categories 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down excess inventory of million  resulting in a charge to cost of products sold 
research and development expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the decrease in compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in labor costs as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in the third and fourth quarters of restructuring plan and december restructuring plan  collectively referred to as the restructuring plans and the full year effect of the restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of restructuring plan  offset by an increase in mask and wafer costs 
the decrease in compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in labor costs as a result of the full year effect of the restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of restructuring plan and the restructuring plan  and a decrease in mask and wafer costs 
the  and restructuring plans are further described below 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm  mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming increasingly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense was lower in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily related to a decrease in labor and facility costs as a result of the and restructuring plans and essentially flat when comparing fiscal with fiscal fiscal year included a reversal of accrued legal costs of million 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company was below book value 
therefore  the company performed an impairment test on goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
we calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimated fair value of the company s equity to the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price 
table of contents allocation in a business combination 
fair value was based on two primary valuation methodologies the income approach  which used the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach  which used the market capitalization method 
in the allocation  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value  and  as a result  goodwill related to the acquisition of vantis corporation on june   the acquisition of integrated intellectual properties  inc on march   and the acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc on january  totaling million was written off and recorded as a non cash impairment loss on goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc and of cerdelinx technologies  inc amortization expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization expense in fiscal  and decreased as a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the agere and cerdelinx acquisitions became completely amortized during each fiscal year 
restructuring activity relates to the restructuring plans implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan  the restructuring plan  the restructuring plan and the restructuring plans 
included in our consolidated statement of operations and reported as restructuring for fiscal is a net charge of million which is comprised of charges of million under the restructuring plans primarily related to severance costs and costs to vacate leased space  and a reversal of less than million under the pre restructuring plans  primarily related to costs to vacate leased properties 
included in our consolidated statement of operations and reported as restructuring for fiscal is a net charge of million which is comprised of charges of million under the restructuring plan primarily related to severance costs and million under the restructuring plan primarily related to severance costs and costs to vacate leased properties 
included in our consolidated statement of operations and reported as restructuring for fiscal  is a net charge of million 
this amount is comprised of charges under the restructuring plan of million  primarily related to a reduction in work force and a voluntary separation program for certain employees partially offset by a reversal of million related to the settlement of the remaining lease obligation for our facility in the united kingdom  which was closed in connection with the restructuring plan 
on january   stephen a 
skaggs  then president and chief executive officer and the company entered into an agreement pursuant to which mr 
skaggs resigned as president and chief executive officer effective may  the company recorded and paid approximately million in severance and related costs in fiscal in addition  the terms of mr 
skaggs severance agreement allowed for a partial acceleration of vesting of previously awarded stock options 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of million in fiscal related to the effects of accelerated vesting 
other income expense  net the following table summarizes the activity in other income expense  net in thousands year ended january  january  december  interest income gain loss primarily related to sale or impairment of auction rate securities  net loss gain and dividend on umc investment gain on debt buyback  net gain on sale of land gain loss on deferred compensation plan assets and other  net total 
table of contents the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in average invested balances as a result of the use of cash for extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in convertible notes and  lower interest rates on invested balances 
the million in gain loss primarily related to sale or impairment of auction rate securities  net  relates primarily to holdings in auction rate securities that are considered illiquid 
gain on debt buyback  net  relates to the extinguishment of convertible notes  net of amortization of associated issuance costs 
provision for income taxes we are paying foreign income taxes  which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations and are primarily related to the cost of operating an offshore research and development subsidiary and sales subsidiaries 
we are not currently paying federal income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes until the benefits of our tax net operating losses are fully utilized

table of contents at january  and january   the company held auction rate securities with a face value of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended january   the company accepted eight redemptions ranging from to of par value of auction rate securities 
the company intends to sell its auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or offers become available 
at january   due to continued multiple failed auctions and a determination of illiquidity  the million par value of auction rate securities held by the company had an estimated fair value of million and are classified as long term marketable securities 
at january   the fair value of auction rate securities held by the company and classified as long term marketable securities was million 
long term marketable securities with a par value of million estimated fair value of million are exposed to risks associated with student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program ffelp 
long term marketable securities with a par value of million estimated fair value of million were replaced on december  by auction market preferred shares issued by ambac assurant corporation ambac  as a result of ambac exercising their put option feature provided in this security 
on august   ambac discontinued paying monthly dividends on its auction market preferred shares  which reduced interest income included in other income expense  net  by less than million per quarter 
while the auctions for auction rate securities have historically provided a liquid market for these securities  due to liquidity issues in global credit and capital markets  auction rate securities held by us have experienced multiple failed auctions a portion beginning in october as the amount of securities submitted for sale at the auctions has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
these instruments are considered illiquid and have been reclassified as long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets 
due to the severity of the decline in fair value  the duration of the decline  and the downgrading of the credit ratings on some of the securities  the company determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred  and recorded additional impairment charges of million for the fiscal year ended january  if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  the amount realized could be materially different than the estimated fair value amounts at which we are carrying these securities and there could be a materially detrimental effect on our financial results 
in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities  the company recorded an unrealized loss of less than million during the year ended january  on certain short term marketable securities  which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
future fluctuations in fair value related to these instruments that the company deems to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended january   approximately million in unrealized gains were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
if the company were to determine in the future that any further decline in fair value is other than temporary  we would record an other than temporary impairment charge  which could have a materially detrimental impact on our operating results 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  it is likely that the amount of any future realized gain or loss would be different from the unrealized gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on december   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which up to million of outstanding common stock may be repurchased from time to time 
the duration of the repurchase program was twelve months  and expired on december  during fiscal  approximately  shares were repurchased for million  all of which were open market transactions and were funded from available working capital 
there were no purchases in fiscal we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing 
table of contents will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution
