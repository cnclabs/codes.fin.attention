item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview startek is a provider of business process outsourcing services 
we partner with our clients to meet their business objectives and improve customer retention  increase revenues and reduce costs through an improved customer experience 
our solutions leverage industry knowledge  best business practices  skilled agents  proven operational excellence and flexible technology 
the startek comprehensive service suite includes customer care  sales support  complex order processing  accounts receivable management  technical and product support and other industry specific processes 
we operate our business within three reportable segments  based on the geographic regions in which our services are rendered the us  canada and offshore 
as of december   our us segment included the operations of our thirteen facilities in the us  our canada segment included the operations of our five facilities in canada  and our offshore segment included the operations of our facility in makati city  philippines 
as of december   there were thirteen  six and one operating centers in the us  canada  and offshore  respectively 
we use gross profit as our measure of profit and loss for each business segment and do not allocate selling  general and administrative expenses to our business segments 
we endeavor to achieve site optimization at all of our operating facilities by routinely evaluating site performance 
if local economic conditions  prevailing wage rates  or other factors negatively impact the long term financial viability of a facility  management will from time to time make the decision to close a facility 
as a result  we may incur impairment losses or restructuring charges in connection with the closure 
likewise  management is continually in pursuit of opportunities to open new facilities in economically viable geographic markets in order to improve profitability and grow the business 
we invoice our clients monthly in arrears and recognize revenue for such services when completed 
substantially all of our contractual arrangements are based either on a production rate  meaning that we recognize revenue based on the billable hours or minutes of each call center agent  or on a rate per transaction basis 
these rates could be based on the number of paid hours the agent works  the number of minutes the agent is available to answer calls  or the number of minutes the agent is actually handling calls for the client  depending on the client contract 
production rates vary by client contract and can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
overall economic conditions have impacted the telecommunications industry and our clients  as the growth in wireless subscribers appears to be slowing 
in addition  the telecommunications space continues to shift away from traditional wireline  or land telephone services  to wireless as many consumers disconnect their home telephone lines in place of using wireless devices 
these industry trends could adversely impact our financial results in  however  we have also observed that our customers are increasingly shifting away from in house call centers and toward outsourced providers as a means of cutting costs 
this trend could positively impact our business in our strategy includes expanding into other vertical markets  including healthcare  insurance and technology  to diversify our client base and reduce our exposure to the telecommunications industry 
finally  we have seen a shift toward offshore services as another avenue to cut costs 
in response to this trend  part of our strategy involves expanding our offshore platform  as described in item business

liquidity and capital resources as of december   working capital totaled million and our current ratio was  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  we have historically financed our operations  liquidity requirements  capital expenditures  and capacity expansion primarily through cash flows from operations  and to a lesser degree  through various forms of debt and leasing arrangements 
in addition to funding basic operations  our primary uses of cash typically relate to capital expenditures to upgrade our existing information technologies and service offerings and investments in our facilities 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by our line of credit will adequately meet our ongoing operating requirements 
we did not draw on our line of credit during  however  due to the timing of our collections of large billings with our major customers  we have historically needed to draw on our line of credit for ongoing operating activities 
we expect to be able to renew our existing line of credit or replace it with other financing arrangements when that line of credit expires on august  if we are unable to renew the line of credit or are unable to secure alternative sources of capital funding under satisfactory terms  or at all  we may be unable to meet cash needs required for growth opportunities 
any significant future expansion of our business may require us to secure additional cash resources 
if we enter into an acquisition  it may require us to use our cash  draw on our line of credit or obtain additional financing  which could decrease cash available for operations 
the current poor conditions of the us credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing and could significantly impact our liquidity 
a decrease in demand for our services  particularly from any of our principal clients  which could arise from a number of factors  including  but not limited to  competitive pressures  adverse trends in the business process outsourcing market  industry consolidation  adverse circumstances with respect to the industries we service  and any of the other factors we describe more fully in item a
