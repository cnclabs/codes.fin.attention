management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth and discussed below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is derived from the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  which are included herein  and should be read in conjunction therewith 
company overview kendle international inc the company or kendle is a global clinical research organization cro that delivers integrated clinical development services  including clinical trial management  clinical data management  statistical analysis  medical writing  regulatory consulting and organizational meeting management and publications services  among other things  on a contract basis to the biopharmaceutical industry 
the company operates in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and africa 
the company operates its business in two reportable operating segments  early stage and late stage 
the early stage business currently focuses on the company s phase i operations while late stage is comprised of clinical development services related to phase ii through iii clinical trials conducted worldwide  late phase clinical development services related to phase iiib and iv clinical trials conducted worldwide  regulatory affairs and biometrics offerings 
the company aggregates its clinical and data monitoring reporting unit  project management and late phase reporting unit  regulatory  site and medical affairs reporting unit  and biostatistics and statistical programming reporting unit into the late stage segment under the aggregation criteria in accounting guidance related to segments 
the aggregation criteria met includes a similar nature of services provided  a similar type of customer  similar methods used to distribute services  similar economic characteristics and a similar regulatory environment 
in addition  the company reports support functions primarily composed of human resources  information technology  sales and marketing and finance under the support and other category for purposes of segment reporting 
a portion of the costs incurred from the support units are allocated to the early and late stage reportable operating segments 
the company s revenue recognition process is described later in this md a under critical accounting policies and estimates 
late stage segment contracts the company provides services to its customers primarily under full service contracts that include a broad range of services in support of all aspects of a customer s clinical trial 
these services typically include biostatistics  clinical development services for phase ii through iv clinical trials and regulatory affairs 
the company from time to time provides a select number of these services under more narrow contracts focusing on one or more specialty areas  referred to as functional service awards 
the company usually competes for business awards in a competitive bidding process 
in the bidding process  the company submits a bid that includes a price based upon hourly billing rates for billable employees multiplied by task hours the company estimates will be necessary to achieve the service assumptions 
upon receiving a business award  the company and its customer negotiate a contract to memorialize these assumptions and the related price 
service contracts usually are long term arrangements that require company performance over several years 
a contract usually requires a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time of contract execution  and the balance is received in specified installments or milestones over the contract s duration 
other methods for receiving payment include units achieved and time and materials 
during performance of the services  any of the following events may occur and impact the contract price the customer may request a change in the assumptions  the customer may increase or decrease the scope of services  which requires a change to the service assumptions  and 
table of contents the company may discover that  for a particular contract  the assumptions are incorrect or insufficient to permit completion of the contract 
in each of the foregoing situations  the company enters into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope or assumptions and the related price 
depending on the complexity of the amendment  the amendment process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment  such as a timeline extension  to several months for a complex amendment  such as a change in patient enrollment strategy 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in limited situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
contract amendments are commonplace within the industry and occur on the majority of the company s contracts 
at any point in time  the company will be in the process of discussing numerous proposed amendments  the scope and value of which can change significantly between time of proposal and final agreement 
the total value of these amendments primarily represents future work and revenues 
in addition to full service and functional service arrangements described above  the company provides consulting services to its customers under contracts that generally are shorter term in nature than full service contracts 
net service revenues from these contracts represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues 
in connection with providing services  the company incurs pass through costs  which include travel related expenses for company employees performing services and fees payable to third party investigators or labs participating in  or supporting  the customer s clinical trial 
the customer agrees to reimburse the company on a dollar for dollar basis for the costs incurred by the company in accordance with contractually specified parameters 
the revenues and costs from these pass through and third party costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 
the customer may terminate the contract at any time with little or no advance notice to the company 
customers  in particular  may terminate a contract immediately for concerns related to the efficacy or safety of a particular drug 
upon termination  the customer is required to pay the company for the value of work completed up to termination as well as reimburse the company for its out of pocket costs incurred in accordance with the contract 
although the majority of the company s contracts are fixed price and net service revenues are calculated on a proportional performance or percentage of completion methodology  the company has seen increasing demand from its customers to move toward a units based contract methodology in new contracts 
it is the company s intent to structure more of its contracts under a units based methodology for calculating net service revenues so the company expects the percentage of contracts under which net service revenues are recognized using units based methodology to increase in future periods 
under a units based contract methodology  amounts recognized as net service revenues are calculated based on units completed in the period multiplied by a unit value or selling price that is outlined in the contract 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and cost estimates  is recognized in revenue calculations beginning in the period in which the parties reach written agreement to the amendment 
early stage segment contracts early stage segment business awards are also subject to a competitive bidding process and  upon award  are memorialized in a contract that includes terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the company s contracts with its late stage segment customers 
most of the revenue for the early stage segment is recognized under units based contracts by multiplying units completed by the applicable contract per unit price 
in general  the early stage segment contract duration is substantially less than that of the late stage segment 
because the early stage business is also subject to the same cancellation risk as the late stage contracts  the company attempts to require the customer to pay a cancellation fee if the customer cancels a project award 
net service revenues from these contracts generally represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues 

table of contents acquisitions in june  the company completed its acquisition of decisionline clinical research corporation decisionline and its related company 
decisionline now kendle toronto is a clinical research organization located in toronto  ontario specializing in the conduct of early phase studies 
the acquisition supports the overall goal of strategic business expansion  and  in particular  expansion of early stage capabilities 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding this acquisition 
the results of operations for acquisitions are included in the company s consolidated statements of operations from the dates of acquisition 
recent developments and cro marketplace the cro industry in general continues to be dependent on the research and development efforts of the principal pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as major customers  and the company believes this dependence will continue 
the loss of business from any of its major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the current economic conditions have created a very challenging climate causing the company to rapidly adjust its strategies and align the workforce to match the demand for its services 
the business climate has caused customers to re evaluate priorities resulting in increases in contracts for the more promising projects  scaling back and or canceling other projects and delaying decisions on others 
the biopharmaceutical industry is reducing costs and  often  their workforce 
the company may benefit from increased outsourcing on the part of its customers or it may be harmed by a reduction in spending 
the company views the current conditions as an opportunity to attract well qualified candidates to strengthen and improve its operations and gain penetration and increase market share as less research and development is done in house by our customers 
another industry trend is the decline in prescription drug sales caused by cost conscious patients opting for less expensive generic drugs or none at all 
this is both an opportunity and a challenge for the company  as its customers will need to find less costly  more efficient research options often through the establishment of strategic alliances or partnerships 
the company believes it is well positioned for this development 
the current economic conditions have also impacted the credit environment  making the obtaining of financing difficult for some customers 
the company is proactively monitoring outstanding accounts receivable and strives to remain in a cash positive position on its riskier customers 
in addition  the volatility of currency exchange rate fluctuations has a significant impact on the company as more of its business is earned outside the united states 
fluctuations in exchange rates are not predictable with any degree of accuracy or foreseeable 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net service revenues information to be discussed regarding segment net service revenues is outlined in the following table year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease net service revenues late stage early stage a support other b total net service revenues a the early stage segment results for the twelve months ended december  include the june acquisition date through december operating results of decisionline

table of contents net service revenues decreased to million for from million in the changes in currency rates reduced net service revenues by approximately for the year net service revenues in the late stage segment decreased approximately to million in compared to million in the declines were driven primarily by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  reductions in the scope of existing projects  cancellations of existing projects and continued delays in the selling cycle  more specifically  advancing contracts from the awarded status to the signed contract status  which prevented the company from commencing work and revenue generating activities 
as mentioned  the company also experienced a significantly higher than normal cancellation rate on previously awarded studies 
the company believes this situation is the result of biopharmaceutical industry merger and acquisition activity  weakness in the current global economy and reduced access to capital  among other things 
additionally  recent pharmaceutical company mergers as well as reduced prescription drug sales and uncertainty in the global economy delayed customer decisions on previously awarded contracts and slowed the contract signature process as pharmaceutical companies re evaluated their pipelines and  in the case of newly merged customers  focused on integration efforts rather than future development of products 
net service revenues in the early stage segment increased approximately  or million to approximately million in compared to million in the majority of this increase is attributable to the kendle toronto acquisition as results contain months of net service revenues from kendle toronto compared to months of net service revenues in this increase was partially offset by the impact of currency rate fluctuations and decreased net service revenues at the phase i unit in the netherlands as a result of the previously mentioned project delays and cancellations

because the bulk of the company s expenses are typically incurred in the late stage and support and other reportable segments  the majority of the costs removed from the business also affect those two segments 
headcount was reduced from approximately  associates at the end of to  associates at the end of this reduction was primarily in the us and western europe and is expected to result in savings of approximately to million in when customer demand increases  the company will be required to increase staffing to deliver services and all of the estimated savings may not materialize 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to a full year of amortization expense in on a customer relationship asset from the kendle toronto acquisition versus seven months in

foreign exchange rates positively impacted cash and cash equivalents by approximately million 
in addition  the company has restricted cash of approximately million at december  compared with  at december   which represents cash received from customers that is segregated in a separate company bank account and available for use only for specific project related expenses  primarily investigator fees  upon authorization from the customer 
because this restricted cash is directly related to operation of the company s business  the activity is included in operating cash flows as opposed to financing cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year consisted primarily of net income adjusted for noncash expenses combined with a reduction in net accounts receivable 
total noncash depreciation  amortization  and debt issuance cost amortization  net of the noncash gain on debt extinguishment totaled million for the year ended december  additionally  in june  the company received cash payments totaling million for 
table of contents tenant improvement allowances as per the terms of the lease for the company s headquarters 
in  changes in operating assets and liabilities provided net cash in the amount of million  driven by collections of accounts receivable 
in  the opposite was the case as the change in net operating assets used million in cash primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in advanced billings 
fluctuations in accounts receivable and advance billings occur on a regular basis as services are performed  milestones or other billing criteria are achieved  invoices are sent to customers and payments for outstanding accounts receivable are collected from customers 
accounts receivable  net of advance billings  decreased from million at december   to million at december  the company has been vigilant in monitoring and collecting its accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable in was primarily due to increased collections particularly in the us and the european subsidiaries  as well as  the decline in revenues 
cash flows used for investing activities for the year ended december  included the use of million for property and equipment additions and million for acquisition of businesses primarily partial payment of accrued contingent consideration combined with the receipt of million from the termination of the existing hedge agreements 
cash flows used for investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of decisionline for million and a million payment to terminate the interest rate collar 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  were million  of which million was used to repurchase million in par value of the company s convertible notes on the open market 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  excluding the offsetting effects of drawdowns and repayments of the credit facility it maintained consisted primarily of million in proceeds from stock option activity 
cash used for capital expenditures was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were primarily related to information technology initiatives 
in march  the company terminated its existing credit agreement including all amendments and related agreements  the old facility and entered into a new credit agreement the facility 
the facility is comprised of a million revolving loan commitment  with up to million of such commitment available for issuance of letters of credit and up to million of such commitment available for same day swing line loans 
at the company s request and with the consent of the current lender or additional lenders  the total commitment may be increased by  or incremental term loans may be obtained for  up to an additional million 
at the company s election  loans under the facility are available either at i an adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin or ii an adjusted libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for each interest rate is calculated in accordance with the terms of the facility 
the facility matures in march  which maturity will accelerate to january  in the event that five percent or more of the currently outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes discussed below have not been redeemed or repaid in full on or prior to january  borrowings under the facility are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets pursuant to the terms of a pledge and security agreement and obligations incurred under the facility are secured by a guaranty in favor of various secured parties 
the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including those regarding limitations on the company s ability to incur certain indebtedness  limitations on certain investments  limitations on capital expenditures in any fiscal year and limitations on certain acquisitions and asset sales outside the ordinary course of business as well as financial covenants regarding limitations on the company s total leverage ratio  senior secured leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio 
the company is in compliance with the covenants as of the date it entered into the facility 
in connection with the termination of the old facility  the company intends to write off approximately  in unamortized fees during the first quarter of the company also maintains an existing million multicurrency facility that is renewable annually and is used in connection with the company s european operations 
in july   the company issued million of year convertible notes with a maturity date of july  the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year 
the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into cash and  if 
table of contents applicable  shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share approximating shares per  principal amount of the convertible notes  upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  upon events defined as a fundamental change under the convertible note indenture  holders of the convertible notes may require the company to repurchase the convertible notes 
if upon the occurrence of such events in which the holders of the convertible notes exercise the conversion provisions of the convertible notes  the company will need to remit the principal balance of the convertible notes to the holders in cash 
as such  the company would be required to classify the entire amount outstanding of the convertible notes as a current liability in the following quarter 
the evaluation of the classification of amounts outstanding associated with the convertible notes occurs every quarter 
as of december   the convertible notes are classified as long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  the company purchased convertible bond hedges from two counterparties which are designed to mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the company s common stock at the time of exercise is greater than approximately 
in addition  the company issued warrants to the counterparties that could require the company to issue shares of the company s common stock at a strike price of per share 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to approximately per share of kendle common stock  representing approximately a premium based on the closing sale price as reported on the nasdaq global market on july   of per share 
in  the company repurchased million in par value of its convertible notes on the open market for cash of million 
the amortized carrying value of these repurchased notes was million and a non cash net gain of million was recorded 
as part of the repurchase transaction  the proportionate share of debt issuance costs in the amount of  was written off 
this transaction is expected to result in reduced cash interest expense and noncash discount amortization of million over the remaining term of the convertible notes 
of the consideration paid to repurchase the convertible notes   was allocated to the equity component 
this is considered to be a reacquisition of a portion of the equity component of the convertible notes and as such is recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
additionally  the related bond hedge and warrant transactions were proportionately unwound at a cost of  as of december   million in par value was outstanding under the convertible notes  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit the company maintained and no amounts were outstanding under the multicurrency facility 
the company s primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and facility related expenses 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the facility and the multicurrency facility  will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs for both the short and long term 
the company has not historically experienced regular liquidity or collections issues with the large majority of its customers 
however  the company does have contracts with biotechnology and small pharmaceutical companies  some of which are dependent upon external financing to fund their contractual commitments 
the company is continuing to monitor the financial status of its customers 
as more of the company s revenues are generated in locations other than the us  repatriation of those cash flows in a tax efficient manner is increasingly challenging 
in the future  the company will continue to consider the acquisition of businesses to enhance its service offerings  therapeutic base and global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financings and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available on terms acceptable to the company 

table of contents contractual obligations future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows year years years years after total in thousands capital lease obligations including interest operating leases debt payments interest on debt reserve for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties total short term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
under the terms of the convertible notes  the convertible notes are convertible into shares of the common stock upon the occurrence of various factors described in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis 
the above table assumes no conversion with the remaining principal amount of the convertible notes paid at the maturity date of july  the interest rate used in the calculation of interest was which represents the cash coupon obligation 
reserves for uncertain tax positions of million have not been reflected in the above table due to the inherent uncertainty as to the amount and timing of settlement  which is contingent upon the occurrence of possible future events  such as examinations and determinations by various tax authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated financial statements for a particular period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s net service revenues are based on fixed price contracts calculated on a proportional performance basis also referred to herein as percentage of completion based upon assumptions regarding the estimated total costs for each contract 
the company also recognizes revenue under units based contracts by multiplying units completed by the applicable contract per unit price 
additionally  work is performed under time and materials contracts  recognizing revenue as hours are worked based on the hourly billing rate for each contract 
percentage of completion with respect to certain fixed price contracts  costs are incurred for performance of each contract and compared to the estimated budgeted costs for that contract to determine a percentage of completion on the contract 
the percentage of completion is then multiplied by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue recognized 
the contract value equals the value of the services to be performed under the contract as determined by aggregating the labor hours estimated to be incurred to perform the tasks in the contract at the agreed rates 
contract value excludes the value of third party and other pass through costs 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be changed as a result of management s regular contract review process 
management regularly reviews the budget on each contract to determine if the budgeted costs accurately reflect the costs that the company will incur for contract performance 
the company reviews each contract s 
table of contents performance to date  current cost trends and circumstances specific to each contract 
the company estimates its remaining costs to complete the contract based on a variety of factors  including actual costs incurred to date and the work completed as a result of incurring the actual costs  the remaining work to be completed based on the timeline of the contract as well as the number of incomplete tasks in the contract  and factors that could change the rate of progress of future contract performance 
examples of factors included in the review process that could change the rate of progress of future contract performance are patient enrollment rate  changes in the composition of staff on the project or other customer requirements  among other things 
based on these contract reviews  the company adjusts its cost estimates 
adjustments to net service revenue resulting from changes in cost estimates are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
when estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided in the current period in its entirety 
while the company routinely adjusts cost estimates on individual contracts  the company s estimates and assumptions historically have been accurate in all material respects in the aggregate 
the company expects the estimates and assumptions to remain accurate in all material respects in the aggregate in future periods 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and cost estimates  is recognized in the percentage of completion calculations beginning in the period in which the parties reach written agreement to the amendment 
see also company overview section of md a for a description of the contract amendment process 
historically  the aggregate value of contract amendments signed in any year represents to of annual sales 
although the majority of the company s contract amendments relate to future services  the company and its customers may execute contract amendments for services that the company already has performed 
in these circumstances  net service revenue from past services performed is recognized in the current period 
historically  the impact of such amendments on results of operations has not been material 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in limited situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
when work progresses on unsigned  unprocessed contract amendments  the company reviews the direct costs incurred  and  where material defers such costs on the balance sheet 
in addition  the impact of such costs on the estimates to complete is considered and  where material  the estimates are adjusted 
historically  neither the deferred costs nor the impact on estimates have been material 
the company believes that total costs constitute the most appropriate indicator of the performance of fixed price contracts because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the contract 
the customer receives the benefit of the work performed throughout the contract term and is obligated to pay for services once performed 
accordingly  the company believes that an input measure of cost is a reasonable surrogate for an output measure under the proportional performance model and is consistent with the revenue recognition concepts issued by the sec 
units based although the majority of the company s contracts are fixed price and net service revenues are calculated on a percentage of completion methodology as discussed above  the company has seen increasing demand from its customers to move to a units based contract methodology in new contracts 
it is the company s intent to structure more of its contracts under a units based methodology for calculating net service revenues so the company expects the percentage of contracts under which net service revenues are recognized using units based methodology to increase in future periods 
under a units based contract methodology  amounts recognized as net service revenues are calculated based on units completed in the period multiplied by a unit value or selling price that is outlined in the contract 
for a units based contract  a typical unit could include such things as completion of a monitoring visit  monthly site management units or case report form pages entered 
the company tracks the units completed for each unit 
table of contents category included in the contract 
net service revenue is recognized monthly based on the units actually completed in the period at the agreed upon unit value or selling price 
net service revenue is recognized only up to the number of units contained in each contract 
if the company completes or expects to complete units over and above the number of units initially estimated and contained in the contract  a contract amendment is generated to reflect the additional units needed 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and expected units or unit values  is recognized in the unit based net service revenue calculations beginning in the period in which the parties agree to the amendment 
see also company overview section of md a for a description of the contract amendment process 
the company believes that under certain types of contracts the value of the work performed is best captured by calculating net service revenues using the value of units completed 
the company believes that units based revenue recognition is consistent with the revenue recognition concepts issued by the sec 
as the company provides services on projects  it also incurs third party and other pass through costs  which are reimbursable by its customers pursuant to the contract 
the revenues and costs from these third party and other pass through costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 
direct costs direct costs consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related associates  unreimbursed project related costs and an allocated portion of indirect costs  which primarily includes facilities related costs and information systems costs 
labor costs represent over of total direct costs with the allocated portion of indirect costs and other expenses representing the remainder 
to determine the allocated portion of indirect costs  the company calculates an allocation percentage based on the relationship between billable associate salaries and total salaries 
the remaining indirect costs are allocated to sg a 
because the company s business is labor intensive  direct costs historically have increased with an increase in net service revenues 
the company  however  has not experienced any material variations in the relationship between direct costs and net service revenues for the fiscal years ended   and the following factors  among others  may cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of net service revenues higher utilization rates for billable employees  and the ability to complete contracted work more efficiently than estimated by the company 
the following factors  among others  will cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of net service revenues the occurrence of cost overruns from increased time to complete contract performance  lower utilization rates for billable employees  increased costs due to higher paid employees or contractors performing contract services  and pricing pressure from increased competition 
other costs selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales and administrative employees and professional services  as well as unallocated costs related to facilities  information systems and other costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization costs recorded on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the property or equipment and internally developed software 
finite lived intangible assets are generally amortized on an accelerated basis based on the discounted cash flow calculations used in the valuation of the asset 

table of contents accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been issued to customers 
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been issued to customers 
advance billings represent amounts billed or payment received for which revenues have not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical evidence of accounts receivable collections and specific identification of accounts receivable that might pose collection problems 
the bad debt reserve is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover any bad debt write offs 
the company will continue to monitor its bad debt exposure and adjust bad debt reserves as necessary 
if the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there could be a material impact to the company s consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
goodwill and intangible assets the company analyzes goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets to determine any potential impairment loss annually in the fourth quarter  unless conditions exist that require an updated analysis on an interim basis 
during  management concluded that there was no evidence of events triggering an interim evaluation 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
the fair value approach compares estimates related to the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value is determined using both the market approach and the income approach using projected discounted cash flows 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the company has five reporting units that were tested for impairment early stage  and the late stage reporting units consisting of clinical and data monitoring  project management and late phase services  regulatory  site and medical affairs and biostatistics and statistical programming 
the company made some changes to its four late stage segment reporting units in in conjunction with its internal reorganization 
the company s late stage reporting units have historically had  individually and in the aggregate  a significant amount of fair value in excess of carrying value 
the company evaluated the goodwill for the late stage reporting units under the previous reporting unit structure and determined that there was no indication of impairment at the time the reporting units were reorganized 
the company determined its reporting units using the guidance related to accounting for goodwill 
this guidance defines a reporting unit as the components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
at december  and  the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment charge 
as of december   the goodwill assigned to each unit as well as the percentage by which their fair values exceeded their carrying values are as follows goodwill fair value in excess of allocated carrying value in thousands clinical and data monitoring project management late phase regulatory  site and medical affairs biostatistics and statistical programming early stage total the estimate of fair value is inherently subjective and requires the company to make a number of assumptions and projections 
these assumptions and projections relate to revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures and future market conditions  among other things 
the most significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing were revenue growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the revenue growth rates are forward looking and by their nature are uncertain 
the company may or may not be able to achieve the estimated growth rates and or margin rates 
the rates used were  in general  approximately the same for the early stage reporting unit and more conservative than 
table of contents have been used in the past for the late stage reporting units because of the current economy and reduced long term outlook for the pharmaceutical and cro industries 
the wacc rate for the early stage reporting unit is higher than the rate used in the wacc rates used for the late stage units are not materially different with those used in prior year evaluations 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in estimating fair value of its long lived assets  the estimated fair value of these assets could change and result in impairment charges 
see item a  risk factors for discussion of risks and potential risks that may impact future net service revenues  among other things  of the company 
internally developed software pursuant to the accounting guidance related to the capitalization of software developed or obtained for internal use  the company capitalizes costs incurred to internally develop software used primarily in the company s proprietary clinical trial and data management systems  and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product  not to exceed five years 
internally developed software represents software in the application development stage  and there is no assurance that the software development process will produce a final product for which the fair value exceeds its carrying value 
internally developed software is an intangible asset subject to impairment write downs whenever events indicate that the carrying value of the software may not be recoverable 
as with other long lived assets  this asset is reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriateness of the carrying value of the asset and the estimated useful lives 
assessing the fair value of the internally developed software requires estimates and judgment on the part of management 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  internally developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
the company believes the useful life established remains reasonable 
tax valuation allowance and tax liabilities the company follows the guidance related to accounting for uncertainties in income taxes 
this guidance requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgments as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and  consequently  the company s operating results 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
at december   the company has recorded a gross liability for uncertain income tax positions of million 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment  a tax expense or benefit to expense  respectively  would result 
the company provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes 
specifically  the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient pretax income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
if estimates prove inaccurate or if the tax laws change unfavorably  significant revisions in the valuation allowance may be required in the future 
stock based compensation the company follows the guidance related to accounting for share based payments 
the company generally uses the straight line method of recording compensation expense relative to share based payment  unless awards 
table of contents have graded vesting features and the expense recorded under the straight line method is not adequate 
in those situations  compensation cost is recognized separately over each tranche 
stock based compensation expense is recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations as the majority of the stock option expense relates to options granted to executives 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the calculation of stock based compensation in future periods  the compensation expense that the company records may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its amounts outstanding under the facility and multicurrency facility 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under either the old facility or the multicurrency facility and as of the date of this form k  no amounts are outstanding under the facility 
foreign currency the company operates on a global basis and is therefore exposed to various types of currency risks 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts the company executes with its customers 
from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net service revenues and resultant net income or loss can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  the company recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing at the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment from the customer is received will result in the company receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by the company as a foreign currency 
table of contents transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a third type of transaction risk arises from transactions denominated in multiple currencies between any two of the company s various subsidiary locations 
for each subsidiary  the company maintains an intercompany receivable and payable  which is denominated in multiple currencies 
changes in exchange rates from the time the intercompany receivable payable balance arises until the balance is settled or measured for reporting purposes  results in exchange rate gains and losses 
this intercompany receivable payable arises when work is performed by a kendle location in one country on behalf of a kendle location in a different country under contract with the customer 
additionally  there are occasions when funds are transferred between subsidiaries for working capital purposes 
where possible  the company settles these intercompany balances frequently to reduce this exposure 
the foreign currency transaction gain or loss is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded total foreign exchange gains of million compared to losses of approximately million in related to the risks described above 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments  which are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
foreign currency hedges in  the company entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate exposure in movements between the us dollar and british pounds sterling and us dollar and euro 
the hedging transactions were designed to mitigate the company s exposure related to two intercompany notes between the company s us subsidiary  as lender  and the company s subsidiaries in each of the united kingdom and germany 
the note between the company s us subsidiary and united kingdom subsidiary is denominated in pounds sterling and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  in january  the company eliminated a substantial portion of this note leaving a remaining balance outstanding at december  of million 
the hedge agreement related to this loan was terminated in january resulting in million of cash proceeds 
the company recorded foreign exchange gains of  related to the pound sterling loan in prior to the termination of the pound sterling hedge in january  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of million 
the note between the company s us subsidiary and german subsidiary was denominated in euros and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  this note was repaid in full in march  and the related hedge agreement was terminated at the same time 
foreign exchange losses of million and gains of  were recorded related to the euro note and the euro hedge agreement  respectively  prior to their repayment and termination in march the hedge agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under accounting guidance related to derivatives and all changes in the fair market value of the hedge were recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded gains of approximately million on the euro hedge transactions and gains of approximately million on the pound sterling transaction related to the changes in the fair market value of the hedge 
the gains on the fair market value of the hedge were offset by foreign exchange losses of approximately million on the change in value of the euro intercompany note and million on the change in value of the pound sterling intercompany note
