the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements and item a risk factors each included in this annual report on form k 
business overview sparton is a provider of complex and sophisticated electromechanical devices with capabilities that include concept development  industrial design  design and manufacturing engineering  production  distribution  and field service 
the company operates predominantly in three markets medical device  electronic manufacturing services and defense security systems 
in fiscal  management initiated a full evaluation of our operations  including operating structure 
this evaluation resulted in changes in fiscal to our analysis of how the components of sparton s business contribute to consolidated operating results and the overall level of desegregation of reported financial data  including the nature and number of operating segments  disclosure of segment information and the consistency of such information with internal management reports 
effective for fiscal  we report our operating results under these three reportable business segments 
prior to fiscal  all of our operating units were aggregated into one line of business  ems 
the prior period presented herein reflects this change to segment reporting 
all of the company s facilities are registered to iso standards  including or  with most having additional certifications 
the company s products and services include products for original equipment manufacturers oem and emerging technology et customers that are microprocessor based systems that include transducers  printed circuit boards and assemblies  sensors  and electromechanical components  as well as development and design engineering services relating to these product sales 
sparton also develops and manufactures sonobuoys  an anti submarine warfare asw device  used by the united states navy and other free world countries 
many of the physical and technical attributes in the production of sonobuoys are similar to those required in the production of the company s other electrical and electromechanical products and assemblies 
the company uses an internal management reporting system  which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the company s resources on a market segment basis 
net sales for segments are attributed to the segment in which the product is manufactured or service is performed 
a segment s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income loss 
a segment s operating income loss includes its gross profit on sales less its selling and administrative expenses  but excludes some corporate and other unallocated items such as  interest expense  interest income  other income expense and income tax expense benefit 
corporate and other unallocated costs primarily represent corporate administrative expenses related to those administrative  financial and human resource activities which are not allocated to operations and excluded from segment profit 
these costs are not allocated to the segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments 
inter segment transactions are generally accounted for at amounts that approximate arm s length transactions 
the accounting policies for each of the segments are the same as for the company taken as a whole 
medical device medical operations are comprised of contract development  design  production and distribution of complex and sophisticated medical related electromechanical devices for customers with specialized needs  specifically in the design and manufacturing process  to assure product reliability and safety in accordance with food and drug administration fda guidelines and approvals 
this group specializes in systems and procedures targeted to the requirements of medical oem and et customers primarily in the in vitro diagnostic and therapeutic device segments of the medical device market space 

table of contents electronic manufacturing services ems operations are comprised of contract manufacturing  assembly  design  preproduction  prototyping and or box build assembly for customers supporting the industrial  security sensing  medical  aerospace  defense  energy and telecommunications markets 
these assemblies include flight control systems  fuel control systems for aerospace  medical diagnostics systems  security systems  detection systems  lighting and defense 
assemblies provided to this group s customers are state of the art electronics  complex and legacy products circuit card assemblies and or electromechanical assemblies in support of their products 
ems provides to its customers support services that include engineering services  design  material management  obsolescence analysis and management  documentation development  and process improvement 
the segment strives to exceed customer s expectations of low cost and delivery performance 
the common elements generally shared by ems customers that produce the aforementioned products is the expectation of compliance to market quality certifications coupled with component cost reduction and continuous process improvements 
defense security systems dss operations are comprised of design  development and production of products for a number of technologically significant programs aimed at fulfilling defense and commercial needs 
specializing in the development and production of complex electromechanical equipment  sparton designs and manufactures sonobuoys  an anti submarine warfare asw device used by the us navy and foreign governments 
this business unit also performs an engineering development function for the united states military and prime defense contractors on advanced technologies targeted as future defense products as well as replacement of current systems 
the sonobuoy product line is built to the customer s demanding specifications 
these products are itar restricted  which limits opportunities for competition 
risks and uncertainties sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low to medium volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact our operating results if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  sharp volatility of world financial markets over a short period of time  competition in the overall contract manufacturing business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation  customer labor and work strikes  and uncertainties related to defects discovered in certain of the company s aerospace circuit boards 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials  as well as non cancelable purchase orders we have committed to in relation to customer forecasts that can be subject to change 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components due to strong market demand  this resulted in higher prices and or late deliveries 
in addition  some electronics components used in production are available from a 
table of contents limited number of suppliers  or a single supplier  which may affect availability and or pricing 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to the test range and successful passage of product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
additional risk factors that have arisen more recently include dependence on key personnel  recent volatility in the stock markets and the impact on the company s pension plan 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of  and more recently the frank dodd act have required or will require changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and the new york stock exchange also passed rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs and may increase these costs further in the future 
a further discussion of the company s risk factors is included in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  
table of contents which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of sparton s board of directors

as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
advance billings in excess of inventoried costs are included in current liabilities 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant government contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment 
these allowances are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
as of june  and  the valuation allowances totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in 
table of contents full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts considered necessary was approximately million both at june  and if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant  have generally not exceeded management s expectations  and the allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  asc topic 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of asc topic are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
during the quarter ended june   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was completed 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense prior to curtailment and settlement expenses for fiscal was calculated to be million compared to million for fiscal effective april   participation and the accrual of benefits in the company s pension plan were frozen  at which time all participants became fully vested 
as a result of this freeze  an approximate million curtailment charge was recognized during the year ended june   related to the acceleration of all remaining prior service costs previously being amortized over future periods 
in addition  lump sum benefit distributions during fiscal and fiscal exceeded plan service and interest costs  resulting in lump sum 
table of contents settlement charges of approximately million and million also being recognized during the respective years 
these settlement charges resulted from several business and economic factors that have affected the measurement of the plan s projected benefit obligation in recent years  including the recent management actions described above  changes in the plan s benefit formula  the timing of participants retirement  changes in assumed interest rates  variation in investment returns  and the amounts of lump sum distributions paid 
the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note  employee retirement benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
business combinations the company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
accordingly  the company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values 
transaction and integration costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill while any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain 
the company makes various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as fair value is a market based measurement  it is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use 
the most significant assumptions typically relate to the estimated fair values of inventory and intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
management arrives at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and is inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
valuation of property  plant and equipment the company records an impairment charge on our investment in property  plant and equipment that we hold and use in our operations if and when management determines that the related carrying values may not be recoverable 
if one or more impairment indicators are deemed to exist  sparton will measure any impairment of these assets based on current independent appraisals or a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated operating results and are subject to many factors 
during the years ended june  and  the company recognized impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to the restructuring related activities  primarily related to the closures of the company s jackson  michigan  london  ontario  canada and albuquerque  new mexico facilities 
goodwill and customer relationships the company annually reviews goodwill associated with its investments in astro for possible impairment 
this analysis may be performed more often should events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the astro impairment analysis is a two step process 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of astro to its carrying value 
if the fair value of astro exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform 
table of contents further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to astro exceeds the fair value of astro  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of astro 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
additionally  the company performs impairment testing of an amortized intangible asset whenever indicators are present that an impairment of the asset may exist 
if an impairment of the asset is determined to exist  the impairment is recognized and the asset is written down to its fair value  which value then becomes the new amortizable base 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment is prohibited 
determining the fair value of any reporting unit and intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and  if appropriate  determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of the company s reporting units 
the most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis related to the company s astro investment was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal that impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
the next such impairment reviews are expected to be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
future taxable income depends on the ability to generate income in excess of allowable deductions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  an expense benefit is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  significant judgment and estimates would be required in determining how to account for uncertain tax positions the company might take in the next twelve months 
the company believes its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
pursuant to fasb asc topic  no liability has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  the company recorded restructuring accruals  principally as a result of contract termination costs  work force reductions  plant and other facility closings  and related equipment transfers and associated activities 
generally costs associated with restructuring activities are recognized only when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property ceases to be used or is vacated 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such restructuring activities  this process can involve periodic 
table of contents reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to periodically record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
stock based compensation asc topic  share based payment  requires significant judgment and the use of estimates in the assumptions for the model used to value the share based payment awards  including stock price volatility  and expected option terms 
in addition  expected forfeiture rates for the share based awards must be estimated 
because of our small number of option grants during our history  we are limited in our historical experience to use as a basis for these assumptions 
while we believe that the assumptions and judgments used in our estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures its products in the united states and vietnam 
we ceased manufacturing in canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales are to the us as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian and vietnamese financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings

historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
however  due to the greater volatility of the canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation losses increased in fiscal with the closure of the canadian facility  however  the impact in fiscal has not been significant and it is anticipated that future periods will not be significant 

table of contents the company s revolving credit line  if drawn upon  is subject to future interest rate fluctuations which could potentially have a negative impact on cash flows of the company
