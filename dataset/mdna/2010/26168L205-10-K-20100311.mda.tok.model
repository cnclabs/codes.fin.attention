item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we describe in detail the effect on our operations of the substantial decline in sales in both the rv segment and the mh segment during and briefly  during  as a result of the severe economic downturn and the resulting decline in shipments by the rv and manufactured housing industries  the two industries to which we sell our products  we suffered a percent decline in our sales from million in to million in our net income declined percent from million in to million in  after giving effect to million of after tax charges related to goodwill impairment and executive retirement 
during the first six months of  the economy and the industries we serve remained weak 
as a result  we experienced a percent decline in our sales from million in the first six months of to million in the first six months of in the first six months of  we reported a net loss of million  including a non cash after tax charge of million related to a goodwill impairment  as compared to net income of million in the first six months of the decline in our results for and the first six months of would have been substantially greater had it not been for an aggressive program of cost cutting measures and efficiency improvements implemented beginning in the latter part of  as well as the introduction of a variety of new products 
the benefits of these cost cutting measures will be realized for years to come 
collectively  the fixed cost reductions since have improved our annual operating profit by nearly million as compared to what our results would have been if these steps had not been taken 
during the second half of  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market  increased percent compared to the second half of  while manufactured housing industry wide production declined by percent 
as a result  our sales increased to million in the second half of  or percent over the same period in  and we reported net income of million in the second half of as compared to a net loss of million in the comparable period of our sales for the first two months of more than doubled to over million  compared to less than million in the same period of  when most rv producers were shut down for extended periods of time 
nearly all of this increase was in sales of the company s rv products 
sales of manufactured housing products increased approximately percent as compared to the first two months of on february   the recreational vehicle industry association rvia published its latest forecast of industry wide wholesale shipments for  which projects a percent increase in the shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to there is no assurance that this rv industry wide wholesale shipments level will be achieved 
there are no industry forecasts for the manufactured housing industry 
liquidity during  in large part because of inventory reduction  as well as cost cutting and efficiency improvements  the company generated significant cash flow 
as a result  at december   the company had no debt and million in cash and short term investments 
the company and its subsidiaries have a million revolving line of credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na and wells fargo bank  na  which expires in december  and a million shelf loan facility with prudential investment management  inc and its affiliates  which expires in november aggregate borrowing availability under these facilities at december  was million

mh segment through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the company manufactures and markets a number of components for new and aftermarket manufactured homes and  to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts axles entry doors in  the mh segment represented percent of the company s consolidated net sales  and percent of consolidated segment operating profit 
certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
the mh segment also supplies related products to other industries  representing less than percent of sales of this segment 
raw materials used by the company s mh segment  consisting of fabricated steel coil  sheet  and i beam  extruded aluminum and vinyl  glass  and abs resin  are available from a number of sources  both domestic and foreign

detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the mh segment is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing other than the activities of its sales personnel and maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service  and customer satisfaction  the company does not engage in significant marketing efforts  and does not incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures 
the company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months  however  in certain cases the company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty days notice 
both the rv segment and the mh segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and  as a result  neither segment has any significant backlog 
the company s operations are somewhat seasonal  as sales are typically slower in the first and fourth quarters  consistent with the industries which the company supplies 
capacity in  the company s facilities operated at an average of approximately percent of their practical capacity  and typically ran one shift of production per day 
therefore  when demand increased in the rv industry in the latter part of  the company had the ability to increase production  and could substantially increase production should demand increase further in the rv or manufactured housing industries 
due to seasonal demand  capacity utilization varies during the year 
capacity utilization also varies significantly by product line and geographic region 
at december   the company operated facilities  and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities  but the company would incur additional freight costs 
capital expenditures for were million 
the ability to expand capacity in certain product areas  if necessary  as well as the potential to reallocate existing resources  is monitored regularly by management

item a 
risk factors 
industry risk factors economic and business conditions beyond our control have had a significant adverse impact on our earnings  and these conditions may continue 
our net sales in fell percent compared to  which adversely impacted our operating results 
we attribute this decline to a combination of factors  including the weak economy and resulting recession  tight credit  low consumer confidence  and the deterioration in the real estate and mortgage markets 
as a result of these conditions  which may continue  dealers reduced inventories and consumers have been cautious about making purchases of discretionary big ticket items such as rvs and manufactured homes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the severe decline in the retail demand and wholesale production of rvs and manufactured homes has reduced the demand for our products 
our annual results of operations could decline if industry conditions worsen 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing limits the inventories carried by retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes  which causes reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes and reduced demand for our products 
retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing known as floor plan financing provided by lending institutions 
reduction in the availability of floor plan financing would cause many dealers to reduce inventories of rvs and manufactured homes  which would result in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
moreover  dealers which are unable to obtain adequate financing could cease operations 
their remaining inventories would likely be sold at deep discounts 
such sales would cause a decline in orders for new inventory  which would reduce demand for our products 
the recession and conditions in the credit market have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to obtain financing for rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
as a result of the recession and the factors leading to it  there have been significant changes in the lending practices of financial institutions  and many lenders have severely restricted loan availability 
limitations on the availability of financing for rvs and manufactured homes limit the ability of consumers to purchase rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production  and reduced demand for our products 
limited availability of financing for manufactured homes and higher costs of this financing limits the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  which would result in reduced demand for our products 
loans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates  and are more difficult to obtain than mortgages for site built homes 
historically  lenders required higher down payment  higher credit scores and other criteria for these loans 
current lending criteria are even higher  and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify 
the availability  cost  and terms of these loans are also dependent on economic conditions  lending practices of financial institutions  governmental policies  and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of manufactured homes and reduced demand for our products 
excess inventories at dealers and manufacturers can cause a decline in the demand for our products 
as a result of the severe decline in sales of rvs and manufactured homes  dealers and manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes carried excess unsold inventory 
existence of excess inventory can cause a reduction in orders for new rvs and manufactured homes  which would cause a decline in demand for our products 
high levels of repossessions of manufactured homes and rvs could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
repossessed manufactured homes and rvs are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices  which reduces the demand for new manufactured homes and rvs 
economic conditions could result in loan defaults and cause high levels of repossessions  which would cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
gasoline shortages  or high prices for gasoline  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  components for which represent nearly percent of our rv segment sales  are usually towed by light trucks or suvs 
generally  these vehicles use more fuel than automobiles  particularly while towing rvs 
high prices for gasoline  or anticipation of potential fuel shortages  can affect consumer use and purchase of light trucks and suvs  which would result in reduced demand for fifth wheel rvs and travel trailers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
disposition into the market by fema of rvs or manufactured homes could result in reduced demand for our products 
from time to time  fema purchases rvs or manufactured homes for use in connection with natural disasters or other circumstances resulting in home displacements 
used or unused rvs or manufactured homes may later be disposed of by fema by sale or otherwise 
disposition of these rvs and manufactured homes in the market could reduce demand for new rvs and manufactured homes causing manufacturers to reduce production  which would result in reduced demand for our products 
the manufactured housing industry has been experiencing a significant decline in shipments  which may continue 
our mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  operates in an industry which has been experiencing a decline in production of new homes since the downturn was caused  in part  by limited availability of financing  and has been exacerbated by economic conditions 
moreover  because of the weak market for conventional housing  retirees may not be able to sell their primary residences  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase less expensive manufactured homes 
in addition  the availability of foreclosed site built homes at reduced prices could impact the demand for manufactured homes 
if these conditions persist  it is not likely that the manufactured housing industry will improve in the short term  and certain of our customers could experience financial difficulties 
these factors could result in reduced demand for products from our mh segment  as well as difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
changes in zoning regulations for manufactured homes could lead to reduced demand for our products 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning regulations 
in the past  there has been resistance by local property owners and zoning officials to zoning ordinances allowing the location of manufactured homes in certain areas comprised of conventional residences 
continued resistance to these zoning ordinances could have an adverse impact on sales and production of manufactured homes  which would reduce demand for our products 
recently enacted legislation and regulatory changes relating to the financial services industry could impact the industries we serve which could result in reduced demand for our products 
the secure and fair enforcement for mortgage licensing act of safe act was signed into law in july  the safe act is intended to establish  within one year from its passage  minimum state standards for licensing and registration of mortgage lenders  brokers and originators 
according to the rvia and the manufactured housing institute  this legislation could make loans for rvs and manufactured homes more difficult to obtain  resulting in fewer sales of rvs and manufactured homes  and less demand for our products 
company specific risk factors volatile raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
the prices we pay for steel  which represents about percent of our raw material costs  and other key raw materials  have been volatile 
because competition and business conditions may limit the amount or timing of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to customers in the form of price increases  future increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
conversely  as raw material costs decline  we may not be able to maintain selling prices consistent with higher cost raw materials in our inventory  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inadequate supply of raw materials used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
if raw materials or components that are used in manufacturing our products  particularly those which we import  become unavailable  or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected 
the company currently imports approximately percent of its raw materials and components 
we are involved in certain litigation  which  if decided against us  could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
a case is pending against kinro  purporting to be a class action  in which it is alleged that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro for use in manufactured homes fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread 
kinro denies the allegations  is vigorously defending against the claims  and based on extensive investigation  believes that the bathtubs are in compliance with applicable regulations 
further detail regarding the litigation is provided in this form k in item legal proceedings 
the loss of any customer accounting for more than percent of our consolidated net sales  and the consolidation of customers in our industry  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
one customer of the rv segment accounted for percent  and another customer of both the rv segment and the mh segment accounted for percent  of our consolidated net sales in the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  the concentration of sales of our products to fewer customers as a result of consolidation of manufacturers in the industries we serve could adversely impact our operating results 
the financial condition of several of our significant customers could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
financial difficulties experienced by certain of our significant customers as a result of the sharp decline in sales of rvs and manufactured homes could result in reduced demand for our products  as well as losses due to the inability to collect accounts receivable 
competitive pressures could reduce demand for our products 
domestic and foreign competitors may lower prices on products which currently compete with our products  or develop product improvements  which could reduce demand for our products 
in addition  the manufacture by our customers of products supplied by us could reduce demand for our products 
non cash charges for impairment of long lived other intangible assets may be required 
the declines in the industries to which we sell our products have been severe  and demand for our products has declined 
continuation of the decline in these industries could result in non cash impairment charges

item legal proceedings 
on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california  entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
on april   the court issued an order granting drew s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  resulting in the dismissal of drew industries incorporated as one of the defendants in the case 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread established by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act cal

et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiff s attorneys fees 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzalez as the class representative because she no longer owned the bathtub 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations 
on june   plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and the court again denied certification of a class 
plaintiffs filed a third motion for class certification on december   and defendants filed a motion seeking summary judgment against plaintiffs case 
on may   the court issued an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of defendants  dismissing five of the six claims asserted by plaintiffs  except for plaintiffs claim for violation of california s unfair competition law the ucl 
the court also granted plaintiffs motion for class certification as to that one claim 
the court denied defendant s motion for summary judgment on the ucl claim on the ground that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the alleged misrepresentation on defendants labels regarding testing for flame spread rate caused plaintiffs to purchase the manufactured homes containing bathtubs manufactured by kinro 
on august   as a result of a decision by the california supreme court in an unrelated case dealing with a similar ucl claim  the court dismissed plaintiffs remaining ucl claim because plaintiffs did not actually rely on defendants labels when they bought the homes containing the bathtubs 
however  the court concluded that simply selling bathtubs which may fail to satisfy federal standards may violate the unfair prong of the ucl  even if plaintiffs did not actually rely on defendant s labels 
on september   defendants filed with the ninth circuit court of appeals a petition for permission to appeal  on an interlocutory basis  that part of the district court s ruling that certified a class to pursue a claim under the unfair prong of the ucl 
on december   the appeals court issued an order denying defendants permission to appeal the district court s ruling at this point in the case  but the appeals court did not address the merits of the case 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
based on the foregoing investigation and testing  the district court s rulings dismissing plaintiffs six claims  and the ruling on reliance by the california supreme court  kinro believes that  notwithstanding the district court s finding that plaintiffs may proceed with their claim that defendants may have violated the unfair prong of the ucl  plaintiffs may not be able to prove the essential elements of their claim 
defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claim  and intend to move for summary judgment dismissing the claim 
in addition  kinro believes that no remedial action is required or appropriate under hud safety standards 
if the district court maintains its rulings  denies defendants motion for summary judgment as to the claim based on the unfair prong of the ucl  and maintains its ruling granting plaintiffs motion for class certification with respect to that claim  and if plaintiffs pursue their claim  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
the company s liability insurer denied coverage on the ground that plaintiffs did not sustain any personal injury or property damage 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations

the company has two reportable segments  the recreational vehicle rv products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment 
the company s operations are conducted through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert 
each has operations in both the rv and mh segments 
at december   the company operated plants in states 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of rvs  including towable rv steel chassis aluminum windows and screens towable rv axles and suspension solutions chassis components rv slide out mechanisms and solutions furniture and mattresses thermoformed bath  kitchen and other products entry and baggage doors toy hauler ramp doors entry steps manual  electric and hydraulic stabilizer other towable accessories and lifting systems specialty trailers for hauling boats  personal watercraft  snowmobiles and equipment nearly percent of the company s rv segment sales are of products used in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
the balance represents sales of components for motorhomes and mid size buses  and sales of specialty trailers  as well as axles for specialty trailers 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent and percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in and  respectively  up from percent in the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  and percent for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts axles entry doors the company also supplies replacement windows  doors  and thermoformed bath products for existing manufactured homes 
sales of products other than components for rvs and manufactured homes are not considered significant 
however  certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
the company s operations are somewhat seasonal  as sales are typically slower in the first and fourth quarters  consistent with the industries which the company supplies 
industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational  camping  travel or seasonal use 
rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers  fifth wheel travel trailers  folding camping trailers and truck campers 
during  and continuing into the first six months of  retail sales of rvs declined because of severe economic conditions  including low consumer confidence  limited credit availability for both dealers and consumers  and continued weakness in the real estate and mortgage markets 
as a result  rv dealers reduced their inventory levels  and rv manufacturers significantly reduced their output 
according to the recreation vehicle industry association rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv markets  declined percent to  units for the first six months of  which reduced sales by the company of components for new rvs 
however  during the second half of  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs increased percent compared to the second half of  to  units 
this year over year increase in industry wide wholesale shipments during the second half of was reportedly due to a modest restocking of inventory by dealers  as compared to a significant inventory reduction by rv dealers in the comparable period of  as well as a modest improvement in retail demand in november and december while the company measures its rv sales against industry wide wholesale shipment statistics  it believes the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand 
through the first months of and all of  retail sales remained below prior year levels 
however  in november and december  monthly retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs exceeded the comparable period in the prior year  the first increases in months 
a comparison of the year over year percentage change in industry wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  is as follows wholesale retail quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  retail statistics  reported by statistical surveys  inc  do not include sales of rvs in canada 
the rvia reported that over one in five wholesale towable rv shipments were to dealers in canada in statistics for wholesale towable rv shipments to canada for are not yet available 
during and the first eight months of  rv dealers and their lenders focused on reducing inventories  resulting in a decline of an estimated  units 
in alone  dealer inventories of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs declined by an estimated  to  units  implying that retail demand significantly exceeded industry wide wholesale shipments 
over the past few months  it appears that dealer inventories have stopped declining  and as a result  production levels have increased in order to meet demand 
recent dealer surveys and analysts report a slight improvement in the availability of wholesale financing 
in addition  reports of increased consumer traffic and consumer purchases from january and february rv tradeshows  as well as the reported increase in backlog by the leading producer of rvs  have been encouraging 
while these positive factors may indicate the beginning of a trend  there are still uncertainties relating to high unemployment  tight credit and a weak economy 
retail sales in the traditionally strong spring selling season will be a key indicator of consumer demand for rvs 
the rvia has projected a percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs for  to  units 
following the last three recessions  industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs grew by more than percent in the first year of the recovery 
however  consumer confidence and the availability of financing have historically been important factors in the overall growth in the rv industry  and there can be no assurance these factors will improve 
in the long term  the company expects rv industry sales to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the us population 
us census bureau projections released in march project that there will be in excess of million more people over the age of by in  the rvia began a generic advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle 
the current phase is targeted at both parents aged with children at home  as well as couples aged with no children at home 
the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events  and using rvs as second homes  also appears to motivate consumer demand for rvs 
manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis  transported to a home site  and installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction  strength and durability  transportability  fire resistance  energy efficiency and quality 
the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
it is the only federally regulated national building code 
on site additions  such as garages  decks and porches  often add to the attractiveness of manufactured homes and must be built to local  state or regional building codes 
a manufactured home may be sited on owned or leased land 
the institute for building technology and safety ibts reported that for  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were  units  a decline of percent compared to however  estimates are that in  manufactured housing dealers reduced inventory by approximately  units  implying that retail demand in was higher than wholesale shipments 
since  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes have declined percent 
this decade plus decline was primarily the result of limited credit availability because of high credit standards applied to purchases of manufactured homes  high down payment requirements  and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and loans for manufactured homes 
in addition  in the several years leading up to  many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site built homes instead of manufactured homes  as subprime mortgages were readily available at unrealistic terms 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
for  larger multi section manufactured homes represented percent of the total manufactured homes produced  consistent with  but down significantly from the percent in multi section manufactured homes contain more of the company s products than single section manufactured homes 
the decline in multi section homes over the past few years may be partly due to the weak site built housing market  as a result of which many retirees have not been able to sell their primary residence  or may have been unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase a more affordable manufactured home as many retirees had done historically 
legislation enacted in july increased federal housing administration fha insured lending limits for chattel mortgages for manufactured homes chattel loans are loans secured only by the home which is sited on leased rather than owned land from less than  to nearly  subject to future adjustments based on inflation 
the final regulations for the insured lending limits were put into place in march the american recovery and reinvestment act of also authorized a tax credit of the lesser of percent of the purchase price  or  for qualified first time home buyers purchasing a principal residence during  which applies to manufactured housing 
the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of extended the tax credit until april   and also authorized a tax credit of up to  for qualified repeat home buyers 
the impact of these programs on manufactured housing has been modest so far  and any future impact on demand for new manufactured homes cannot be determined at this time 
the secure and fair enforcement for mortgage licensing act of safe act was signed into law in july  the safe act is intended to establish  within one year from its passage  minimum state standards for licensing and registration of mortgage lenders  brokers and originators 
according to the rvia and the manufactured housing institute  that legislation could make loans for rvs and manufactured homes more difficult to obtain  resulting in fewer sales of rvs and manufactured homes 
the company believes the manufactured housing industry may begin to experience a modest recovery once the recession ends and home buyers begin to look for affordable housing 
however  because of the current real estate and economic environment  volatile consumer confidence  and tight retail and wholesale credit markets  the company currently expects industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low for at least the first half of there are no industry forecasts for the manufactured housing industry 
the company also believes that long term growth prospects for manufactured housing may be positive because of i the quality and affordability of the home  ii the favorable demographic trends  including the increasing number of retirees who  in the past  had represented a significant market for manufactured homes  iii pent up demand by retirees who have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence and purchase a manufactured home  and iv the unavailability of subprime mortgages for site built homes

as a result  the company s net sales increased to million in the second half of  percent more than in the comparable period of the company reported net income of million in the second half of as compared to a net loss of million in the comparable period of  which included an after tax charge of million for goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the company s net sales for the first two months of more than doubled to over million  compared to less than million in the same period of  when most rv producers were shut down for extended periods of time 
nearly all of this increase was in sales of the company s rv products 
sales of manufactured housing products increased approximately percent as compared to the first two months of on february   the rvia published its latest forecast of industry wide wholesale shipments for  which projects a percent increase in the shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to there is no assurance that this rv industry wide wholesale shipments level will be achieved 
there are no industry forecasts for the manufactured housing industry 
in response to the impact of the recession  the company focused on increasing market share for existing products  introducing new products  reducing fixed costs  improving efficiencies  and strengthening its financial condition 
in  the company identified and introduced new and improved rv products that focused on consumer safety and convenience  including the quick bitetm coupler  an improved suspension system  entry doors with alarm systems and keyless entry  and a new look line of windows 
as a result  the company s rv segment continued to achieve market share gains 
the company s furniture products continued to gain market share 
the company s average furniture content per travel trailer and fifth wheel produced by the rv industry for was per unit  an increase of per unit  or percent  from the average content when seating technology  inc and its affiliates seating technology was acquired in july in july  a supplier of manufactured housing windows and doors exited the market 
since then  the company has gained new window business of more than million on an annualized basis 
in addition  in september  the company purchased production equipment and inventory for manufactured housing entry doors from the same supplier  entering a new million to million market 
approximately half of this new potential is in aftermarket replacement entry doors for manufactured homes 
the company began production of manufactured housing entry doors during the fourth quarter of  and is gaining market share 
the company s mh segment aftermarket sales  primarily comprised of windows and thermoformed bath products  were approximately million to million for  consistent with  and could increase as a result of the company s increased effort to gain market share in aftermarket products 
on february  the company reported that lippert agreed in principle to acquire certain intellectual property and other assets from michigan based schwintek  inc the purchase would include several products for which patents are pending  including innovative rv wall slides that are considerably lighter  more space efficient  and more reliable than previous slide out designs 
the purchase price  undisclosed at the time of the announcement  is expected to include cash payable at closing  plus an earn out depending on future unit sales 
it is expected that the cash portion of the purchase price payable at closing will be funded from available cash 
closing of the transaction is subject to completion of due diligence  agreement on final terms and conditions  the execution of definitive transaction documents  and satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
the decline in the company s results for would have been substantially greater had it not been for an aggressive program of cost cutting measures and efficiency improvements implemented beginning in the latter part of cost reduction measures benefitted the company s operating results in by million  compared to  and will further benefit operating results by million 
collectively  the fixed cost reductions since have improved the company s annual operating profit by nearly million compared to results if these steps had not been taken 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of the fixed cost reductions and production efficiencies implemented will continue even as sales increase 
during and  as a result of the unprecedented conditions in the rv and manufactured housing industries  and the cost cutting measures taken by management  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of extra expenses 
these extra expenses resulted primarily from the following in millions plant closings and start ups obsolete equipment  inventory and tooling staff reductions and relocations executive retirement other during  the company continued to generate significant cash flow  increasing cash and short term investments by nearly million  to over million  and paying off the entire million debt balance that existed at december  this was largely accomplished by cash flows provided by operating activities of million  including a reduction in inventory of more than million 
steel and aluminum are among the company s principal raw materials 
since late  the costs of steel and aluminum have been volatile 
during the first half of  raw material costs temporarily declined  but subsequently increased percent to percent in the second half of  depending upon the type of raw material 
the company anticipates that these cost increases will reduce operating profit in  although the impact is expected to be modest 
while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset the majority of raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that future cost increases  if any  can be partially or fully passed on to customers 
the company also continues to explore improved product design  efficiency improvements  and alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestic and imported 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in decreased percent  or million  compared to due to an organic sales decline excluding the impact of acquisitions and sales price changes of approximately million 
this percent organic sales decline during was due to the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market 
during the first six months of the organic sales decline of rv related products was approximately million  or percent 
however  this was partially offset by an organic sales increase of approximately million  or percent  of rv related products in the second half of an organic sales decline of approximately percent or million in specialty trailers due primarily to a severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium size boats  particularly on the west coast  the company s primary specialty trailer market 
partially offset by full year impact in of acquisitions completed in  aggregating approximately million 
sales price increases of approximately million  primarily due to raw material cost increases in the company s rv segment aftermarket sales were approximately million for  consistent with  and could increase as a result of the company s increased effort to gain market share in new aftermarket products 
the trend in the company s average product content per rv is an indicator of the company s overall market share 
content per rv is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs  for the years ended december  divided by the industry wide wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv content per motorhome content per all rvs the above product content per rv for the year ended december  includes historical sales results for acquisitions  under the assumption the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of that yearly period 
the company s average product content per type of rv does not include sales of replacement parts to aftermarket customers 
prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation 
according to the rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows percent change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes all rvs operating profit of the rv segment in decreased million compared to  largely due to the million decline in sales  and million of extra expenses in related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  increased bad debts  and obsolete inventory and tooling  compared to million of extra expenses in excluding extra expenses  the company s rv segment had an operating profit of million in  a decrease of million from the segment operating profit of million in this adjusted decline in rv segment operating profit was percent of the organic decline in net sales  a smaller percentage decline than the company would typically expect 
the operating margin of the rv segment in was positively impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures which reduced cost of sales 
lower health insurance costs largely due to the implementation of a new plan 
lower warranty costs 
lower raw material costs in the second half of compared to the same period of when raw material costs were unusually high  partially offset by higher raw material costs during the first six months of depending upon the type of raw material  costs have recently risen percent to percent 
partially offset by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
higher overtime and labor inefficiencies due to rapid changes in sales volumes 
excluding the extra expenses  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  largely due to the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base  partially offset by the implementation of fixed cost reductions 
in addition  incentive compensation was lower as a percent of sales in because incentive compensation is only recorded on operating profit in excess of pre established hurdles 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in decreased percent  or million  from excluding million in sales price increases  net sales of the mh segment declined percent compared to the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes 
the company s sales decline was greater than the manufactured housing industry decline due partly to a decline in modular and office units 
in addition  changes in market share by certain producers of manufactured homes have had a negative impact on sales of the company s products 
in july  a supplier of manufactured housing windows and doors exited the market 
since then  the company has gained new window business of more than million annually  partially offsetting the other declines 
in addition  in september  the company purchased production equipment and inventory for manufactured housing entry doors from the same supplier  entering a new million to million market 
approximately half of this new potential is in aftermarket replacement entry doors for manufactured homes 
the company began production of manufactured housing entry doors during the fourth quarter of  and is gaining market share 
the company s mh segment aftermarket sales  primarily comprised of windows and thermoformed bath products  were approximately million to million for  consistent with  and could increase as a result of the company s increased effort to gain market share in aftermarket products 
the trend in the company s average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the company s overall market share 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
content per manufactured home and content per floor is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for manufactured homes produced for the years ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the years ended december  was as follows percent change content per home produced content per floor produced the company s average product content per manufactured home does not include sales of replacement parts to aftermarket customers 
prior periods have been adjusted to conform to this presentation 
according to the ibts  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows percent change total homes produced total floors produced operating profit of the mh segment in decreased million compared to  largely due to the million decline in sales 
in addition  the company had million and million of extra expenses in and  respectively  related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  and obsolete inventory 
excluding extra expenses  the company s mh segment had an operating profit of million in  a decrease of million from the segment operating profit of million in the same period last year 
the adjusted decline in mh segment operating profit was percent of the organic decline in net sales  a smaller percentage decline than the company would typically expect 
the operating margin of the mh segment in was positively impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures which reduced cost of sales 
lower raw material costs 
however  depending upon the type of raw material  costs have recently risen percent to percent 
lower health insurance costs largely due to the implementation of a new plan 
partially offset by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
labor inefficiencies due to the sharp drop in sales 
excluding the extra expenses  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in due largely to the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base  partially offset by fixed cost reductions 
also  incentive compensation was lower as a percent of sales in because year to date operating profit for certain mh segment operations were below the previously established annual incentive compensation hurdles 
the company has remained profitable in the mh segment despite the percent decline in manufactured housing industry shipments since the company did not have an impairment of other intangible assets or long lived assets in related to its manufactured housing operations  however  the company will continue to monitor these assets for potential impairment  as a continued downturn in this industry or in the profitability of the company s operations  could result in a non cash impairment charge of these assets in the future 
at december   the other intangible assets of the mh segment aggregated million 
corporate corporate expenses for decreased million compared to due primarily to fixed cost reductions 
goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  because the company s stock price on the new york stock exchange was below its book value  and due to the continued declines in industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs and manufactured homes  the company conducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill of each of its reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated with a discounted cash flow model utilizing internal forecasts and observable market data  to the extent available  to estimate future cash flows  and the company s weighted average cost of capital of percent 
the forecast included an estimate of long term future growth rates based on management s most recent views of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
based on the analyses  the carrying value of the rv and manufactured housing reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step of the impairment test  which required the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of each reporting unit  excluding goodwill 
the results of the second step implied that the fair value of goodwill was zero  therefore during the first quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge to write off the entire million of goodwill of these reporting units 
other non segment items other non segment items include the following in thousands year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses legal proceedings gain on sold facilities loss on sold facilities and write downs to estimated current fair value of facilities to be sold incentive compensation impact of other non segment items other executive retirement other income from the collection of a previously reserved note total other non segment items year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for  excluding the impact of sales price increases and acquisitions  decreased million percent from  primarily as a result of the percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in  as well as a percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes 
in addition  sales were negatively affected by the percent decline in industry wide wholesale shipments of motorhomes  and the severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium sized boats  particularly on the west coast  for which the company supplies specialty trailers 
net income for decreased percent from  primarily due to the decrease in net sales and higher raw material costs 
in addition  the company recorded a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill  as well as an executive retirement charge  aggregating million after taxes 
in response to reduced retail sales during and inventory reductions by rv dealers  rv manufacturers significantly reduced their output  which negatively affected the company in in response to the difficult economic environment  the company was extremely proactive and took the following steps reduced its workforce and production capacity to be more in line with anticipated demand 
closed facilities and reduced fixed overhead costs 
implemented synergies between the operations of kinro and lippert by combining certain administrative functions and sales efforts 
these factors positively affected the company s operating profit in by approximately million  compared to these steps also lowered the company s breakeven sales level 
on november   the company entered into an agreement for a million line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank  na and wells fargo bank  na simultaneously  the company entered into a million shelf loan facility with prudential investment management  inc and its affiliates 
at december   the collective availability under these facilities was million

contingencies on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california  entitled gonzalez vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skylines homes  inc case no 
cv 
the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated in california 
plaintiff initially alleged  but has not sought certification of  a national class 
on april   the court issued an order granting drew s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  resulting in the dismissal of drew industries incorporated as one of the defendants in the case 
plaintiff alleges that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread established by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiff alleges  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act cal

et seq plaintiff seeks to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiff s attorneys fees 
on january   the court issued an order denying certification of a class with plaintiff gonzalez as the class representative because she no longer owned the bathtub 
on march   plaintiff amended her complaint to include an additional plaintiff  robert royalty 
plaintiff royalty states that his bathtub was not tested to determine whether it complies with hud standards 
rather  his allegations are based on information and belief  including the testing of plaintiff gonzalez s bathtub and other evidence 
kinro denies plaintiff royalty s allegations 
on june   plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and the court again denied certification of a class 
plaintiffs filed a third motion for class certification on december   and defendants filed a motion seeking summary judgment against plaintiffs case 
on may   the court issued an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of defendants  dismissing five of the six claims asserted by plaintiffs  except for plaintiffs claim for violation of california s unfair competition law the ucl 
the court also granted plaintiffs motion for class certification as to that one claim 
the court denied defendant s motion for summary judgment on the ucl claim on the ground that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the alleged misrepresentation on defendants labels regarding testing for flame spread rate caused plaintiffs to purchase the manufactured homes containing bathtubs manufactured by kinro 
on august   as a result of a decision by the california supreme court in an unrelated case dealing with a similar ucl claim  the court dismissed plaintiffs remaining ucl claim because plaintiffs did not actually rely on defendants labels when they bought the homes containing the bathtubs 
however  the court concluded that simply selling bathtubs which may fail to satisfy federal standards may violate the unfair prong of the ucl  even if plaintiffs did not actually rely on defendant s labels 
on september   defendants filed with the ninth circuit court of appeals a petition for permission to appeal  on an interlocutory basis  that part of the district court s ruling that certified a class to pursue a claim under the unfair prong of the ucl 
on december   the appeals court issued an order denying defendants permission to appeal the district court s ruling at this point in the case  but the appeals court did not address the merits of the case 
defendant kinro has conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  prior test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro s initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro s bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
based on the foregoing investigation and testing  the district court s rulings dismissing plaintiffs six claims  and the ruling on reliance by the california supreme court  kinro believes that  notwithstanding the district court s finding that plaintiffs may proceed with their claim that defendants may have violated the unfair prong of the ucl  plaintiffs may not be able to prove the essential elements of their claim 
defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claim  and intend to move for summary judgment dismissing the claim 
in addition  kinro believes that no remedial action is required or appropriate under hud safety standards 
if the district court maintains its rulings  denies defendants motion for summary judgment as to the claim based on the unfair prong of the ucl  and maintains its ruling granting plaintiffs motion for class certification with respect to that claim  and if plaintiffs pursue their claim  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
the company s liability insurer denied coverage on the ground that plaintiffs did not sustain any personal injury or property damage 
in connection with a tax audit by the indiana department of revenue pertaining to calendar years to  the company received an initial examination report asserting  in the aggregate  approximately million of proposed tax adjustments  including interest and penalties

the aggregate settlement amount was fully reserved prior to  and was paid in april of in connection with the settlement  the indiana department of revenue reserved the right to examine tax years through in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces accounts receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in assessing the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company considers such factors as the current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
to the extent that actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors  including the company s i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales patterns 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
income taxes the company s tax benefit provision is based on pre tax loss income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax benefit provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that the tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test as of november th each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
in  the company conducted its annual impairment analysis of the goodwill in all reporting units  which resulted in the impairment and non cash write off of the entire million of goodwill related to the specialty trailer reporting unit 
during the first quarter of  because the company s stock price on the new york stock exchange was below its book value  and due to the continued declines in industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs and manufactured homes  the company also conducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill of each of its reporting units  resulting in the impairment and non cash write off of the remaining million of goodwill 
in both periods  the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated with a discounted cash flow model utilizing internal forecasts and observable market data  to the extent available  to estimate future cash flows 
the forecast included an estimate of long term future growth rates based on management s most recent views of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
at march  and december   the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model prepared for the goodwill impairment analysis was percent and percent  respectively  derived by applying the weighted average cost of capital model which weights the cost of debt and equity financing 
the company also considered the relationship of debt to equity of other companies similar to the respective reporting units  as well as the risks and uncertainty inherent in the markets generally and in the company s internally developed forecasts 
based on the analyses  the carrying value of the rv  manufactured housing and specialty trailer reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step of the impairment test  which required the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of each reporting unit  excluding goodwill 
the results of the second step implied that the fair value of goodwill was zero  therefore the company recorded a non cash impairment charge to write off the entire goodwill of these reporting units 
these non cash goodwill impairment charges were largely the result of uncertainties in the economy  and in the rv  manufactured housing and marine and leisure industries  as well as the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected cash flows 
estimating the fair value of reporting units  and the reporting unit s asset and liabilities  involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections and market data 
actual results may differ from forecasted results 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including  but not limited to  those related to product returns  accounts receivable  notes receivable  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  segment allocations  earn out payments  and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
the company did not experience any significant increase in its labor costs in related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has historically been exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings 
at december   the company had million of cash equivalents and million of short term investments in us treasuries with a current yield of approximately percent 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for these fixed rate investments subsequent to december   and total investments of million  future cash flows would be million lower per annum than if the fixed rate investment could be obtained at current market rates 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  or the outstanding borrowings change significantly  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above
