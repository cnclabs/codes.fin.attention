item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business continuity and property insurance for such emergencies 
a significant change in the climate of the world could affect the general growth in the economy  population growth and create other issues which will over time affect returns on financial instruments and thus the financial markets in general 
it is impossible to predict such effects on the company s business and operations 
risks associated with the company s stock 
the company s stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it difficult for an investor to resell shares of the company s class a stock at the times and at the prices desired 
the price of the class a stock can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the company  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  perceptions in the marketplace regarding the company and or its competitors  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the company or its competitors  a downturn in the overall economy or the equity markets in particular  failure to effectively integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  and the occurrence of any of the other events described in these risk factors 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause the company s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 
the trading volume in the company s class a stock is less than that of larger financial services companies 
although the company s class a stock is listed for trading on the nyse  the trading volume in its class a stock is less than that of larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the company s class a stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the company has no control 
given the lower trading volume of the company s class a stock  significant sales of shares of the company s class a stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause the company s stock price to fall and increases the volatility of the class a stock generally 
the holders of class a stock do not have the ability to vote on most corporate matters which limits the influence that these holders have over the company 
the company issues two classes of shares  class a stock and class b voting common stock class b stock 
at december   there were  shares of class b stock outstanding compared to  shares of class a stock 
the voting power associated with the class b stock allows holders of class b stock to effectively exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  and other matters affecting the company 
as of february   over of the class b voting shares are held by an entity controlled by mr 
albert lowenthal  the chairman and ceo of the company 
this concentration of class b voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company or may result in the receipt of a control premium by the controlling stockholder in the event of a sale of stock which premium would not be received by the holders of the class a stock 
the controlling stockholder may have potential conflicts of interest with other stockholders 
possible additional issuances of the company s stock will cause dilution 
at december   the company had  shares of class a stock outstanding  outstanding employee stock options to purchase a total of  shares of class a stock  as well as outstanding unvested stock awards granted for an additional  shares of class a stock 
the company is further authorized to issue up to  shares of class a stock under share based compensation plans  for which stockholder approval has already been obtained 
as part of the consideration for the new capital markets business  the company issued to cibc warrants to purchase  shares of class a stock on january  at an exercise price of per share 
the company may also issue class a stock in an indeterminate amount as payment for cibc s earn out in the new capital markets business for the five year period ending in as the company issues additional shares  stockholders holdings will be diluted  perhaps significantly

the company and its subsidiaries own no real property  but at december   occupied office space totaling approximately million square feet in locations under standard commercial terms expiring between and if any leases are not renewed  the company believes it could obtain comparable space elsewhere on commercially reasonable rental terms 
item legal proceedings many aspects of the company s business involve substantial risks of liability 
in the normal course of business  the company has been the subject of customer complaints and has been named as a defendant or co defendant in various lawsuits or arbitrations creating substantial exposure 
the incidences of these types of claims have increased since the onset of the credit crisis and the resulting market disruptions 
the company is also involved from time to time in certain governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings 
these proceedings arise primarily from securities brokerage  asset management and investment banking activities 
there has been an increased incidence of regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years  including customer claims  which seek substantial penalties  fines or other monetary relief 
while the ultimate resolution of routine pending litigation and other matters cannot be currently determined  in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the company does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
however  the company s results of operations could be materially affected during any period if liabilities in that period differ from prior estimates 
notwithstanding the foregoing  an adverse result in any of the matters set forth below  many of which are at a preliminary stage  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  including its cash position 
the materiality of legal matters to the company s future operating results depends on the level of future results of operations as well as the timing and ultimate outcome of such legal matt ers 
see risk factors the company may be adversely affected by the failure of the auction rate securities market  factors affecting forward looking statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory environment

reference is made to the order between the msd and oppenheimer et al  attached to this annual report as exhibit  for additional details of the agreement with the msd

nbsp  oppenheimer s initial purchase offer and additional purchase offers will remain open for a period of seventy five days from the date on which the offer to purchase is sent

each of the aod and the order provides that in the event that oppenheimer enters into another agreement that provides any form of benefit to any oppenheimer ars customer on terms more favorable than those set forth in the aod or the order  oppenheimer will immediately extend the more favorable terms contained in such other agreement to all eligible investors 
in the case of the order  it is limited to more favorable agreements entered into subsequent to the february  order while in the case of the aod  it covers more favorable agreements entered into prior and subsequent to the february  aod

reference is made to the aod between the nyag and oppenheimer  attached to this annual report as exhibit  for additional details of the agreement with the nyag 
the company is continuing to cooperate with investigating entities from other states 
oppenheimer offered ars to its clients in the same manner as dozens of other downstream firms in the ars marketplace as an available cash management option for clients seeking to increase their yields on short term investments similar to a money market fund 
the company believes that oppenheimer s participation therefore differs dramatically from that of the larger broker dealers who underwrote and provided supporting bids in the auctions and who subsequently entered into settlements with state and federal regulators  agreeing to purchase billions of dollars of their clients ars holdings 
unlike these other broker dealers  oppenheimer did not act as the lead or sole lead managing underwriter or dealer in any ars auctions during the relevant time period  did not enter support bids to ensure that any ars auctions cleared  and played no role in any decision by the lead underwriters o r broker dealers to discontinue entering support bids and allowing auctions to fail

critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
financial instruments and fair value financial instruments securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased  investments and derivative contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period 
the company s other financial instruments are generally short term in nature or have variable interest rates and as such their carrying values approximate fair value  with the exception of notes receivable from employees which are carried at cost 
financial instruments used for asset and liability management the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk on its variable rate senior secured credit note 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under the accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the swap hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in the month london interbank offering rate libor 
the company utilizes an interest rate cap agreement to manage interest rate risk on its variable subordinated debt 
the cap has been designated as a cash flow hedge under the accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the cap hedge are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in the month libor rate 
fair value measurements effective january   the company adopted the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of financial assets  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy  and expands fair value measurement disclosures 
fair value  as defined by the accounting guidance  is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy established by this accounting guidance prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three categories highest to lowest priority level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs 
the company s financial instruments are recorded at fair value and generally are classified within level or level within the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices or quotes from market makers or broker dealers 
financial instruments classified within level are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets and consist of us government  federal agency  and sovereign government obligations  corporate equities  and certain money market instruments 
level financial instruments primarily consist of investment grade and high yield corporate debt  convertible bonds  mortgage and asset backed securities  municipal obligations  and certain money market instruments 
financial instruments classified as level are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active 
some financial instruments are classified within level within the fair value hierarchy as observable pricing inputs are not available due to limited market activity for the asset or liability 
such financial instruments include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds where the company is general partner  less liquid private label mortgage and asset backed securities  certain distressed municipal securities  and auction rate securities 
a description of the valuation techniques applied and inputs used in measuring the fair value of the company s financial instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appearing in item fair value option the company has the option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period 
the company may make a fair value option election on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument 
the company has elected to apply the fair value option to its loan trading portfolio which resides in opy credit corp 
and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
management has elected this treatment as it is consistent with the manner in which the business is managed as well as the way that financial instruments in other parts of the business are recorded 
there was one loan position held in the secondary loan trading portfolio at december  with a par value of  nil in a nd a fair value of  which is categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy 
loans and allowances for doubtful accounts customer receivables  primarily consisting of margin loans collateralized by customer owned securities  are charged interest at rates similar to other such loans made throughout the industry 
customer receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company reviews large customer accounts that do not comply with the company s margin requirements on a case by case basis to determine the likelihood of collection and records an allowance for doubtful accounts following that process 
for small customer accounts that do not comply with the company s margin requirements  the allowance for doubtful accounts is generally recorded as the amount of unsecured or partially secured receivables 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors as part of its hiring process 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
legal and regulatory reserves the company records reserves related to legal and regulatory proceedings in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the company establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are probable and estimable 
when the contingencies are not probable and estimable  the company does not establish reserves 
when determining whether to record a reserve  management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  specifically in the case of client litigation  the amount of the loss in the client s account and the possibility of wrongdoing  if any  on the part of an employee of the company  the bas is and validity of the claim  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal and regulatory proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the results of that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal or regulatory proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount

new accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appearing in item business environment the securities industry is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities and changes in interest rates  inflation  political events  investor participation levels  legal and regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements and competition  all of which have an impact on commissions  firm trading  fees from accounts under investment management as well as fees for investment banking services  and investment income as well as on liquidity 
substantial fluctuations can occur in revenues and net income due to these and other factors 
at year end  the us economy has emerged from the longest contraction since the great depression 
unemployment continues at very high levels and uncertainty continues to plague the economy as we await the reversal of stimulative policies from the federal reserve and a determination of national policies for major segments of the economy including healthcare and the financial system 
other economic indicators are showing improvement including increased manufacturing activity  higher commodity prices and higher end sales to consumers and businesses 
the real estate markets are sending mixed signals with significant deterioration in commercial real estate prices but improvements in the housing market across most of the country 
improving market conditions since march  buoyed by low interest rates and discretionary funds for investment  have led to overall revenue improvements for the company in each successive quarter of revenue from commissions and principal transactions in the three and twelve months ended december  surpassed levels achieved in comparable periods in as a result of the effects of rising equity prices and the credit markets recovery from distressed levels 
the strength in revenue from principal transactions was largely due to the company s significant progress in building its fixed income division as well as strong debt markets throughout the year 
revenue for the company from investment banking activities remains disappointing as many mid sized and smaller companies continue to face restricted access to the capital markets  although there were significant signs of improvement in that sect or in the fourth quarter of net interest revenue for the company  as well as fees derived from money market funds and fdic insured deposits of clients  continue to be significantly and adversely affected by the low interest rate policies that have been designed to stimulate the economy 
asset management advisory fees increased in the fourth quarter of due to incentive fees earned on certain managed funds compared to the prior year 
while most expense categories showed significant decreases compared to the prior year  the company s compensation levels as a percentage of revenue remained at high levels as a result of increased stock based and deferred compensation which reflected the significant improvement in the company s stock price as well as increases in the value of assets directly tied to deferred compensation plans totaling million  the remaining costs of compensation associated with the new capital markets business acquisition million  and short term guaranteed compensation to new employees while down substantially from the prior year as the company significantly expanded its professional work force across all areas of its business during as previously reported  the company is not involved in the sub prime mortgage business  and does not have any exposure to that business as a result of its recent acquisition or otherwise 
for a number of years  the company has offered auction rate securities ars to its clients 
a significant portion of the market in ars has failed because  in the tight credit market  the dealers are no longer willing or able to purchase the imbalance between supply and demand for ars 
these securities have auctions scheduled on either a  or day cycle 
clients of the company own a significant amount of ars in their individual accounts 
the absence of a liquid market for these securities presents a significant problem to clients and  as a result  to the company 
it should be noted that this is a failure of liquidity and not a default 
these securities in almost all cases have not failed to pay interest or principal when due 
these securities are fully collateralized for the most part and  for the most part  remain good credits 
the company has not acted a s an auction agent for ars nor does it have a significant exposure in its proprietary accounts 
recently  some of these ars have been redeemed at par of issue value plus accrued dividends by their issuers thus reducing the scope of the issue for clients and the company 
however  in excess of fifty percent of the overall ars issued into the ars market remain outstanding 
there is no way to predict the pace of future redemptions or whether all of these securities will be redeemed by their issuers 
there has been pressure by regulators for financial services firms to redeem ars held by clients 
settlements with regulators by our competitors have created inconsistencies in the treatment between firms that have fully redeemed ars from clients with their own funds and firms  like the company  which have yet to do so 
the company continues to review this situation and explore options to help bring liquidity to the company s clients holding ars 
the company has reviewed various programs initiated by the us government to restore liquidity to the markets 
the company considered filing an amendment to the charter of oppenheimer trust company to become a depository bank eligible for fdic insurance as well as to obtain access to the us federal reserve discount window  filing an application with the fdic for oppenheimer trust company to obtain deposit insurance  and filing applications on behalf of oppenheimer trust company and oppenheimer holdings to participate in the us treasury capital purchase program 
this plan was discontinued as it failed to provide a meaningful solution to the ars problem 
in addition  the company has considered and rejected applying to become a bank holding company for the same reason 
the compan y moved the situs of the company to the united states in order to  among other things  potentially avail itself of various programs sponsored by the us treasury and the fdic which may be available only to us based companies 
the company undertook and continues to undertake a program to become a primary dealer appointed by the federal reserve bank of new york 
one of the purposes of this undertaking was to access the primary dealer credit facility which might have provided a pool of liquidity with which to permit the company to undertake a meaningful program to satisfy issues surrounding ars 
the federal reserve board recently announced the closure of this facility beginning february  the company continues to pursue alternatives  which might under certain circumstances  provide the liquidity necessary to permit the company to redeem ars from its clients 
see risk factors the company may be adversely affected by the failure of the auction rate securities market and factors affecting forward looking statements 
the company is focused on growing its private client and asset management businesses through strategic additions of experienced financial advisors in its existing branch system and employment of experienced money management personnel in its asset management business 
in addition  the company is committed to the improvement of its technology capability to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities while addressing the issue of managing its expenses to better align them with the current investment environment 
regulatory environment the brokerage business is subject to regulation by  among others  the sec and finra formerly the nyse and nasd in the united states  the financial services authority fsa in the united kingdom  the securities and futures commission in hong kong  the israeli securities authority isa in israel and various state securities regulators 
events in recent years surrounding corporate accounting and other activities leading to investor losses resulted in the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and have caused increased regulation of public companies 
new regulations and new interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations are creating increased costs of compliance and increased investment in systems and procedures to comply with these more complex and onerous requirements 
increasingly  the various states are imposing their own regulations that make the uniformity of regulation a thin g of the past  and make compliance more difficult and more expensive to monitor 
finra has recently completed the unification and codification of its legacy nyse and nasd rules 
recent events connected to the worldwide credit crisis have made it highly likely that the self regulatory framework for financial institutions will be changed in the united states and around the world 
the changes are likely to significantly reduce leverage available to financial institutions and to increase transparency to regulators and investors of risks taken by such institutions 
it is impossible to presently predict the nature of such rulemaking  although proposals being considered in the us and the united kingdom would possibly create a new regulator for certain activities  regulate and or prohibit proprietary trading for certain deposit taking institutions  control the amount and timing of compensation to highly paid employees  create new regulations around financial transactions with consumers  and possibly create a tax on securities transactions 
if and when en acted  such regulations will likely increase compliance costs and reduce returns earned by financial service providers 
any such action could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of the rules and requirements that were created by the passage of the patriot act  and the anti money laundering regulations aml in the us and similar laws in other countries that are related thereto have created significant costs of compliance and can be expected to continue to do so 
pursuant to finra rule formerly nasd rule and nyse rule  the chief executive officers ceos of regulated broker dealers including the ceo of oppenheimer are required to certify that their companies have processes in place to establish and test policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with federal securities laws and regulations  including applicable regulations of self regulatory organizations 
the ceo of the company is required to make such a certification on an annual basis and did so in march  other regulatory matters oppenheimer has been responding to the sec  finra and several state regulators as part of an industry wide review of the marketing and sale of ars 
the company has answered several document requests and subpoenas and there have been on the record interviews of company personnel 
during the week ended february   oppenheimer finalized settlements with each of the nyag and the msd concluding investigations and administrative proceedings by the regulators concerning oppenheimer s marketing and sale of ars 
as a result  the company will purchase eligible ars from eligible clients pursuant to those settlements 
based on the terms of the settlements  the company will make an initial national offer to purchase to eligible clients who currently hold accounts at oppenheimer no later than may  eligible clients accounts will be aggregated on a household basis 
the company will make subsequent offers to eligible clients holding eligible ars based on its availability of funds for such purpose  the amount of which the company believes  pursuant to the terms of the settlements  will not create a condition that would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
as a result  it is unlikely that the company will be required over any short period of time to purchase all of the ars currently held by the company s former or current clients who purchased ars prior to the beginning of the market s failure in february the company will continue to assess whether it has sufficient regulatory capital or borrowing capacity to make any purchases of ars beyond those agreed upon in the settlements described above 
the company estimates that it is obligated to purchase up to approximately million of eligible ars in the initial month period covered by settlements with the regulators 
such purchases will be paid for from available funds 
nbsp  the company is continuing to cooperate with investigating entities from other states 
notwithstanding the foregoing settlements  the company remains as a named respondent in a number of arbitrations by its current or former clients as well as lawsuits  including a class action lawsuit  related to its sale of ars 
see risk factors the company may be adversely affected by the failure of the auction rate securities market  appearing in item a  and legal proceedings  appearing in item other matters a subsidiary of the company was the administrative agent for two closed end funds until december  the company has been advised by the current administrative agent for these two funds that the internal revenue service may file a claim for interest and penalties for one of these funds with respect to the tax year as a result of an alleged failure of such subsidiary to take certain actions 
the company will continue to monitor developments in this matter 
the company operates in all state jurisdictions in the united states and is thus subject to regulation and enforcement under the laws and regulations of each of these jurisdictions 
the company has been and expects that it will continue to be subject to investigations and some or all of these may result in enforcement proceedings as a result of its business conducted in the various states 
as part of its ongoing business  the company records reserves for legal expenses  judgments  fines and or awards attributable to litigation and regulatory matters 
in connection therewith  the company has maintained its legal reserves at levels it believes will resolve outstanding matters  but may increase or decrease such reserves as matters warrant 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the company establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable 
when loss contingencies are not both probable and estimable  the company does not establish reserves 
in some of the matters described above  including but not limited to the u 
s airways matter  loss contingencies are not probable and estimable in the view of management and  accordingly  reserves have not been established for those matters 
business continuity the company is committed to an on going investment in its technology and communications infrastructure including extensive business continuity planning and investment 
these costs are on going and the company believes that current and future costs will exceed historic levels due to business and regulatory requirements 
this investment has increased over and as a result of the acquisition of the new capital markets businesses from cibc and the company s need to build out its platform to accommodate this business 
the company successfully transitioned these businesses to its platform in the third quarter of outlook the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker dealers or the opening of new branch offices in attractive locations  thus maximizing the potential of each office and the development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates 
as opportunities are presented  it is the long term intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel at a price that would provide the company s stockholders with incremental value 
the company acquired on january   the new capital markets business described under item  business 
the company may review additional potential acquisition opportunities  and will continue to focus its attention on the management of its existing business 
in addition  the company is committed to improving its technology capabilities to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities

the market environment that developed in in the wake of the failure of financial institutions and seizures in the credit markets resulted in declining markets around the world and higher levels of risk  conditions that began to improve in the company satisfies its need for short term funds from internally generated funds and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings  consisting primarily of bank loans  stock loans and uncommitted lines of credit 
the company s longer term capital needs are met through the issuance of the senior secured credit note and the subordinated note 
the amount of oppenheimer s bank borrowings fluctuates in response to changes in the level of the company s securities inventories and customer margin debt  changes in stock loan balances and changes in notes receivable from employees

at december   the company had no such borrowings outstanding compared to outstanding borrowings of million at december  at december   the company had available collateralized and uncollateralized letters of credit of million 
the unprecedented volatility of the financial markets  accompanied by a severe deterioration of economic conditions worldwide  has had a pronounced adverse affect on the availability of credit through traditional sources 
as a result of concern about the ability of markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically  many lenders have reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to the company on both a secured and unsecured basis

it will make subsequent offers to eligible clients holding eligible ars based on the company s availability of funds for such purpose  the amount of which the company believes  pursuant to the terms of the settlements  will not create a condition that would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
as a result  it is unlikely that the company w ill be required over any short period of time to purchase all of the ars currently held by the company s former or current clients who purchased ars prior to the beginning of the market s failure in february the company will continue to assess whether it has sufficient regulatory capital or borrowing capacity to make any purchases of ars beyond those agreed upon in the settlements described above

see item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds and short term fixed income securities and loans issued by various corporations 
market risk 
market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
oppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports 
each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts 
positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis 
in its market making activities  oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets 
as a result of this  oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place  which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute to minute basis 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the company fails to perform its contractual obligations 
given the problems in the credit markets that occurred in  there has been an increased focus in the industry about credit risk 
the company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral wherever possible 
the company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
when oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction  it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances 
if the market price of the securities purchased or loaned has declined or increased  respectively  oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced 
a similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped 
in addition  oppenheimer s securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity 
in addition to monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers  oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the nyse 
generally  oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than of the value of the securities or if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues 
particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the nasdaq market 
in comparison  the nyse permits loans of up to of the value of the equity securities in a customer s account 
further discussion of credit risk appears in note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in item operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in its operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and it is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance policies and procedures including the maintenance of disaster recovery faci lities and procedures related thereto that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled

for details of funding risk  see item under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
legal and regulatory risk 
legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  client claims and the possibility of sizeable adverse legal judgments 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly intense over the past few years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
timely and accurate compliance with regulatory requests has become increasingly problematic  and regulators have tended to bring enforcement proceedings in relation to such matters 
see further discussion of these risks in item under the caption regulatory environment 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
the company has designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations under the us patriot act 
see further discussion of the company s reserve policy in item  under the captions critical accounting estimates  item  legal proceedings and item  regulation 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in certain limited instances  the company utilizes off balance sheet arrangements to manage risk 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in item value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the sec s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading of financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of dollars var for fiscal var for fiscal high low average high low average equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total var at december  equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december  the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately million million in in corporate equities  which are related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
the company used derivative financial instruments to hedge market risk in fiscal and  including in connection with the senior secured credit note  which is described in note of the notes to th e consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appearing in item such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item a  risk factors 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions  including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
