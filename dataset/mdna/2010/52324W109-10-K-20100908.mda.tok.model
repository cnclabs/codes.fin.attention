item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
fiscal year our fiscal years end on the saturday closest to june  resulting in an extra week of results every five or six years 
fiscal is a week year  while fiscal and represent week years 
overview we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research 
in we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we are a leading  worldwide provider of oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers as well as a provider of related test and measurement equipment and currently operate as one business segment in the test and measurement industry 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer seven families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions waveexpert  a powerful family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules  wavemaster  one of our high performance product families  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  wavesurfer  designed for users in the low bandwidth sector of the market  wavejet  designed for value oriented users in the low bandwidth sector of the market  and waveace  our entry level oscilloscope products 
our protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces  including usb  usb  bluetooth  pci express  serial ata  serial attached scsi sas and others 
we sell our products into a broad range of industry sectors  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace 
we believe that our products offer a strong value proposition in these sectors by providing advanced analysis capabilities coupled with innovative and proprietary technology features 
we believe designers in all of these sectors are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
we employ a direct sales model utilizing a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in certain geographic areas 
we divide the world into three areas the americas  europe middle east and asia pacific 
in the americas  we primarily sell our products directly in the united states 
in europe middle east  we sell our products directly in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
in asia pacific  we sell our products directly in south korea  singapore  japan and china 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement industry  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china 
table of contents where our sales are principally denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in south korea  we transact business in korean won and in singapore  we transact business in both us dollars and singapore dollars 
historically  we have  at times  experienced lower levels of demand during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  have been principally due to the lower level of general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of revenues represents manufacturing and service costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues 
additional factors integral to gross profit earned on our products are mix  as the list prices of our products range from to  and the effects of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which is denominated in local currencies while product manufacturing costs are primarily us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation  and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel as well as legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation  and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
our results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors 
as discussed below  we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology industry sectors into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new industry sectors and broaden our presence in existing sectors 
our sales are largely dependent on the health and growth of technology companies whose operations tend to be cyclical 
consequently  demand for our products tends to coincide with the increase or decrease in capital spending in the computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace industries 
in addition  in response to fluctuations in the technology sectors we target  we continually assess and adopt programs aimed at positioning us for long term success 
these programs may include streamlining operations  discontinuing older and less profitable product lines  changing our future product strategy  and reducing operating expenses when necessary 
we face significant competition in our target industry sectors 
we believe that in order to continue to compete successfully  we need to anticipate  recognize and respond to changing market demands by providing products that serve our customers needs as they arise at acceptable prices 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competition in each of these areas 
consequently  we are constantly reviewing our product development strategy and invest time  resources and capital in development projects we deem most likely to succeed 
we transformed our entire oscilloscope product lines by introducing a brand new line of waveaces in the economy segment and a new line of wavepros and wavemasters on the high end 
we also refreshed our mid range product lines by introducing updated versions of waverunners  wavesurfers and wavejet product lines 
we believe that our diversified product mix  along with continued enhancements  strategically positions us to expand our presence in oscilloscopes in addition to the improving economic cycle 
there are also emerging opportunities for the protocol analyzers for which we have deployed next generation standards 

table of contents our business risks our results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors 
we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology industry sectors into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new industry sectors and broaden our presence in existing sectors

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  reserves on accounts receivable  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  uncertain tax positions  valuation of deferred tax assets  the effective income tax rate and geographical distribution of taxable income  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  estimation of warranty liabilities  share based compensation expense and separation of convertible notes between debt and equity 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenues from products are included in revenues from test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations  net of any applicable sales or value added taxes 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  or when services have been provided 
the price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
currently  we recognize revenue on the sale of our protocol analyzer products  due to their significant software content  in accordance with specific revenue recognition guidance  upon shipment provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time sales of related products are recognized as revenue 
revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition 
these amendments are effective at the beginning of our fiscal year and they modify the criteria for revenue recognition in multiple arrangements and what constitutes a non software deliverable  as referenced below under recent accounting pronouncements 
in an effort to provide end user customers an alternative to purchasing the company s higher end products under its standard terms and conditions  the company offers customers an opportunity to enter into sales type or direct financing leases for these products 
in order to qualify as a sales type or direct financing lease  the lease must meet one of the same criteria used for lessees to classify a lease as a capital lease  in addition to two criteria dealing with future uncertainties 
leases not meeting the criteria are considered operating leases and are accounted for like rental property 
we classify the transactions as sales type  direct financing leases or operating leases based on review for transfers of ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term  review of the lease terms to determine if it contains an option to purchase the leased property for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property at the date of the option  review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment and review of the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
additionally  we consider the cancelability of the contract and any related uncertainty of collections or risk in recoverability of the lease investment at lease inception 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
revenues from equipment rentals under operating leases are recognized as earned over the lease term on a straight line basis 
lease and rental revenues are reported within test and measurement product revenue 
reserves on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for anticipated returns and doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
see note to the consolidated financial statements inventories  net for additional information 
uncertain tax positions 
the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
beginning on july   we have applied a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more 
table of contents likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained 
currently  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within twelve months of the reporting date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional information 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  including liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the company is required to recognize a valuation allowance for all or a portion of its deferred tax assets if it believes that it is not more likely than not  given the weight of all available evidence  that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
management assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results 
the company assessed both its positive and negative evidence to determine the proper amount of its required valuation allowance 
factors considered include the company s current and cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions and management s projection that the company expects to utilize its domestic net operating loss carryforwards well prior to the initial expiration in fiscal in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  the company s experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
the company s analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that the company has incurred a cumulative loss for its domestic operations over the recent years  which was principally due to a non recurring goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  acquisition and business realignment charges and non cash amortization of the convertible notes 
the company believes it will be able to realize all of its domestic deferred tax assets  net of the million valuation allowance 
consideration has also been given to the period over which these net deferred tax assets can be realized  and the company s history of not having federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused 
in addition  the company has considered tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible that will be implemented in a timely manner  if necessary  which will allow the company to recognize the future tax attributes by increasing taxable income in the united states 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and million existed as of july  and june   respectively  for certain tax credit carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
during the years ended july  and june   the valuation allowance increased by less than million and approximately million  respectively 
the increases were mainly due to increases in foreign net operating loss carryforwards and uncertainty surrounding the utilization of such carryforwards 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the company s net deductible temporary differences  net of the valuation allowance 
the factors that management considered in assessing the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets included  the forecast of future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
management will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted operating results 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to the company s financial position  and results of operations 

table of contents at july   the company s net us domestic deferred tax assets amounted to approximately million 
management has considered the realizability of the deferred tax assets and has concluded that a domestic valuation allowance of approximately million should be recorded  mainly related to certain tax credit carryforwards that are not anticipated to be realized 
although management determined that a valuation allowance was not required with respect to the remaining net us domestic deferred tax assets  realization of these assets is primarily dependent on achieving the forecast of future taxable income  as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
at july   the company requires approximately million in cumulative domestic future operating income to be generated at various times in the future to realize the domestic net deferred tax assets 
based upon projections  the domestic net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards would be fully utilized before the expiration 
see note to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional information 
income tax rate and geographical distribution of taxable income 
we calculate income tax expense or benefit based upon an annual estimated effective tax rate that includes estimates and assumptions that may change 
the differences between the annual estimated effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional information 
valuation of long lived asset and goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill is to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might be impaired 
in fiscal  the company changed its annual impairment testing date from fiscal year end to the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level 
the company has one reporting unit  in the test and measurement business  because none of the components of the company constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which company management regularly reviews the results of operations 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires management to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such an event may occur if  for an extended period of time  the market value of the company s common stock plus a control premium were less than the carrying value of the company 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary  and the amount of the impairment charge  involves significant judgment around the assumptions used to determine the impairment charge 
as a result of the decline in our stock price  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in fiscal  resulting in a carrying value as of june  of zero 
warranty liabilities 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability and for certain new products  third party published expected failure rates 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims  review estimates of costs to repair and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve  which may be material to our results of operations when made see note to the consolidated financial statements warranties and guarantees for additional information 

table of contents share based compensation expense 
we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights settled in cash 
the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant  while the fair value for stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period  since they are liability classified 
determining the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility and expected term of the option 
management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding forfeiture rates 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods 
further  fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
see note to the consolidated financial statements share based compensation for additional information 
convertible notes allocation between debt and equity 
on june   we adopted new accounting guidance which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components of such convertible notes in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
prior to adoption  the liability of the convertible notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in our financial statements 
because the new guidance requires retrospective application  lecroy was required to adjust all periods for which the convertible notes were outstanding prior to the date of adoption 
upon adoption and effective as of the issuance date of the convertible notes  lecroy recorded approximately million of the principal amount to equity  representing a debt discount for the difference between lecroy s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of at the time and the coupon rate of the convertible notes 
this debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the notes using the effective interest method 
upon convertible note repurchase  the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to extinguishment was measured first and the difference between the fair value of the aggregate consideration paid and the fair value of the liability component was attributed to the reacquisition of the equity component

in fiscal  positive foreign currency fluctuations impacted revenue by approximately million and an additional week of sales was included due to the rd week 
our year to date sales were impacted by our customers reducing staff levels and therefore their need for capital equipment  as well as postponing and reducing spending  a trend that began to reverse itself in the second half of the fiscal year 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenues and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues were approximately million for the year ended july   representing an increase of or approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of revenue earned from a research and development arrangement in the amount of million  along with positive foreign currency impact  slightly offset by a decline in customer upgrade purchases attributable to the economic downturn 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows dollars in thousands july  weeks july  percentage june  weeks june  percentage americas europe middle east asia pacific total revenues 
table of contents for the year end july   revenues were higher in terms of dollars and percentages in the americas due to strong sales of our high bandwidth oscilloscopes 
revenues were lower in terms of dollars in europe middle east and asia pacific  due to the worldwide economic downturn and timing of shipments  despite positive foreign currency impact 
the losses in these geographic locations more than offset the gains in the americas 
gross profit for the year ended july  was approximately million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the gross margin in fiscal was positively impacted by revenue earned from a research and development arrangement in the amount of million which was entered into in the first quarter of the fiscal year  slightly offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million 
share based compensation expense was approximately million and million for the year ended july  and june   respectively 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by a decreased demand for our test and measurement products  and greater discounting practices necessary to drive sales in an economic downturn  partially offset by increased sales of our higher end products which slightly improved margins 
also contributing to the lower gross margins in fiscal was million of costs associated with an inventory write down  as a result of a change in our product strategy due to deteriorating market conditions and approximately million in severance costs  as a result of our realignment initiatives 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  representing a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal  along with a decrease in business realignment and restructuring charges of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million  as a result of the increase in fair value of the stock appreciation rights sars  an additional week of compensation expense and other expenses  as the current fiscal year period represented a week period versus a week period in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development r d expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal  along with no business realignment charges in fiscal as compared to approximately million of charges in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million and an additional week of compensation expense and other expenses in fiscal versus fiscal as a percentage of revenue  r d expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal other expense income  net  which consists primarily of gains on the extinguishment of our convertible debt  net of issue cost write off  interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and amortization of debt discount on convertible notes was an expense of approximately million in fiscal compared to income of approximately million in fiscal net interest expense was approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million for the comparable prior period 
in addition  there was a net loss of approximately million for fiscal as compared to a net gain of approximately million in the prior fiscal year  resulting from the changes in our foreign exchange forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than our functional currencies 
fiscal also included a gain on the extinguishment of convertible debt  net of issue cost write off of approximately million  as we repurchased million of principal of our outstanding convertible notes in fiscal as compared to a net gain of approximately million when we repurchased million of principal of our notes during the prior fiscal year 
due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to our convertible notes  we recorded approximately million of non cash amortization expense on a year to date basis in fiscal as compared to approximately million of non cash amortization expense in prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due to the impact of convertible note repurchases more than offsetting the accretion of the debt discount 
see note to the consolidated financial statements debt and capital leases for additional information 

table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is significantly higher due to the relatively low pre tax income and the higher proportional impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and state income taxes  as well as the write off of a tax credit 
in addition  the fiscal tax rate includes a decrease in tax expense of approximately million from the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  offset by an increase in tax expense of approximately million for the write down of the deferred tax asset related to equity based compensation that resulted in a shortfall of cumulative tax benefits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes a reduction of the tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of goodwill that is not amortizable for tax purposes  an increase in the tax benefit of approximately million resulting from the true up of the prior year s tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns related to research and development tax credits  an increase in the tax benefit of approximately million from the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and a reduction of the tax benefit of approximately million for the write down of the deferred tax asset related to restricted stock grants that resulted in a shortfall of cumulative tax benefits 
the company calculates income tax expense benefit based upon an annual estimated effective tax rate that includes estimates and assumptions that may change 
the differences between the annual estimated effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   compared to approximately million in the prior year  representing a decrease of  or approximately million  primarily as a result of a measurable decline in sales of test and measurement products driven by the worldwide economic downturn  as well as negative foreign currency impact 
foreign currency fluctuations decreased total revenues by approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal our sales were impacted by our customers reducing staffing levels and therefore their need for capital equipment  as well as postponing spending  mostly for our mid range oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers 
service and other revenues primarily consist of service revenues and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   representing a decrease of or approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in upgrade purchases furthered by the economic downturn  as customers delayed or cancelled servicing of their products  as well as negative foreign currency impact 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows dollars in thousands june  june  percentage june  june  percentage americas europe middle east asia pacific total revenues for the year end june   the geographic revenues in terms of dollars were lower in all regions due to the worldwide economic downturn and negative foreign currency impact 
gross profit for the year ended june  was approximately million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased demand for our test and measurement products  and greater discounting practices necessary to drive sales in an economic downturn  partially offset by increased sales of our higher end products which slightly improved margins 
also contributing to the lower gross margins in fiscal 
table of contents was million of costs associated with an inventory write down  as a result of a change in our product strategy due to deteriorating market conditions and approximately million in severance costs  as a result of our realignment initiatives 
the gross margin in fiscal included approximately million for inventory write downs 
absent these charges in both years  fiscal margins as a percentage of sales were  as compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  representing a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal which included reductions in workforce  compensation and other employee benefits 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our share based compensation expense of approximately million  as a result of the reduction in fair value of the stock appreciation rights sars 
these cost reductions more than offset approximately million of business realignment and restructuring costs in the current year for severance and lease charges 
in fiscal  the catalyst trade name failed the intangible asset impairment test due to a change in our product strategy  and accordingly we took a non cash charge of approximately million 
additionally  there was approximately million of business realignment charges in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower sales base 
research and development r d expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to our extensive cost reduction program that began in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by approximately million of business realignment charges 
as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower sales base in fiscal impairment of goodwill was approximately million in fiscal  representing the write off of our goodwill balance associated with our catalyst and catc acquisitions

the company calculates income tax expense benefit based upon an annual estimated effective tax rate that includes estimates and assumptions that may change 
the differences between the annual estimated effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  and political instability 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as third party vendor payments  revenues and intercompany payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows  we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to decrease the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future resulting in mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal   and  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on both forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than the subsidiaries functional currencies was a net loss of approximately million  a net gain of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million  respectively 
these net gains and losses are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
at july  and june   the notional amounts of the company s open foreign exchange forward contracts  all with maturities of less than six months  were approximately million and million  respectively  with a net unrealized loss of approximately million and a net unrealized gain of approximately million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and fair value for additional information 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at july   assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on our open foreign exchange forward contracts and our assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have no material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows from operations 
on october   we completed the sale of million of convertible senior notes the notes due october  the notes will pay interest semiannually through maturity and will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
during fiscal and  we repurchased approximately million and million of principal  respectively  of the outstanding convertible notes  resulting in a balance of approximately million and million at july  and june   respectively 
as of july  and june   the market value of the convertible notes was approximately million and million  respectively 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents  as well as  our million credit facility 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would have been an incremental charge of approximately million  after tax  to our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in fiscal in addition  the company s liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates
