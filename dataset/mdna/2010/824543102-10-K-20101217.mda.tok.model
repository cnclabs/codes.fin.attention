item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands general shiloh is a supplier of numerous parts to both automobile oems and  as a tier ii supplier  to tier i automotive part manufacturers who in turn supply oems 
the parts that the company produces supply many models of vehicles manufactured by nearly all vehicle manufacturers that produce vehicles in north america 
as a result  the company s revenues are very dependent upon the north american production of automobiles and light trucks  particularly production by traditional domestic manufacturers  such as general motors  chrysler and ford 
according to industry statistics  traditional domestic manufacturer production in fiscal increased by and total north american car and light truck production for the fiscal increased by  in each case compared with production of fiscal the continued viability of the traditional domestic manufacturers is critical to the profitability of the company 
as of october   of the company s receivables outstanding are due from general motors  chrysler  and ford 
another significant factor affecting the company s revenues is the company s ability to successfully bid on the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the company s customers 
these new model introductions typically go through a start of production phase with build levels that are higher than normal because the consumer supply network is filled to ensure adequate supply to the market  resulting in an increase in the company s revenues at the beginning of the cycle 
plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
for fiscal  the company s facilities operated at approximately capacity and operated at an increased rate of in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  plant utilization was at 
the company defines capacity as working hours per day and five days per week 
utilization of capacity is dependent upon the releases against customer purchase orders that are used to establish production schedules and manpower and equipment requirements for each month and quarterly period of the fiscal year 
the significant majority of the steel purchased by the company s stamping and engineered welded blank operations is purchased through the customers steel programs 
under these programs  the company pays the steel suppliers and passes on to the customers the steel price the customers negotiated with the steel suppliers 
although the company takes ownership of the steel  the customers are responsible for all steel price fluctuations 
the company also purchases steel directly from domestic primary steel producers and steel service centers 
domestic steel pricing has varied widely during the last fiscal year 
the company also blanks and processes steel for some of its customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
toll processing operations result in lower revenues but higher gross margins than operations where the company takes ownership of the steel 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of the company s processing operations  and net proceeds from the disposition of scrap steel contribute to gross margin by offsetting the increases in the cost of steel and the attendant costs of quality and availability 
changes in the price of steel impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 

table of contents company s response to economic conditions affecting the automotive industry the production of cars and light trucks for fiscal in north america according to industry statistics was  units 
the production units for fiscal compares to  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal year and  in fiscal production in fiscal was affected by low consumer demand  the inability to finance vehicle leases and purchases  and higher unemployment levels  among other factors affecting the economy at that time 
these same factors are affecting the automotive industry globally as well as domestically 
in response to the low production volume of fiscal  the company initiated several action plans which were continued throughout fiscal these included challenging customer releases 
the company s production scheduling is based on releases that are received weekly for thirteen week periods 
the releases drive manning levels and inventory purchases 
the company s operations personnel review the releases each week to ensure that the releases are not overly optimistic  a problem that seems to impact tier i customers and not oem manufacturing plants 
inventory orders 
the company s operations personnel monitor daily the ordering and receipt of production material to ensure that inventory will be readily consumed in the manufacturing process and that cash outlays for purchases coincide with receipts for sale of parts to the company s customers 
manning levels 
the company s operations personnel also monitor daily the level of personnel required to fulfill the production schedule by operating the equipment that produces the parts direct personnel and to support the direct personnel efforts indirect  technical  and administrative staff 
manning is adjusted daily to react as necessary 
discretionary spending in support of operations 
the company s operating personnel also monitor the spending required for repair and maintenance  purchases of supplies consumed in operating production equipment and indirect support of operations  such as material handling equipment and utilities 
these daily activities were factored into forecasts for each plant for the balance of the fiscal year 
the plant forecasts were consolidated to provide forecasts of operating results on a weekly and monthly basis  updated weekly to reflect the latest developments in terms of customer intelligence and new awards of business 
this process was intended to address the cash needs of the company considering capital asset and tooling needs related to new business as well as ongoing cash requirements for operations  payroll  pension contributions  debt repayment requirements  contingencies and other matters 
all of the above actions were intended to ensure that controllable variable spending is in line with the forecast of sales as indicated by the customer releases against open purchase orders 
actions were also initiated to monitor selling  general and administrative costs as well 
the company also assessed the level of working capital risk with each customer by monitoring accounts receivable and payable levels to ensure that net balances are either equal or in favor of the company 
the company also reviews compliance of the company s customers with terms and conditions of their purchase orders and gathers market intelligence on the customers to consider in assessing any risk in the collection process 
with the conclusion of fiscal  the company continues to exercise caution as the next fiscal year has begun 
the same disciplined approach that was followed in fiscal and remains in place 
according to industry forecasts  car and light truck production is predicted to increase to  units  a level that represents a improvement over fiscal s production but still below the average production levels of the preceding five years 
the company s approach to monitoring customer release volumes and the adjustment of the company s cost structure  as described above  remains appropriate to aid the company in controlling operating costs and maintaining or improving profitability 
the company therefore intends to adjust manning levels and discretionary spending in support of operations as necessary in relation to customer releases as the releases are updated 

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the items that follow as critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
these estimates were selected because of inherent imprecision that may result from applying judgment to the estimation process 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to these policies are initially based on the company s best estimates at the time they are recorded 
adjustments are charged or credited to income and the related balance sheet account when actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
the company makes frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood that material adjustments will be required 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue both for sales from toll processing and sales of products made with company owned steel when there is evidence of a sales agreement  the delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of revenue is reasonably assured 
the company records revenues upon shipment of product to customers and transfer of title under standard commercial terms 
price adjustments  including those arising from resolution of quality issues  price and quantity discrepancies  surcharges for fuel and or steel and other commercial issues are recognized in the period when management believes that such amounts become probable  based on management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on several factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and the current financial condition of customers 
the financial condition of the company s customers is dependent on  among other things  the general economic environment  which may substantially change  thereby affecting the recoverability of amounts due to the company from its customers 
the company carefully assesses its risk with each of its customers and considering compliance with terms and conditions  aging of the customer accounts  intelligence learned through contact with customer representatives and net account receivable account payable position with customers  if applicable 
inventory reserves 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are used to determine cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns  and in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
the company values inventories on a regular basis to identify inventories on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  the company provides a reserve for the full value of the inventory  net of estimated realizable value 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates future demand 
additional inventory reserves may be required if actual market conditions differ from management s expectations 
in view of the current economic conditions affecting the automotive industry  the company is carefully monitoring purchases of inventory to insure that receipts coincide with shipments  thereby reducing the economic risk of holding excessive levels of inventory that could result in long holding periods or in unsalable inventory leading to losses in conversion 

table of contents income taxes 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and international income taxes minus tax credits and other incentives that will reduce tax expense in the year they are claimed 
deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence typically assessed includes the operating results for the most recent three year period and  to a lesser extent because of inherent uncertainty  the expectations of future profitability  available tax planning strategies  the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse and taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the tax law 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on the company s estimate of whether  and the extent to which  the payment of additional taxes will be required 
the company reports interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company has historically performed an annual impairment analysis of long lived assets  which only includes property  plant and equipment since the company has no intangible assets 
however  when significant events  which meet the definition of a triggering event in the context of assessing asset impairments  occur within the industry or within the company s primary customer base  such as at april  when general motors and chrysler were experiencing severe financial difficulties  an interim impairment analysis is performed 
the analysis consists of reviewing the next five years outlook for sales  profitability  and cash flow for each of the company s manufacturing plants and for the overall company 
the five year outlook considers known sales opportunities for which purchase orders exist  potential sale opportunities that are under development  third party forecasts of north american car builds published by csm worldwide  and the potential sales that could result from new manufacturing process additions and lastly  strategic geographic localities that are important to servicing the automotive industry 
all of this data is collected as part of our annual planning process and is updated with more current company specific and industry data when an interim period impairment analysis is deemed necessary  as was the case at april  in concluding the impairment analysis  the company incorporates a sensitivity analysis by probability weighting the achievement of the forecasted cash flows by plant and achievements of cash flows that are greater and less than the forecasted amounts 
the property  plant and equipment included in the analysis for each plant represents factory facilities devoted to the company s manufacturing processes and the related equipment within each plant needed to perform and support those processes 
the property  plant and equipment of each plant form each plant s asset group and typically certain key assets in the group form the primary process at that plant that generate revenue and cash flow for that facility 
certain key assets have a life of ten to twelve years and the remainder of the assets in the asset group are shorter lived assets that support the key processes 
when the analysis indicates that estimated future undiscounted cash flows of a plant are less than the net carrying value of the longed lived assets of such plant  to the extent that the assets cannot be redeployed to another plant to generate positive cash flow  the company will record an impairment charge  reducing the net carrying value of the fixed assets exclusive of land and buildings  the fair value of which would be assessed through appraisals to zero 
alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset group are typically not considered due to the limited use nature of the equipment and the full utilization of their useful life 
therefore  the equipment is of limited value in a used equipment market 
the depreciable lives of the company s fixed assets are generally consistent between years unless the assets are devoted to the manufacture of a customized automotive part and the equipment has limited reapplication opportunities 
if the production of that part concludes earlier than expected  the asset life is shortened to totally amortize its remaining value over the shortened production period 

table of contents the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s business 
based on then current facts  the company recorded a net impairment charge of  related to long lived assets in the second quarter of fiscal and a charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recorded in fiscal and the company continues to assess impairment to long lived assets based on expected orders from the company s customers and current business conditions 
the key assumptions related to the forecasted operating results could be adversely impacted by  among other things  decreases in estimated north american car builds during the forecast period  the inability of the company or its major customers to maintain their respective forecasted market share positions  the inability of the company to achieve the forecasted levels of operating margins on parts produced  and a deterioration in property values associated with manufacturing facilities 
group insurance and workers compensation accruals 
the company is self insured for group insurance and workers compensation and reviews these accruals on a monthly basis to adjust the balances as determined necessary 
the company reviews historical claims data and lag analysis as the primary indicators of the accruals 
additionally  the company reviews specific large insurance claims to determine whether there is a need for additional accrual on a case by case basis 
changes in the claim lag periods and the specific occurrences could materially impact the required accrual balance period to period 
the company carries excess insurance coverage for group insurance and workers compensation claims exceeding a range of and per plan year  respectively  dependent upon the location where the claim is incurred 
at october  and  the amount accrued for group insurance and workers compensation claims was  and  respectively 
the insurance reserves have declined between years as a result of improved safety statistics  reduced employment levels  reduced number of open and active workers compensation cases  and group insurance plan design features 
the company does not self insure for any other types of losses 
share based payments 
the company records compensation expense for the fair value of nonvested stock option awards over the remaining vesting period 
the company has elected to use the simplified method to calculate the expected term of the stock options outstanding at five to six years and has utilized historical weighted average volatility 
the company determines the volatility and risk free rate assumptions used in computing the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  in consultation with an outside third party 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used are management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  the recorded stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements 
in addition  the company has estimated a forfeiture rate 
if actual forfeitures materially differ from the estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
pension and other post retirement costs and liabilities 
the company has recorded significant pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other post retirement liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 

table of contents the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the pension and other post retirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
beginning in  the principal pension discount yield curve principal curve has replaced the citigroup pension discount curve citigroup curve as the basis for determining the discount rate for reporting pension and retiree medical liabilities 
the principal curve has several advantages to the citigroup curve  that was used in fiscal  including transparency of construction  lower statistical errors  and continuous forward rates for all years 
at october   the resulting discount rate from the use of the principal curve was  a decrease of 
from a year ago that resulted in an increase of the benefit obligation of approximately  a change of basis points in the discount rate at october  would increase or decrease expense on an annual basis by approximately the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall  whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
a change of basis points in the assumed rate of return on pension assets would increase or decrease pension assets by approximately the company s investment policy for assets of the plans is to maintain an allocation generally of to in equity securities  to in debt securities  and to in real estate 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
the company s investment advisors and actuaries review this computed rate of return 
industry comparables and other outside guidance are also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
for the twelve months ended october   the actual return on pension plans assets for all of the company s plans approximated to  which exceeded the expected rate of return on plan assets of used to derive pension expense 
the long term expected rate of return takes into account years with exceptional gains and years with exceptional losses 
actual results that differ from these estimates may result in more or less future company funding into the pension plans than is planned by management 
based on current market investment performance  the company anticipates that contributions to the company s defined benefit plans will increase in fiscal  and that pension expense will increase in fiscal as well 
results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
sales for fiscal were  an increase of  over fiscal of  or 
sales increased during fiscal as a result of increased production volumes experienced by the north american automotive and heavy truck industries for which the company supplies parts as well as sales that resulted from business awarded to the company from competitors and sales that resulted from new model introductions during fiscal according to industry statistics  traditional domestic manufacturer production for fiscal increased by and total north american car and light truck production for fiscal increased by  in each case compared with production for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was  compared to a loss of  for fiscal  an increase of  gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal compared to a negative for fiscal gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was favorably affected by the increased 
table of contents volume of sales in fiscal compared to the previous year improving gross profit by approximately  gross profit was also favorably affected by lower material costs  including improvements in revenue realized from the sale of engineered scrap during fiscal compared to fiscal the net effect was reduced material costs of approximately  these favorable factors resulting in increased gross profit were offset by increased manufacturing expenses of approximately  that were related to the increased sales volumes and level of production activity experienced in fiscal compared to fiscal personnel and personnel related expenses increased by approximately  and expenses related to repairs and maintenance and manufacturing related supplies increased by approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of fiscal sales 
for fiscal  selling general and administrative expenses were  or of fiscal sales 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses reflects increased personnel and personnel related expenses of approximately  reflecting the improved economic conditions in fiscal compared to the depressed conditions of fiscal in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were favorably affected by the reversal of a reserve of  that was initially provided in the second quarter of fiscal at that time  the reserve represented management s estimate of the probable outcome of a legal decision related to a jury verdict adverse to the company 
the company appealed the jury verdict to the sixth circuit court of appeals and in july  the court of appeals overturned the jury s verdict 
based upon the outcome of this matter  the company reversed the reserve as well as interest accrued since the reserve was established 
the reversal was credited to selling  general and administrative expenses  and interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved the company s plan to purchase a plant site in bowling green  kentucky for the manufacture of first operation precision blanks and other complementary products that are currently manufactured at the company s plant in mansfield  ohio 
the plan also includes the transfer of other mansfield business to the company s medina blanking facility in valley city  ohio 
the company will  therefore  close the operations of its mansfield blanking division during fiscal as its work is relocated to these other plants 
the company will relocate certain machinery and equipment to bowling green or valley city to support the ongoing business and to service the new business in the kentucky area 
as a result  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of  to reduce long lived assets that will not be transferred to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of machinery and equipment  as determined using level inputs  was zero as the items are worn equipment for which the company had no further use and they have limited use and limited value in the used equipment market 
the mansfield real property was reduced by  to a fair value of  based on an independent assessment by a real estate firm that considered recent sales of similar properties  tax valuation  and replacement cost value 
the company also recorded a restructuring charge of representing the curtailment of the retirement plan of mansfield blanking employees 
recovery of previously impaired assets from the sale of equipment from a former company facility of reduced the mansfield impairment charge to a net amount of  in march  management presented to the board of directors its plan to close the operations of its liverpool manufacturing division due to declining levels of sales 
the board approved the plan 
the company therefore has completed its plan to relocate certain machinery and equipment to another of the company s plants to service business that will continue and to close operations at liverpool 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce long lived assets that will not be transferred to their estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the assets was zero because  similar to mansfield  the assets were worn machinery and equipment for which the company had no further use and have a limited use and limited value in a used equipment market 
the asset impairment charge for liverpool of  was offset by the sale for cash of for equipment from the company s former cleveland stamping facility 
the net asset impairment charge was for fiscal the company also recorded a restructuring charge of based on a negotiated settlement for approximately employees for severance  health insurance  and curtailment of the retirement plan of the liverpool manufacturing employees
