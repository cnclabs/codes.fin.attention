item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco financial corporation camco or the corporation has evolved into a full service provider of financial products through its subsidiaries  advantage bank advantage or bank and camco title agency 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco has grown from million of consolidated assets in to million of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offer 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 

table of contents management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s regions has the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer and business preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent regions from its competition 
management believes that the bank regions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer and business needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s operations have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
overview during  the economic environment for financial services companies continued to be disruptive and challenging 
we continued to execute our long term strategic plan to diversify the balance sheet by strategically working to increase our commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and improve our funding mix by reducing borrowings and increasing transaction based deposits 
we have found that core deposit growth continues to be challenging 
competition for deposits continues to put pressure on marginal funding costs  despite continued lower rates in during fiscal  deposits decreased  primarily due to our decrease in public funds and brokered deposits 
the brokered deposits were not renewed in as loan balances decreased and cash was utilized to decrease higher yielding non core funding and borrowed funds 
the real estate market in the midwest continues to create a very challenging environment for most financial institutions 
bankruptcies  foreclosures and unemployment have continued to rise in ohio 
we are working diligently to manage delinquencies and work with our loan customers in order to reduce losses for them  as well as our corporation 
the total loan portfolio decreased million for the full year of as we tightened credit standards and became more selective in underwriting new loans  which coupled with the volatile market conditions and the current economic environment  reduced new loan production 
nonperforming loans decreased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of the decrease primarily occurred in non residential loans with all loan categories decreasing to some extent 
we continue to deal with the economic challenges in our markets  through our loan charge offs and provision for loan losses as we recognize the results of these current economic conditions and issues related to higher than normal unemployment 
net charge offs totaled million during and we continue to aggressively work with borrowers to mitigate additional losses 
we believe we are taking significant steps forward in managing our operational efficiency 
we are continuing our focus on improving noninterest income and controlling noninterest expense by exiting unprofitable lines of business and refining our operations 
we continue to analyze new products to deepen relationships with our customers and improve the structure of our balance sheet 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and this annual report include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act  as amended  which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  might  could  would  believe  expect  intend  plan  seek  anticipate  estimate  project or continue or the negative thereof or comparable terminology 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document regarding our outlook  financial position and results of 
table of contents operation  liquidity  capital resources and interest rate sensitivity are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to anticipated changes in industry conditions created by state and federal legislation and regulations  anticipated changes in general interest rates and the impact of future interest rate changes on our profitability  capital adequacy and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  retention of our existing customer base and our ability to attract new customers  the development of new products and services and their success in the marketplace  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and  statements regarding our anticipated loan and deposit account growth  expense levels  liquidity and capital resources and projections of earnings 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements included herein include  but are not limited to competition in the industry and markets in which we operate  levels of non performing assets  changes in general interest rates  loan demand  rapid changes in technology affecting the financial services industry  real estate values  changes in government regulation  and general economic and business conditions 
this md a is intended to give stockholders a more comprehensive review of the issues facing management than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data elsewhere in this annual report 
as used herein and except as the context may otherwise require  references to camco  the corporation  we  us  or our means  collectively  camco financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  advantage bank and camco title agency 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the 
table of contents ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect management s evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to management 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
each quarter management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors including current housing price depreciation  homeowners loss of equity  etc and historical delinquency and loss trends 
the allowance is developed through specific components  the specific allowance for loans subject to individual analysis  the allowance for classified loans not otherwise subject to individual analysis and the allowance for non classified loans including homogenous loans 
classified loans with indication or acknowledgment of deterioration in specific industries are subject to individual analysis 
loan classifications are those used by regulators consisting of special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
in evaluating these loans for impairment  the measure of expected loss is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  a loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
all other classified assets and non classified assets are combined with the homogenous loan pools and segregated into loan segments 
the segmentation is based on grouping loans with similar risk characteristics one to four family  home equity  etc loss rate factors are developed for each loan segment which are used to estimate losses and determine an allowance 
the loss factors for each segment are derived from historical loss experience 
management also considers various internal and external factors to determine additional adjustments needed such as historical delinquency  trends in classifications  etc 
the allowance is reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the bank s trends in delinquencies and loan losses  trends in delinquencies and losses for the region  nation  and economic factors 
while the corporation strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  we transmit information to a third party provider who assists us with determining the possible impairment of msrs  as described below 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each grouping of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage 
table of contents loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for float is also calculated by our third party utilizing the current period fed funds rate 
we believe this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by the third party provider utilizing industry standards in estimating prepayment speeds and provides specific scenarios with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earning figures approximate the cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  we review the information and msrs are marked to the lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter 
summary 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuation of mortgage servicing rights are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require us to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of decreases in loans receivable  securities and cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions which were offset partially by the increase in real estate acquired through foreclosure 
we expect asset growth to continue to be limited in the near term as the unemployment rates continue to rise and the economy continues to struggle 
further deterioration of the residential loan market in the midwest and fewer new purchases may result in a shift in the loan portfolio toward commercial and consumer loans 
the current loan rates may continue to contribute to additional profits relating to the sale of fixed rate loans  but due to a slowdown of new purchases it is not likely that the profits will continue to be as strong in possible future growth in deposits would most likely be used to reduce outstanding borrowings and brokered deposits or fund commercial loan growth 
we believe that the distressed economic environment is expected to continue through the first half of but we look for commercial loan growth in the latter half of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
this decrease is reflective of our decision to rely on core relationships and discontinuing purchases of brokered deposits and bidding on public funds during securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  investment security purchases totaled million  principal repayments totaling million 
the yield on securities purchased during the period was 
approximately of the securities portfolio is expected to mature or prepay during we have kept the duration and average life of the securities portfolio very short in order to provide liquidity and to reduce borrowings  when available 
at december   other than  of municipal bonds  all of our debt securities were issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises such as freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae and the fhlb 
we held no private label mortgage backed securities or collateralized debt obligations 
loans receivable net and loans held for sale totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  the decrease resulted primarily from repayments of million and loan sales of million  a million transfers to real estate owned  partially offset by loan disbursements and purchases totaling million and an increase of million of provision relating to our allowance for loan and leases 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  increased from the comparable period by million  or  while the volume of loan sales increased by million  or year to year 
the number of loans originated for sale in the secondary market continued to increase in the residential real estate market significantly as rates decreased and customers re financed at the current lower rates 
instead of selling adjustable rate loans  we have typically held adjustable rate mortgage loans for investment as an integral part of our strategy 

table of contents loan originations during the month period were comprised primarily of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million in commercial loans and million in consumer and other loans 
our intent is to expand consumer and commercial real estate lending in future periods as a means of increasing the yield on our loan portfolio and continue with our strategic plan of moving to a more bank like institution 
in the near term  however  lending volumes of acceptable risk have diminished somewhat due to a slowing economy and loan repayments have been used to reduce borrowings and maintain liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of  the yield on loans was  as the non accrual loans decreased and the portfolio mix continued to shift to higher yielding multi family  consumer and nonresidential loans 
this shift is partially offsetting lower effective rates in the loan portfolio during due to adjustable rate loans repricing in the current lower rate environment 
the overall loan portfolio decreased for the full year of as the level of charge offs increased and we continued to tighten credit standards and became more selective in underwriting new loans  which significantly reduced new loan production coupled with economic challenges in our markets  particularly in the market for residential real estate 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans three monthly payments or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
net charge offs totaled million for and were comprised mainly of family loans  non residential real estate and commercial 
the following table details delinquent and nonaccrual loans at december  and december  december  in thousands days days days delinquent  days delinquent  delinquent accruing nonaccrual delinquent accruing nonaccrual residential multifamily non residential construction development commercial heloc and second mortgage consumer and other total although we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
unemployment rates in our markets and ohio in general  are higher than the national average 
ohio registered the nation s twelfth highest state foreclosure rate in additionally  ohio is experiencing declining values of residential real estate 
however  ohio in general has not experienced significant increases in home values over the past five years like many regions in the us  which should comparatively mitigate losses on loans 
nonetheless  these factors  compounded by a very uncertain national economic outlook  may continue to increase the level of future losses beyond our current expectations 
at december   the corporation s real estate owned reo consisted of repossessed properties with a net book value of million 
initial loss is recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses within days of being transferred to reo 
thereafter  if there is a further deterioration in value  a specific valuation allowance is established and charged to operations 
the corporation reflects costs to carry reo as period costs in operations when incurred 

table of contents when property is acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is initially recorded at the fair value of the related assets at the date of foreclosure  less estimated costs to sell the property 
the corporation works with borrowers to avoid foreclosure if possible and we continue to aggressively work with borrowers to mitigate additional losses  if it becomes inevitable that a borrower will not be able to retain ownership of their property  the corporation often seeks a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to gain control of the property earlier in the recovery process 
as a result  reo grew million during the strategy of pursuing deeds in lieu of foreclosure more aggressively should result in a reduction in the holding period for nonperforming assets and ultimately reduce economic losses 
deposits totaled million at december  a decrease of million  or from december  the following table details our deposit portfolio balances and the average rate paid on our deposit portfolio at december   and december  december  december  change in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market savings certificates of deposit retail certificates of deposit brokered total deposits the decrease in certificates of deposits and money markets was primarily due to decreases in public funds and brokered deposits 
we continue to focus and implement our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by developing core relationships with small businesses  and adding commercial and retail checking accounts 
we have implemented a number of organizational and product development initiatives including a new suite of commercial and small business checking accounts  enhancements to our online business cash management system  and the launch of remote deposit capture solution 
we believe these products will help us be more competitive for business checking accounts 
see liquidity and capital resources in this md a for further discussion on our deposit strategy and additional liquidity risks 
the decrease in retail certificates of deposits is due to customers being rate sensitive and their preference toward higher yielding interest rates 
we have reduced the rates offered on some of our accounts and feel we are competitive with current markets and are planning on strategic growth of core relationships 
we also believe that if we are able to maintain the certificates of deposit maturing in the continued decreasing of rates will help to stabilize and possibly reduce our cost of funds 
to reduce interest rate risk over the long term  we will increase our efforts to lengthen the duration of our deposit structure and our fhlb borrowings 
we anticipate continuing to pay down brokered deposits in early  in order to maintain the bank s margin  by growing core deposits 
in the future  brokered deposits may be used for liquidity position and contingency funding 
however  we acknowledge that brokered deposits are not core  franchise enhancing deposits  and we do not intend to stray from our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by aggregating small business  commercial and retail checking accounts 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings decreased by million  or  to a total of million at december  we were able to reduce borrowings as a result of a net decrease in the loan portfolio of million and a decrease of million in our investment portfolios which was offset partially by decreases in cash balances of million from year to year 
the corporation continues to focus on our strategy of growing and replacing a portion of these funding sources with core relationship deposits checking  savings  money market and cd accounts in stockholders equity totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or from december  the decrease resulted primarily from a net loss of million and dividends of  
table of contents these decreases were partially offset by  decreasing interest rates that increased the fair value of our investments securities and resulted in an increase in unrealized gains on available for sale securities  net of tax  of  the bank is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to the consent order of

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net loss for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease in loss of million  or  from the million of net loss reported in the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to additional expense in of million in goodwill impairment charges  and additional impairment of million in mortgage servicing rights  and  of expenses relating to the termination of the first place financial corporation merger which was offset partially by a million increase in the provision for loan losses and a million increase in the federal taxes benefit 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest margin increased to for the twelve months ending december  compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net interest margin during the period  compared to the same period of  was due  nearly equally  to a lower volume of interest earning assets and a lower yield on those assets offset partially by lower volume of interest bearing liabilities and a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities in the period 
margin pressure has continued in due to the yield on assets continuing to decline but  we have continued with our strategies and offset the revenues by decreasing the balances of our borrowed funds 
although we feel the loan portfolio has not grown sufficiently we are currently implementing strategies to increase the volume in with continual diversification of the loan portfolio and growth in commercial and consumer loan balances as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than adjustable rate mortgages 
we also plan to continue to maintain cost of funds by banking our commercial relationships and retrieving deposits instead of borrowing at higher yields 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average yield  from in  to in  coupled with a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding year to year 
interest income on securities totaled million for the year ended december   a million  or  decrease from the period 
the decrease was due primarily to a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding  coupled with a basis point decrease in the average yield  to in interest income on fhlb stock decreased by  or  due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average yield  to in offset partially by a  increase in the average balance outstanding year to year

interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the decrease resulted primarily from a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year coupled with a basis point decrease in the average rate to in approximately million  or  of our certificate deposit portfolio will mature during while this presents an opportunity to continue reducing our cost of funds  as these deposits are re pricing in a generally lower interest rate environment we continue to experience competition for deposits in our market areas 
this competition is limiting our ability to further reduce the marginal cost of deposits to a level reflective of the general rate environment 
continued decreases in interest rates have compressed our net interest margin due to the lag in re pricing between our loan and deposit portfolios 
at the same time  the loan portfolio has not grown to offset these tighter spreads 
as noted earlier  we plan to continue to diversify the loan portfolio by encouraging growth in 
table of contents commercial and consumer loan balances 
this strategy should slow net interest margin compression as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than conventional mortgage loans and investment securities 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of the bank s loan portfolio 
key drivers of the provision are declines in commercial real estate values on existing impaired loans and loan downgrades 
the higher allocation in recent quarters primarily reflects the impact of distressed commercial real estate values and general economic conditions on specific reserves for impaired loans  while the elevated level of charge offs in the fourth quarter and resulted in higher loss factors and charge offs related to classified loans 
the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan categories is based upon camco s allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans 
the fluctuations and changes in these allocations are consistent with the changes in loan quality  loss experience and economic factors in each of the loan categories 
nonperforming loans three monthly payments or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   a decrease from million from december  additionally  net charge offs totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million  for the year ended december  based upon an analysis of these factors and the continued uncertain economic outlook  we added million to the provision for losses on loans for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in we believe our classified loans are adequately reserved for at december  however  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb losses on known classified assets or that the allowance will be adequate to cover losses on classified assets in the future  understanding that all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
in addition  the mix and composition of both portfolio loans and nonperforming loans change from period to period 
when the company sets the allowance for loan losses it is dependent on a detailed analysis of different ratios 
as of december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased from the prior year and our loan reserves also increased  representing of total net loans versus at december  we have included the following information with respect to impairment measurements relating to collateral dependent loans for better understanding of our process and procedures relating to fair value of financial instruments the percentage of impaired loans on which we relied on a current third party appraisal for valuation exceeded as of december  based on policy  a loan is typically deemed impaired nonperforming once it has gone over days delinquent 
our management of the troubled credit will vary as will the timing of valuations  loan loss provision and charge offs based on a multitude of factors such as  cash flow of the business borrower  responsiveness of the borrower  communication with the commercial banker  property inspections  property deterioration  and delinquency 
typically  a nonperforming  non homogeneous collateral dependent loan will be valued and adjusted if needed within a day period after determination of impairment 
if impaired  the collateral is then evaluated and an updated appraisal is most typically ordered 
upon receipt of an appraisal or other valuation  we complete an impairment analysis to determine if the impaired loan requires a specific reserve 
the time frame may be as short as days or as much as days  when an appraisal is ordered 
camco s credit risk management process consistently monitors key performance metrics across both the performing and non performing assets to identify any further degradation of credit quality 
additionally  impaired credits are monitored in weekly loan committee asset quality discussions  monthly asset classification committee meetings and quarterly loan loss reserve reviews 
strategy documents and exposure projections are completed on a monthly basis to ensure that the current status of the troubled asset is clearly understood and reported 
the asset classification committee oversees the management of all impaired loans and any subsequent loss provision or chargeoff that is considered 
when a loan is deemed impaired  the valuation is obtained to determine any existing loss that may be present as of the valuation date 
policy dictates that any differences from fair market value  less costs to sell  are to be recognized as loss during the current period loan 
table of contents loss provision or chargeoff 
any deviations from this policy will be identified by amount and contributing reasons for the policy departure during our quarterly reporting process 
camco s policies dictate that an impaired loan subject to partial chargeoff will remain in a nonperforming status until it is brought current 
typically  this occurs when a loan is paid current and completes a period on on time payments that demonstrate that the loan can perform 
camco monitors through various system reports any loan whose terms have been modified 
these reports identify troubled debt restructures  modification  and renewals 
when circumstances do not allow for updated collateral or camco determines that an appraisal is not needed  the underlying collateral s fair market value is estimated in the following ways camco personnel property inspections combined with original appraisal review auditor values broker price opinions various on line fair market value estimations programs ie freddie mac  fannie mae  zillow  etc 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in other income was primarily attributable to a million increase in the value of our mortgage servicing rights coupled with a  increase in gains on sales of loans

margin pressure is due to the yield on assets declining at a faster rate than the cost of funds 
at the same time  the loan portfolio has not grown sufficiently to offset the tighter spreads to result in higher net interest income 
while loan production has slowed  we continue to diversify the loan portfolio by encouraging continued growth in commercial and consumer loan balances as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than adjustable rate mortgage loans

previous decreases in the prime rate have continued to compress our net interest margin due to the lag in re pricing between our loan and deposit portfolios

table of contents the decrease in mortgage servicing rights was due to increased volatility in the market  which in turn increased the prepayment speeds utilized to value the portfolio 
at december   we serviced million of one to four family residential mortgage loans for others  primarily freddie mac and fannie mae  which declined from million at december  the decrease in rent and other income for was due to a decrease in loan prepayment penalties of  coupled with decreased income from our title insurance agency which fell  in due to the significant slowdown in home sales and related mortgage loan volume 
general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due primarily to a million impairment charge taken on goodwill coupled with the write down of real estate owned properties of million and  in merger and acquisition related charges 
core noninterest expense excluding merger and goodwill impairment charges totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or increase 
the increase in core non interest expense was primarily due to increased fdic premiums and the write down of real estate owned which were partially offset by decreases in advertising  supplies  travel and training and loan and deposit expenses 
the goodwill impairment charge is reflective of the most recent testing valuation as of september   and utilizing subsequent events through december   which indicated the fair value of the reporting unit was fully impaired as of december  the increase in fdic premiums resulted from increases in premium rates and deposit balances along with the decreased credits issuances in relating to the reorganization of the deposit insurance fund assessment of premiums by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the increase in real estate owned and other expense is reflective of falling real estate values that negatively impacted our portfolio value and caused a write down to fair market value coupled with additional properties taken in to real estate owned due to foreclosures in approximately one of every households in ohio were in foreclosure at december  additionally  as noted earlier  home values in ohio have continued to decline from previous levels 
these factors  compounded by an uncertain economic outlook and increasing unemployment  may result in continued expenses in this was coupled with additional costs relating to bank paid pmi insurance linked to a new product offering in while advertising  supplies and travel and training expenses have decreased  it is not foreseeable that they will continue to be at these lower levels due to much of the decrease was related to the announced merger with first place that was terminated november federal income taxes 
the benefit for federal income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  compared to the provision recorded in the effective tax rates amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the corporation s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the corporation to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the corporation s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 
camco is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the bank 
such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank 
ohio statutes impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions by banks 
generally  absent approval of the ohio division  such statutes limit dividend and capital distributions to earnings of the current and two preceding years 
currently  the consent order prohibits the bank from paying a dividend to camco without prior approval of the fdic and ohio division 
camco currently has million outstanding trust preferred securities with a maturity date of if needed  camco s agreement regarding these securities provides for a deferment of interest payment for up to consecutive quarters without default 
based on notification received from the frb on april   camco was required to exercise this provision to defer interest payments and has deferred a total of three quarters as of december  see note k to the financial statements in item below 
if the corporation desires to raise funds in the future  it may consider engaging in further offerings of preferred securities  debentures or other borrowings as well as issuance of capital stock  but any such strategic decisions would require regulatory approval 
further  as a result of entering into the mou with the frb on march   we are prohibited from paying dividends to our stockholders without first obtaining the approval of the frb 
our ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on our net earnings 
a continued decline in earnings increases in loan losses  or higher regulatory capital reserve requirements may jeopardize our ability to pay dividends at historical levels 
the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
core relationship deposits are the primary source of the bank s liquidity 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients with a strategy to increase the number of services products per client 
the corporation views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
we monitor and assess liquidity needs daily in order to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
camco s liquidity contingency funding plan identifies liquidity thresholds and red flags that may evidence liquidity concerns or future crises 
the contingency plan details specific actions to be taken by management and the board of directors 
it also identifies sources of emergency liquidity  both asset and liability based  should we encounter a liquidity crisis 
in conjunction with the corporation s asset liability and interest rate risk management activities  we actively monitor liquidity risk and analyze various scenarios that could impact or impair camco s ability to access emergency funding during a liquidity crisis 
liquid assets consist of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  investments and mortgage backed securities 
approximately million  or  of our 
table of contents investment portfolio is expected to mature or prepay during while these maturities could provide a significant source of liquidity in the short term  public unit deposits and repurchase agreements limit our ability to use these funds freely due to the collateral requirements of such 
state and local political subdivision deposits equaled million at december   and million at december  we may implement additional product strategies to lessen this restriction on our investment portfolio to increase our liquidity options 
additional sources of liquidity include deposits  borrowings and principal and interest repayments on loans 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and early loan and security prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions  and competition and are difficult to predict 
diversified and reliable sources of wholesale funds are utilized to augment core deposit funding 
borrowings may be used on a long or short term basis to compensate for reduction in other sources of funds or on a long term basis to support lending activities 
the bank utilizes its investment securities  certain loans and fhlb stock to provide collateral to support its borrowing needs 
management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available 
however  depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition  economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances  which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions 
one source of wholesale funding is brokered deposits 
consistent with its risk management policy and in response to the general tightening of credit and liquidity conditions in the financial markets at large  the bank has utilized brokered deposits 
at december   such deposits totaled approximately million  exclusive of cdars deposits 
approximately million of the corporation s certificate of deposit portfolio is scheduled to mature during depositors continue a preference toward short term certificates or other issuances less than months 
this places additional liquidity pressure on the corporation as competition for deposits is very strong in ohio  kentucky and west virginia 
a material loss of these short term deposits could force us to seek funding through contingency sources  which may negatively impact earnings 
fhlb advances are another funding source 
in the past  camco has depended heavily on borrowings to fund balance sheet growth 
while significant strategic and tactical focus is currently being placed on deposit growth  borrowings and additional borrowing capacity at the fhlb are still vital sources of liquidity and growth funding 
we have approximately million of additional borrowing capacity available as of december  however  our total borrowing capacity at the fhlb is dependent on the level of eligible collateral assets held by the bank and the bank s credit rating with the fhlb 
our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb decreased to million at december   from million at december  this capacity has decreased as our one to four family loan portfolio  the primary collateral for fhlb borrowings  has shrunk and the increase in nonperforming loans has reduced our credit rating and thereby increased its collateral requirements in compared to the inability of the bank to access contingency funding from the fhlb may significantly limit our growth and negatively affect earnings 
we have improved on balance sheet liquidity and in response to higher collateral maintenance requirements and decreases in our overall borrowing capacity 
we plan to continue to monitor our funding sources through brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings  but recognize that our current credit risk profile may restrict these sources 
our funds management group will monitor the deposit rates in our markets to allow for competitive pricing in order to raise funds through deposits 
funds in excess of loan demand and available borrowing repayments will be held in short term investments or federal funds sold 
we are taking these actions 
table of contents to proactively prepare for the possibility of continued deterioration in the credit markets and increases in our nonperforming loans  which may reduce our borrowing capacity at the fhlb further 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract as of december  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank repurchase agreements certificates of deposit subordinated debentures ohio equity funds for affordable housing amount of commitments per period commitments to originate loans revolving  open end lines family residential construction commercial real estate  other construction loan and land development loans commercial real estate  construction  and land development loans not secured by real estate other unused commitments stand by letters of credit total contractual obligations the subordinated debentures are redeemable at par  at camco s option  commencing september  the debentures mature on september  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan commitments 
based upon historical deposit flow data  the bank s competitive pricing in its market and management s experience  we believe that a significant portion of our maturing certificates of deposit in will remain with the bank  but recognize the significance of the risks discussed above 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term management process 
in the event that we should require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  internet deposits  and through the sales of loans and or securities 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we engage in off balance sheet credit related activities that could require us to make cash payments in the event that specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts of these activities represent the maximum exposure to the bank as further described in financial statement footnote note j commitments 
however  certain off balance sheet commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  therefore  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these off balance sheet activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of the bank s customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  levels of market interest rates  and by competition  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results from operations particularly dependent on the ohio economy 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
our asset liability management objective is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the board s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting tolerance levels for the net interest margin scenario changes developed simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
we consider interest rate risk to be camco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of camco s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
we employ an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the bank s board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the interest rate risk position of camco presented below is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming an instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the bank s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in net interest income nii and the economic value of equity eve in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
eve represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of an immediate and sustained and increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in nii and eve for the various rate shock levels at december  change in interest rates basis points nii change eve change the current simulation identifies a decreasing net interest income in a declining rate environment 
a contributing factor to this decline is the existing higher prepayment speeds incorporated into our model at year end along with decreased interest revenue due to higher non performing loans when compared to funding sources 
in a rising rate environment our net interest income increases due to the decreasing refinance opportunities and the significant amount of adjustable rate loans within our loan portfolio 
these assets will adjust faster than liabilities due to the lagging nature of adjustments in our deposit base 
these estimated changes in net interest income and economic value of equity are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  we have developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to freddie mac and fannie guidelines are sold upon origination 
a total of million and million of such loans were sold to freddie mac  fannie mae and other parties during and  respectively
