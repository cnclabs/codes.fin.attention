our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  were in our north america segment and were in our international segment as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who 
table of contents sell to our strategic and commercial customers  telesales teams  a team that sells to federal  state and local governments  and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
our global sales force is also a source of competitive advantage  which allows us to go to market across three key customer segments 
we identify these segments as strategic customers  commercial customers or middle market in our international segment  and small businesses 
in  we redesigned the go to market approach for our north america sales organization to increase performance and drive efficiencies 
we reorganized the sales force  consolidated channels  reallocated accounts and simplified account teaming structures to get closer to our customers and to improve the efficiency of our sales force 
we consolidated sales support functions  realigned around key industries in the strategic customer segment to increase cross sell opportunities and account penetration  and will leverage telesales to drive new customer acquisition more efficiently 
as a result of this reengineering initiative  we reduced the overall size of the north america sales force by approximately 
our customers we believe that different size customers have different needs and require different skill sets to service them 
accordingly  we have adopted a go to market sales strategy that focuses on distinct groups categorized internally as large customers  middle market customers and small business customers 
our principal customers within these groups are banks and other credit and financial institutions  manufacturers  wholesalers  retailers  government agencies  insurance companies and telecommunication companies  as well as sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue or of the revenue of our north american or international segments 
accordingly  neither we nor either of our segments is dependent on a single customer  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of either of our segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of market share and revenue 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in north america with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions 
our direct competitors in sales marketing solutions include companies such as experian and infogroup infousa 
in our internet solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s researcher  hoover s prospector and hoover s relationship manager products compete with other business information providers such as infousa 
new  less established entrants are also pursuing some of these same customers 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s exec and lite solutions mainly competes with advertising supported internet sites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and marketwatch  inc 
table of contents outside the us  the competitive environment varies by region and country 
in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as experian in the united kingdom uk 
in addition  we compete with certain companies such as coface for cross border business 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
in asia  we face competition in our risk management solutions business from a mix of local and global providers 
for example  we compete with sinotrust in china which is majority owned by experian  with teikoku data bank tdb in japan and with experian in india 
in addition  as in europe  the sales marketing solutions landscape throughout asia is localized and fragmented 
we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our trusted brand  our dunsright quality process  our winning culture and our financial flexibility form a powerful competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  maintain those third party relationships on whom we rely for data and certain operational services  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  service marks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications therefor 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  service marks  databases  software  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative 
table of contents technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process  through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy  and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our north america segment and corporate and approximately  were in our international segment 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in the north america segment 
works councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in the european and latin american operations of our international segment

item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we utilize single source providers in certain countries that support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on members of our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  
table of contents we have also outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition  processing and delivery and customer service processes  and we have outsourced various functions  such as our technology help desk and network management functions in the us and the uk 
if one or more data providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties or were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  be unable to make it available due to changing industry standards  substantially increase the cost of their data  not adhere to our data quality standards  or be acquired by a competitor who would cause this to occur  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including third parties with whom we have strategic relationships  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  having a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
in addition  if we change a significant outsource provider  an existing provider makes significant changes to the way they conduct their operations  or we seek to bring in house certain services performed today by third parties  we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business performance is dependent upon successful implementation and the ongoing operation of our recently announced two year strategic technology initiative  the failure of which could materially impact our business and financial results 
in february  we announced an approximately two year strategic technology initiative to be implemented at an aggregate cost of approximately million to million 
we will rely in part on third party providers to implement a new data supply chain and update our technology infrastructure and to thereafter run such operations both within d b and from their own remote locations 
we have started the detailed planning of this initiative and upon completion we expect that it will simplify and re architect our data supply chain in order to  among other things  supply intra day updates  create a services layer to optimize access to our data for customers and third parties  consolidate our legacy products to provide fewer more impactful applications for customers  accelerate revenue growth in our north america segment upon the completion of the initiative  and significantly reduce our technology costs upon completion of the initiative 
in the event we fail to successfully develop the plan  and execute on the initiative  including hiring and retaining appropriate technology personnel  engage and manage third parties  re architect our data supply chain  and simplify our product portfolio while migrating our customers to new products  and maintain such data and technology operations on an ongoing basis  we will not achieve our expected revenue acceleration or growth  or the anticipated cost savings from this initiative  and we could experience a significant competitive disadvantage in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  and credit insurers 

table of contents in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large internet search engine companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services 
weak economic conditions also can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are facing competition outside the us  and our competitors could develop an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
we are also facing competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
in addition  consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they play  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  such as detailed trade data  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending  obtain and deliver reliable and high quality business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  adopt and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure to support product delivery as customer needs and preferences change and competitors offer more sophisticated products  attract and retain a high performance workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management in our international segment of the members of our d b worldwide network 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public which is based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance 
this includes  for example  assumptions regarding our ability to grow revenue  to grow operating income  to achieve desired tax rates and to generate cash 
we believe that our financial 
table of contents guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of our view of our near term financial performance 
such financial guidance may not always be accurate  due to our inability to meet the assumptions we make and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors and in our public filings with the sec or otherwise 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance as we conduct our operations throughout the year  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we may lose key business assets or suffer interruptions in product delivery  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and internet sites that we use in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations or change management processes in connection with our introduction of new online products or services to prevent a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or internet sites could cause interruptions in operations that adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements and materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database  whether inadvertently or through the actions of a third party  which may be on the rise  could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 
in addition  we must continue to invest in our database to improve and maintain the quality  timeliness and coverage of the data contained therein if we are to maintain our competitive positioning in the marketplace 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the third parties to whom we grant non exclusive licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 
our brand and its attributes are key assets of the company 
our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of data quality  business practices and overall financial condition 
negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation with customers and the public  which could make it difficult for us to attract and maintain customers 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  negatively impact our reputation  or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand  negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue  and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals or a shift in product mix that results in a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
as contracts are renewed  we have  and may continue to experience  a shift in product mix underlying such contracts 
this could result in the deferral of increased amounts of revenue into future periods as a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of our contracts rather than upfront at contract signing 
although this may cause our financial results from period to period to vary substantially  such change in revenue recognition will not change the total revenue recognized over the life of our contracts 
we may be adversely affected by the current economic environment 
as a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers or vendors may experience problems with their earnings  cash flow  or both 
this may cause our customers to delay  cancel or significantly decrease their purchases from us  and we may experience delays in payment or their inability to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  our vendors may substantially increase their prices without notice 
any such change in the behavior of our customers or vendors may materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
if economic conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business  operating results  and or access to credit markets 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data and may impact our financial results 
certain types of information we gather  compile and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain markets in which we operate  particularly in our international markets 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public and companies regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new laws and regulations 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date materially impacted our business and financial results 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information could result in limitations being imposed on our operations  increased compliance or litigation expense and or loss of revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  governmental agencies may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers or provide alternative services  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
in addition  any such price increases or alternative services may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our solutions  which could materially adversely affect our revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use and purchase business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business and financial results 
table of contents would be materially adversely affected 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing solutions beyond data  such as enhanced analytics and assisting with their data integration efforts 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to develop a strong value proposition  including simplifying our solutions and pricing offerings  to enhance our marketing efforts to these customers and to improve our service to them 
to address customer needs for pricing certainty and increased access to our solutions  we provide subscription pricing plans through our preferred pricing agreement and our preferred pricing agreement with dnbi 
these subscription pricing plans provide expanded access to our risk management solutions in a way that provides more certainty over related costs to the customer  which  in turn  generally results in customers increasing their spend on our solutions 
these plans have been an important driver of our growth from inception in to date 
our success moving forward is dependent  in part  on the continued penetration of these offerings and the successful rollout of similar programs in various markets around the world 
similarly  our continued success is dependent on customers acceptance of our dnbi offering 
acquisitions  joint ventures or similar strategic relationships may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies or enter into joint ventures or similar strategic relationships 
these transactions are subject to the following risks acquisitions  joint ventures or similar relationships may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any such transaction into our operations  we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any such transaction  and risks  exposures and liabilities of acquired entities or other third parties with whom we undertake a transaction  that arise from such third parties activities prior to undertaking a transaction with us 
we have no direct management control over third party members of the d b worldwide network who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
the d b worldwide network is comprised of wholly owned subsidiaries  joint ventures that we either control or hold a minority interest in  and third party members who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
while third party member participation in the d b worldwide network is controlled by commercial services agreements and the use of our trademarks is controlled by license agreements  we have no direct management control over these members beyond the terms of the agreements 
as a result  actions or inactions taken by these third party members may have a material impact on our business and financial results 
for example  one or more third party members may provide a product or service that does not adhere to our data quality standards  fail to comply with d b brand and communication standards  engage in illegal or unethical business practices  elect not to support new or revised products and services or other strategic initiatives  or fail to execute other data or distribution contract requirements 
such actions or inactions may have an impact on customer confidence in the d b brand globally  which could materially adversely impact our business and financial results 

table of contents we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel  including members of our sales force and technology team  which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success and financial results also depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels 
this includes members of our sales force on whom we rely for the vast majority of our revenue  and members of our technology team on whom we rely to continually maintain and upgrade all of our technology operations and maintain and develop our products  and to appropriately use the time and resources of such individuals 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or key members of our sales or technology teams  or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees  including members of our sales force and technology team  with appropriate qualifications 
our operations in the international segment are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside north america 
for the three years ended december   and  our international segment accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
our international business is subject to many challenges  the most significant being our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors who may have a competitive advantage with us because they are not restricted by us laws with which we require our international segment to comply  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customer s need to purchase our data 
our international strategy includes the leveraging of our d b worldwide network to improve our data quality 
we form and manage these strategic alliances to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic relationships may not be successful or may be subject to ownership change 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business or the business of third parties on whom we depend 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors may include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions  competition from government agencies in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic alliances  including the d b worldwide network  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 

table of contents we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
successful execution of our strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility initiatives  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to continually adapt and improve our organizational design and efficiency to meet the changing needs of our business and our customers  our ability to implement all of the actions required under this program within the established time frame  our ability to implement actions that require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  entering into or amending agreements with third party vendors to renegotiate terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources 
if we fail to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth from new initiatives  our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under note contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  certain of these matters could materially adversely affect our business and financial results

on december   we sold our italian real estate business for million  which was a part of our international segment  and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the italian real estate business as discontinued operations 
we have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented as set forth in this annual report on form k 
we have recorded the resulting gain of million both pre tax and after tax from the sale in the first quarter of in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue  which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our italian operations 
this sale has been classified as a divestiture 
our divested business contributed of our total revenue for the year ended december  and of our total revenue for each of the years ended december  and see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
from time to time we have analyzed and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of reallocating our spending from low growth or low value activities to activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
management is committed through this process to examining how every dollar is spent  and optimizing between variable and fixed costs to ensure flexibility in changes to our operating expense base as we make strategic choices 
this enables us to continually and systematically identify improvement opportunities in terms of quality  cost and customer experience 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures before such charges in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as 
table of contents corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
additionally  for fiscal years  and  our non gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america measures reflect results on a continuing operations basis 
it may be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges may occur in the future 
we monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases  dividend payments and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for  or superior to  net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate our north america risk management solutions based on two metrics subscription  and non subscription  and dnbi and non dnbi 
we define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use within predefined ranges  subject to certain conditions 
in these instances  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams 
we define dnbi as our interactive  customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global dunsright information  comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non dnbi as all other revenue streams 
management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our north america risk management solutions revenue 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures eg  results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
overview as of january   canada has been moved out of our international segment and into our renamed north america segment formerly our united states us segment

of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents if actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial accounting standards board fasb launches accounting standards codification in june  the fasb issued fasb accounting standards codification tm asc  generally accepted accounting principles  or asc the codification 
this authoritative guidance establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for gaap for use in financial statements  except for securities and exchange commission sec rules and interpretative releases  which are also authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is nonauthoritative 
following the codification  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asu  which will serve to update the codification  provide background information about the authoritative guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the codification 
gaap is not intended to be changed as a result of the codification  but it has changed the way the authoritative guidance is organized and presented 
as a result  these changes made an impact on how we reference gaap in our financial statements and in our accounting policies 
where appropriate  we have conformed  throughout this form k  references to both the codification and or the previous gaap source reference 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations through june   we offered to substantially all of our us based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account us qualified plan 
the defined benefit plan covered active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of spin off companies 
the benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employee s annual compensation 
the percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranged from to based on age and service 
amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the year treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the internal revenue service 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the company 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  effective june   we amended the us qualified plan and one of the us non qualified plans  known as the us pension benefit equalization plan the pbep 
any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits  other than interest on such amounts  will accrue under the us qualified plan and the pbep 
our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans  representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
we also provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees  who retire with years of vesting service after age  are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs 
table of contents and obligations are determined actuarially 
effective march   we will eliminate company paid life insurance benefits for retirees 
in addition  we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios  reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 
this assumption was in each of the years  and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december  the us qualified plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
based on the factors noted above  the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually 
for our us plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to determine pension cost for our us pension plans was  and for  and  respectively 
for  we decreased the discount rate to from for all our us pension plans 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods or life expectancy of plan participants to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor 
the purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the lower amortization of 
table of contents actuarial loss in for the us qualified plan  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to a change  starting in november according to our accounting policy  in amortization period from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants 
the decrease is substantially offset by the impact of a larger unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in higher amortization of actuarial loss in for our us non qualified plans and us plans was primarily due to lower discount rates applied to the plan at december   as well as a larger unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
for our pension plans  we recorded net pension periodic cost of million  net pension periodic income of million and net pension periodic cost of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a major component of the net pension periodic cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
for our pension plans we recorded i for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans  ii for the year ended december   a total investment loss of million which was comprised of a loss of million in our us qualified plan and a loss of million in our non us plans  and iii for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the non us plans was  million and million  respectively  compared with the fair value of its plan assets of  million and million  respectively 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity deficit 
we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset  on a plan by plan basis with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  in our shareholders equity deficit  net of tax 
accordingly  the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs 
these unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs will be amortized out of equity deficit based on an actuarial calculation each period 
gains losses and prior service costs that arise during the year are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income oci which is then reflected in aoci 
we recorded a net loss of million and net loss of million in oci  net of applicable tax  in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the actuarial gain loss and prior service cost arising during the period and the amortization of such items 
the decreased loss in was primarily due to the improvement of the funded status for our us qualified plan from a deficit of million at december  compared to a deficit of million at december   driven by better asset performance in compared to a significant asset loss in the positive impact from better asset performance was partially mitigated by a lower discount rate at december  for information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements  please see future liquidity sources and uses of funds pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
in connection with tax proceedings  we 
table of contents utilize a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract fee is fixed and determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our risk management solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow customers unlimited access to risk information 
revenue on this type of contract is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year

once the contract amount is fully used  additional risk information can be purchased at per item prices which may be different than those in the original contract 
revenue on these contracts is recognized on a per item basis as information is purchased and delivered to the customer 
if customers do not use the full amount of their contract and forfeit the unused portion  we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration 
where a data file of risk information is sold with periodic updates to that information  a portion of the revenue related to the updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered  usually on a quarterly or monthly basis over the term of the contract

table of contents sales of software that are considered to be more than incidental are recognized in revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed  if required 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
we have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements 
the multiple elements or deliverables may include access to our business information databases  information data files  updates  software and services 
to account for each deliverable as a separate unit of accounting  they each must meet all of the following separation criteria the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the undelivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria  the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
we obtain vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of a deliverable by monitoring the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
where we are unable to use vsoe  we may use the price at which we or a third party sell a similar product to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis 
if we do not have fair value for the delivered items  the contract fee is allocated to the undelivered items based on their fair values and the remaining residual amount  if any  is allocated to the delivered items 
after the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method from those described above for each unit of accounting  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria are combined with an undelivered unit of accounting 
we generally recognize revenue for a combined unit of accounting based on the method most appropriate for the last delivered item 
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information solutions and generally relates to deferral of subscription revenue 
deferred revenue is included in current liabilities in the balance sheet and is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies

table of contents matters impacting both operating expenses and selling and administrative expenses pension  postretirement and k plan for our pension plans globally  we had a net pension periodic cost of million  net pension periodic income of million and net pension periodic cost of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the pension cost income was due to the following the discount rates applied to the pension plans were major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the pension cost 
the discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our us plans for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense was also a major factor in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
actuarial loss amortization was largely impacted by the discount rate and plan experience 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the loss amortization 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to our us plans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
higher pension income in was primarily due to the higher discount rate applied to our us plans and the major international plans  as well as lower actuarial loss amortization included in we expect that the net pension cost in will be approximately million for all of our global pension plans 
lower discount rates and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization will increase our pension cost 
the discount rates applied to our us plans and major international plan at january   are basis points and basis points lower than  respectively 
this increase in pension cost is substantially offset by the impact of a longer amortization period applied to our us qualified plan 
starting in november  the amortization period applied to the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses for our us qualified plan has been changed from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants 
the change was the result of almost all the plan participants being deemed inactive 
we had postretirement benefit income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lower postretirement benefit income in was primarily due to full amortization of the prior service credit 
this prior service credit was related to the plan amendment to limit our insurance premium contribution 
higher postretirement benefit income in was primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial gain  which was driven by positive plan experience and changes in assumptions 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million in the increase in income from to is primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credit  resulting from a plan amendment which will be effective march   that eliminates the company paid life insurance benefits for retirees 
in addition  we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible 
we had expense associated with our k plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in expense in was due to the amendment of our employer matching provision in the k plan effective in february   to decrease our match formula from to of a team member s contributions and to decrease the maximum match from seven percent to three percent of such team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 
the increase in expense in from was due to the amendment of our matching policy in the k plan effective july   to increase our match formula from to of a team member s contributions and to increase the maximum match to seven percent from six percent  of such team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 

table of contents effective in april  we will increase the employer maximum match from three percent to seven percent of a team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations and we will continue to match of a team member s contributions 
we consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs  and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decreases for the years ended december  and  were primarily driven by a decrease in the overall number of employees eligible for stock options 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our restricted stock  restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily driven by performance based awards being below target  resulting in lower expense 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily due to the addition of the annual grant and special grants awarded in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan espp of million  million and million  respectively 
we consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization year ended december  vs 
year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily driven by a reassessment of the useful lives of our computer software in conjunction with changes in our technology strategy 
we review the estimated remaining useful lives of our computer software and may extend the useful life when events and circumstances indicate the computer software can operate beyond its original or current useful life 
prior to the second quarter of  the useful life of computer software assets was typically three to five years 
we now expect the useful life of our back end and back office software to be in the range of five to eight years  and we have extended the useful lives accordingly 
this reassessment included a review of the major components of our strategy and consideration of the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors on the useful life of these assets 
the impact of this change was effective in the second quarter of  and the impact for the year ended december  was a reduction in software amortization expense by approximately million after tax per diluted share 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures and increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities 

table of contents year ended december  vs

restructuring charge restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with asc  nonretirement postemployment benefits  or asc  and or asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  or asc  as appropriate

under asc  we establish a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including severance and lease termination obligations  and other related costs  when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan 
we reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities  if necessary 
the determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing arrangement as described in asc or under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by asc inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings  we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings 
these estimates may vary significantly from actual costs depending  in part  upon factors that may be beyond our control 
we will continue to review the status of our restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to these obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates

table of contents earnings per share effective january   we updated our policy to reflect the authoritative guidance in asc  which clarifies that instruments granted in share based payment transactions eg  stock based awards are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method 
the two class method requires earnings to be allocated between common shareholders and holders of participating securities 
all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and should be included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 
the eps calculation is applied retrospectively to all prior period eps data presented 
the impact of the adoption resulted in a four cent and two cent decrease to our basic and diluted eps for each of the years ended december  and  respectively

the lower demand in will impact our financial results  and  as such  revenue will remain weak through the first half of the year 
we expect a gradual recovery as unfolds 
for  we expect revenue in north america to be slightly better than we expect the first quarter revenue decline for north america to be similar to our fourth quarter and then show a gradual improvement in trends over the course of the year as a result of improving upfront customer commitment trends  greater new customer acquisition due to our new go to market strategy  and the benefit of our product investments we made in we expect our risk management solutions revenue results in the first half of to continue to feel the impact of lower up front demand for our subscription products 
specifically  we expect the risk management solutions rate of decline to get slightly worse in the first quarter of than it was in the fourth quarter of  before gradually improving over the rest of as our new customer initiatives gain traction 
in addition  since our internet solutions business is primarily a subscription business  the results reflect our weak up front demand in sales earlier in as a result  we expect these trends to continue to be weak in the first half of  before stabilizing in the second half of north america operating income north america operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or

we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions 
from time to time  we use foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  from time to time  we use interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt or in anticipation of future debt issuance  as discussed under interest rate risk management below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk management in january and december  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively  and designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against variability in cash flows related to our bank revolving credit facility 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and  as such  changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
at december   the balance of net derivative losses associated with these swaps included in aoci was approximately million 

table of contents in january  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of the april debt issuance 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and  as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in aoci 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes in april with a face value of million that mature on april   bearing interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were executed  resulting in a payment of million at the date of termination 
the payments are recorded in aoci  and will be amortized over the life of the notes 
in february and september  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in aoci 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were executed  resulting in proceeds of approximately million at the date of termination 
the proceeds are recorded in aoci and will be amortized over the life of the notes 
at december   we had a million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates  which we terminated on april   and then entered into a new million  five year bank revolving credit facility  which expires in april on january   we exercised a million expansion feature on our million credit facility expanding the total facility to million 
borrowings under the million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates 
at december  and december   we had million and million of floating rate debt outstanding under the facility  respectively 
a basis point increase decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding variable rate debt at december   would result in an incremental increase decrease in annual interest expense of approximately million 
foreign exchange risk management we have numerous offices in various countries outside north america and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers 
our international operations generated approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets as of december  and  respectively  were located outside of north america 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and investments 
we use short term  foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollar 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 

table of contents as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  from time to time  we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  we did not have any option contracts outstanding 
at december  and  we had a notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively  of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated loans 
realized gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  if exchange rates were to increase on average from year end levels  without the benefit of having hedging activities  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  without the benefit of having hedging activities  the unrealized gain would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in connection with our focus on delivering total shareholder return  we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash  maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash first  making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth  second  investing in acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth  and third  continuing to return cash to shareholders 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements  is sufficient to meet our short term needs twelve months or less  including restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  excluding the legal matters identified in such note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable 
in addition  we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on total shareholder return 
we have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and share repurchases 
such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility  when needed 
the unprecedented disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions 
at this point in time our liquidity has not been impacted by the credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
management continues to closely monitor our liquidity  the credit markets and our financial counterparties 
however  management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment
