a portion of our total revenue consists of reimbursement for direct costs we incur  such as postage related to document management services 
we reflect the operating revenue from these reimbursed direct costs as a separate line item on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
revenue originating from reimbursed direct costs was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this increase corresponded to the increase in reimbursed direct costs 
although reimbursed operating revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue exclusive of revenue originating from reimbursed direct costs  which we refer to as operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  was million in  an increase of million as compared to million in the prior year

during april  the holders of the contingent convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to extend the maturity of the convertible notes from june to june as a result  we will continue to pay interest  at a rate of per annum  during the extension period on any convertible notes that remain outstanding 
the holders of the convertible notes may chose at any time on or prior to june  to convert some or all of the notes into our common shares 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conversion right 
we estimated the fair value of the option to extend immediately prior to the note holders vote to extend and recorded a final adjustment to the fair value of the option to extend the subordinated convertible notes maturity 
we are currently amortizing the exercise date fair value of the option as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the extension 
during both and we recognized a reduction to interest expense of approximately million related to the amortization of the carrying value of the option to extend the maturity term subsequent to the extension date 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate for was compared with an effective rate of for the prior year 
the increase compared to the prior year was primarily related to non deductible equity compensation in for which a comparable expense did not exist in the prior year and approximately million of additional state income taxes  offset by million of both research credits and benefits related to the domestic production activities deduction 
state taxes  non deductible equity compensation and foreign losses on which we have recorded valuation allowances were the primary reasons our tax rate was higher than the statutory federal rate of 
we have significant operations located in new york city that are subject to state and local tax rates that are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
although our income tax returns for and later are generally subject to exam  it is reasonably possible that we will recognize approximately million of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of anticipated lapses in the statute of limitations within twelve months of our reporting date

results of operations by segment the following segment discussion is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
electronic discovery segment electronic discovery operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
the change from the prior year primarily related to a slower pace in the start up of litigation matters in  as well as industry pricing pressures  the impact of which was an approximate decline in the average price of services  both of which can be attributed to the current economic climate 
while we believe the national financial  banking and economic crisis that began in the fourth quarter of and that continued in had a direct effect on the volume of electronic discovery in litigation and regulatory proceedings in  we cannot quantify the impact in or predict the extent to which continuing economic and financial concerns will affect our electronic discovery business in electronic discovery direct and administrative expenses  including reimbursed direct costs  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was due to a million increase in compensation related expense  a million increase in building and equipment lease expense and utility expense  a million increase in outside services  and a million increase in software maintenance costs 
the increases in expense were primarily related to the expansion of service offerings and geographic expansion  including certain costs related to data center expansion 
bankruptcy segment bankruptcy operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate restructuring engagements  which is the direct result of an increase in chapter bankruptcy filings 
corporate restructuring engagements are generally long term  multi year assignments 
this has provided us with a strong inventory of cases in the early stages of administration 
the increase in revenue related to corporate restructuring engagements was slightly offset by a decline in chapter bankruptcy trustee fees 
the chapter fees reflect year end deposit portfolio increasing in compared to  and the impact of lower pricing  resulting from short term 
table of contents interest rates lowering our pricing formulas to floor levels 
short term interest rates began declining in the fourth quarter of and continued to decline in bankruptcy direct and administrative expenses  including reimbursed direct costs  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the prior year

compensation related expense increased million  expense related to outside services increased million  call center expense increased million  legal notification costs increased million  and building and equipment lease expense increased million 
also contributing to the increase in costs was an increase in reimbursed direct costs of million  which directly corresponded to the increase in revenue originating from reimbursed direct costs 
settlement administration settlement administration operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the planned wind down of the major analog to digital conversion contract during  which declined million from the prior year  as well as a decrease in legal notification and settlement revenue of million

effective tax rate our effective tax rate was for compared with an effective rate of for the prior year 
our tax rate is generally higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
several of our subsidiaries operate in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
the increase in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily due to a larger proportion of our income being taxed in high tax rate jurisdictions and the reversal of a valuation allowance related to our united kingdom net operating loss carryforward in during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the united kingdom net operating loss would be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to the remaining net operating loss carryforward asset resulting in a lower effective tax rate in net income we had net income of million for compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
growth in our settlement administration segment  resulting from a large contract in support of the federal government s analog to digital conversion program  as well as the decline in net interest expense  contributed to the increase in net income

critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  business combinations  goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  income taxes and derivative financial instruments to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition we have agreements with clients pursuant to which we deliver various services each month 
following is a description of significant sources of our revenue fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services defined by client contracts  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  disbursement services  project management  collection and forensic services  document review services  and conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies based primarily on the size and complexity of the engagement 
hosting fees based on the amount of data stored 
deposit based fees  earned primarily based on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
the fees we earn are based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients and may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including direct notification  media campaign  and advertising management in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement 
reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
non software arrangements services related to electronic discovery and settlement administration are billed based on volume 
for these contractual arrangements  we have identified each deliverable service element 
based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate revenue to the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period 
revenue is recognized as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectability is 
table of contents reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a customer deposit until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the dollar level of average monthly deposits held by the trustees with that financial institution related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered elements  which are postcontract customer support services 
this revenue  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
revenue related to postcontract customer support is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectibility is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware  such as desktop computers  monitors  and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  and there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieve our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  is included in the consolidated statements of income as a component of case management services revenue 
reimbursements we have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily postage 
reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statements of income as operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs and as reimbursed direct costs  respectively 
share based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based awards at fair value and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
to date  the share based compensation awards we have issued are stock option and nonvested share awards also referred to as 
table of contents restricted stock awards 
we are required to estimate the share based awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could affect our operating results 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant  as well as other assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards  the estimated period of time that we expect the stock options will be held  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 
we estimate our expected volatility based on implied volatilities from traded share options on our stock and on our stock s historical volatility based on daily stock prices 
we have estimated the expected term of our share options based on the historical exercise pattern of groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
historically  we have not paid dividends  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
the fair value of nonvested share awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock 
we record deferred tax assets for share based awards that potentially result in deductions on our income tax returns 
we estimate the deferred tax asset based on the amount of share based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we will receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax asset we record is based upon the share based compensation expense in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
recognition of share based compensation expense has had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our direct cost of services and general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of income  and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including quoted market prices and estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
acquisition related costs for potential and completed acquisitions are expensed  as incurred  and are included in other operating expense income in our consolidated statements of income 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
table of contents over the intangible asset s estimated economic benefit period  generally from five to ten years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we have determined that our reporting units are bankruptcy trustee management  corporate restructuring  electronic discovery  and settlement administration 
goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  a change in strategic direction  legal factors  operating performance indicators  a change in the competitive environment  the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
our annual test is performed as of july each year 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we considered both a market approach and an income approach in order to develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of our annual impairment test 
when evaluating the market approach  we determined that directly comparable publicly traded companies did not exist  primarily due to the unique business model characteristics and projected growth of each reporting unit 
instead  we utilized a discounted projected future cash flow analysis income approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
in addition  financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital  used to determine our discount rate  and through our stock price  used to determine our market capitalization 
we may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to measure the potential impairment charge 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  as of july   which is the date of our most recent impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit  except for the bankruptcy trustee management reporting unit 
the bankruptcy trustee management reporting unit had approximately 
table of contents million of goodwill allocated to it and the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
identifiable intangible assets each year we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
all of our identifiable intangible assets have finite lives 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  information resulting from our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable which would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  income taxes a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of our tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that sufficient future taxable income  taking into consideration tax planning strategies  may not generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize net deferred tax assets  we may be required to establish or increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 
this charge may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the recognition of a change in enacted tax rates may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense and on our consolidated statements of income 
we follow accounting guidance which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under this guidance  tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
application of this guidance requires numerous estimates based on available information 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  and our recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
as we obtain additional information  we may need to periodically adjust our recognized tax positions and tax benefits 
these periodic adjustments may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this new guidance was reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of january  the cumulative effect adjustment does not include items that would not be recognized in earnings  such as the effect on tax positions related to business combinations

derivative financial instruments in august of  in order to limit our economic exposure to market fluctuations in interest rates  we purchased one month libor based interest rate floor options with a total notional amount of million and initial contractual maturity of three years 
we recorded this derivative instrument in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
as the interest rate floor options were not designated as an accounting hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded each period in current earnings 
for the year ended december   the change in the fair value of the interest rate floor options was recognized as an unrealized gain of million and was included as a component of other operating income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during february  we sold the interest rate floor options and realized a million gain 
the million difference between the realized gain of million and the previously recognized gain of million is included as a component of other operating income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december  and  we did not hold any interest rate floor options  other derivatives  or auction rate securities 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  new guidance was issued for the recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities and equity in business combinations 
this guidance was effective for us as of january  due to these new guidelines  we now expense  as incurred  acquisition related costs for potential and completed acquisitions 
acquisition related costs expensed in were approximately million and are included in other operating expense income in our consolidated statements of income 
this guidance also requires the recognition of changes in an acquirer s income tax valuation allowance on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date to be expensed 
this new guidance will primarily apply to all future acquisitions

in june  new guidance was issued that clarified that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents before vesting should be considered participating securities  and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
this guidance was effective for us as of january  with the requirement that all prior period income per share data presented to be adjusted retroactively 
we have determined that nonvested share awards that were granted in the first quarter of are participating securities as defined by this guidance because they have equivalent common stock dividend rights 
accordingly  we have included these shares in our basic and diluted share calculations 
table of contents as appropriate 
there is no prior period impact of this guidance as there were no participating securities outstanding prior to the first quarter of details of the income per share calculation are described in note in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on three issues discussed at its june  meeting pertaining to how an entity should evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions  how the currency in which the strike price of an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is denominated affects the determination of whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock  and how the issuer should account for market based employee stock option valuation 
this guidance was effective for us january  and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position 
in april  new guidance was issued that addressed application issues raised by preparers  auditors  and members of the legal profession on initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance was effective for us for any business combinations completed on or after january  this guidance has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position as we have not completed any business combinations since the date of adoption

recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards require entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
these new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  however early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the pending adoption of these standards on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these new standards amend the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products 
these new standards are effective for 
table of contents us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  however early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the pending adoption of these standards on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance that require entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures related to level and level fair value measurements are effective for us in and the disclosures related to level fair value measurements are effective for us in the update requires new disclosures only  and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed include interest rates under our senior revolving credit facility  foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation  and fluctuations in short term interest rates on a portion of our bankruptcy trustee revenue 
interest rate risk interest on our senior revolving credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points over the libor rate 
there were no amounts due under our senior revolving credit facility as of december  or  thereby we had no market risk exposure 
as of december   we had market risk exposure to interest rates as we held interest rate floor options with a notional value of million 
during february  we sold the interest rate floor options and realized a million gain  thereby eliminating our market risk exposure related to these instruments 
at december  and  we did not hold any interest rate floor options or other derivatives 
foreign currency risk we have operations in the united kingdom  brussels and hong kong  therefore  a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred in a currency other than us dollars 
we do not utilize hedge instruments to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the appropriate functional currency 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs
