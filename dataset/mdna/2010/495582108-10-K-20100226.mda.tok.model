item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
industries the global human pharmaceutical and animal health industries are highly competitive and each includes a variety of participants  including large and small branded pharmaceutical companies  specialty and niche market human pharmaceutical and or animal health companies  biotechnology firms  large and small research and drug development organizations  and generic drug manufacturers 
these participants compete on a number of bases  including technological innovation  clinical efficacy  safety  convenience or ease of administration and cost effectiveness 
in order to promote their products  industry participants devote considerable resources to  as applicable  advertising  marketing and sales force personnel  distribution mechanisms and relationships with medical and research centers  physicians  patient advocacy and support groups  veterinarians  commercial animal food manufacturers  wholesalers and integrated cattle  swine and poultry producers 
the human pharmaceutical industry is affected by the following factors  among others the aging of the patient population  including diseases specific to the aging process and demographic factors  including obesity  diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and patient and physician demand for products that meet chronic or unmet medical needs  technological innovation  both in drug discovery and corporate processes  merger and acquisition activity whereby pharmaceutical companies acquire one another  biotechnology companies  or particular products  
table of contents cost containment and downward price pressure from managed care organizations and governmental entities  both in the united states and in other countries  increasing drug development  manufacturing and compliance costs for pharmaceutical producers  the actions of pharmaceutical companies that produce generic products and challenges to patent protection and sales exclusivity  more frequent product liability litigation  increased governmental scrutiny of the healthcare sector  including issues of product promotion  patient safety  cost  efficacy and reimbursement insurance matters  as well as legislative and regulatory developments  and the cost of advertising and marketing  including direct to consumer advertising on television and in print 
the animal health industry is affected by the following factors  among others technological innovation  both in drug discovery and corporate processes  merger and acquisition activity whereby animal health companies acquire one another  biotechnology companies  or particular products  cost containment and downward price pressure  increased drug development  manufacturing and compliance costs for producers of animal health products  more frequent product liability litigation  and increased governmental scrutiny of the sector  including governmental restrictions on the use of antibiotics in certain food producing animals 
sales and marketing branded prescription pharmaceuticals the commercial operations organization for our branded prescription pharmaceuticals business  which includes sales and marketing  is based in bridgewater  new jersey 
we have a sales force consisting of approximately employees in the united states and puerto rico 
we distribute our branded prescription pharmaceutical products primarily through wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
these products are ordinarily dispensed to the public through pharmacies as a result of prescriptions written by physicians and other licensed practitioners 
our marketing and sales promotions for branded prescription pharmaceutical products principally target general family practitioners  internal medicine physicians  neurologists  pain specialists  surgeons and hospitals through detailing and sampling to encourage physicians to prescribe our products 
the sales force is supported by telemarketing and direct mail  as well as by advertising in trade publications and representation at regional and national medical conventions 
we identify and target physicians using data available from suppliers of prescriber prescription data 
similar to other pharmaceutical companies  our principal customers for our branded prescription pharmaceutical products are wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
in recent years  the wholesale distributor network for branded prescription pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation  which has increased our customer concentration and that of other industry participants 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross sales were attributable to three key wholesalers cardinal bindley  mckesson corporation  and amerisource bergen corporation 
animal health our animal health products of our wholly owned subsidiary alpharma are marketed through a staff of over sales and technical service and marketing employees  many of whom are veterinarians and 
table of contents nutritionists 
sales offices are located in the us  europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia 
elsewhere  our animal health products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and other third party sales companies 
sales are made principally to commercial animal feed manufacturers  wholesalers and integrated cattle  swine and poultry producers 
although the customer base for our animal health products is not significantly concentrated  consolidation is taking place 
accordingly  as consolidation continues  our animal health business may become more dependent on certain individual customers 
meridian auto injector we have a supply agreement with dey  lp  in which we granted dey the exclusive right to market  distribute  and sell epipen worldwide 
we manufacture and supply epipen products to dey at prices established under the agreement 
dey may determine the prices at which the products are sold to third parties 
the agreement provides for minimum quantities to be purchased by dey based upon prior purchase quantities and upon certain minimum rates of growth 
these minimum quantities are subject to adjustment in the event of competition entering the market 
we are entitled to receive  in connection with the sale of certain products by dey  royalty payments equal to a low single digit percentage of dey s net sales of these products 
because the conditions under which we receive these royalty payments were met in the fourth quarter of  we will receive these payments going forward 
the supply agreement expires december  we also maintain the exclusive rights to market and sell epipen in canada through accordingly  through a team of sales professionals  we market epipen to allergists  pediatricians  internal medicine physicians  general practitioners and pharmacists across canada 
through a team of internal sales professionals  we market a portfolio of acute care auto injector products to the pre hospital emergency services market  which includes us federal  state and local governments  public health agencies  emergency medical personnel and first responders and approved foreign governments 
competition branded prescription pharmaceuticals we compete with numerous other pharmaceutical companies  including large  global pharmaceutical companies  for the acquisition of products and technologies in later stages of development 
we also compete with other pharmaceutical companies for currently marketed products and product line acquisitions 
additionally  our products are subject to competition from products with similar qualities 
our branded prescription pharmaceutical products may be subject to competition from alternate therapies during the period of patent protection and thereafter from generic equivalents 
some of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products currently face competition from generic substitutes and others may face competition from generic substitutes in the future 
for a manufacturer to launch a generic substitute  it must prove to the fda that the branded prescription pharmaceutical product and the generic substitute are therapeutically equivalent 
the manufacturers of generic products typically do not bear the research and development costs and  consequently  are able to offer such products at considerably lower prices than the branded equivalents 
there are  however  a number of factors which enable some products to remain profitable once patent protection has ceased 
these include the establishment of a strong brand image with the prescriber or the consumer  supported by the development of a broader range of alternative formulations than the manufacturers of generic products typically supply 
the fda requires that generic applicants claiming invalidity or non infringement of patents listed by a new drug application nda holder give the nda holder notice each time an abbreviated new drug application anda which claims invalidity or non infringement of listed patents is either submitted or amended 
if the nda holder files a patent infringement suit against the generic applicant within days of receiving such notice  the fda is barred or stayed from approving the anda for months unless specific events occur sooner 
to avoid multiple month stays for the same branded drug  the relevant provisions of the hatch waxman act usc j and indicate that a month stay will only attach to patents that are listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  which 
table of contents we refer to as the fda s orange book  at the time an anda is originally filed 
although the anda filer is still required to certify against a newly listed patent  and the nda holder can still bring suit based upon infringement of that patent  such a suit will not trigger an additional month stay of fda approval of the anda 
patents that claim a composition of matter relating to a drug or certain methods of using a drug are required to be listed in the fda s orange book 
the fda s regulations prohibit listing of certain types of patents 
thus  some patents that are issued are not eligible for listing in the fda s orange book and thus not eligible for protection by a month stay of fda approval of the anda 
animal health segment our animal health products compete in a highly competitive global market under the alpharma brand name  customer service and price 
some of our competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities 
some of the principal global competitors include eli lilly and company elanco  pennfield  phibro animal health  novartis and huvepharma 
given our strong market position in mfas and experience in obtaining requisite fda approvals for combination claims  we believe we have a competitive advantage in marketing mfas under the fda approved combination clearances 
no assurances can be given  however  that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for our products  and we expect additional entrants in the generic mfa market in the future 
more than half of our animal health net sales are derived from products sold in the us  and we have a growing presence in europe  mexico  canada  south america and asia 
meridian auto injector segment in the commercial business of our meridian auto injector segment  we compete directly with companies that manufacture drug injection devices  whether such devices are automatic or non automatic  variable dose pen like injection devices  reloadable injection devices or disposable needle free injection systems 
epipen competes with other approved devices which administer epinephrine intramuscularly 
epipen has not experienced a significant decline in market share as new competitors have entered the market 
additional competitors are expected to enter the market in the future 
meridian is the sole supplier of auto injectors to the us government for military use and faces limited competition for auto injector devices in us and approved foreign markets 
research and development branded prescription pharmaceuticals and meridian auto injector segments we are engaged in the development of chemical compounds  including new chemical entities  which provide us with opportunities for the commercialization of new branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
in addition to developing new chemical compounds  we pursue strategies to enhance the value of existing products by developing new uses  formulations  and drug delivery technology that may provide additional benefits to patients and by improving the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing processes 
we invest in research and development because we believe it is important to our long term growth 
we presently employ approximately people in research and development  including pre clinical and toxicology experts  pharmaceutical formulation scientists  clinical development experts  medical affairs personnel  regulatory affairs experts  data scientists statisticians and project managers 
we outsource a substantial portion of our research and development activities 
this approach provides us with substantial operational flexibility while minimizing internal fixed costs 
using this approach  we supplement our internal efforts by collaborating with independent research organizations  including educational institutions and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and contracting with other parties to perform research in their facilities 
we use the services of physicians  hospitals  medical schools  universities  and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of new products 
we seek investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to 
table of contents complement and strengthen our own research efforts 
these investments can take many forms  including in licensing arrangements  development agreements  joint ventures and the acquisition of products in development 
drug development is time consuming and expensive 
only a small percentage of chemical compounds discovered by researchers prove to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine 
the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes to years  or longer 
drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process  and even late stage product candidates frequently fail to receive regulatory approval 
clinical trials are conducted in a series of sequential phases  with each phase designed to address a specific research question 
in phase i clinical trials  researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people to evaluate the drug s safety  determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects 
in phase ii clinical trials  researchers give the drug or treatment to a larger population to assess effectiveness and to further evaluate safety 
in phase iii clinical trials  researchers give the drug or treatment to an even larger population to confirm its effectiveness  monitor side effects  compare it to commonly used treatments and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely 
the results of phase iii clinical trials are pivotal for purposes of obtaining fda approval of a new product 
phase iv clinical trials are typically conducted after fda approval in order to broaden the understanding of the safety and efficacy of a drug as used in actual clinical practice or to explore alternative or additional uses 
our development projects  including those for which we have collaboration agreements with third parties  include the following remoxy  a novel formulation of long acting oxycodone with a proposed indication for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  is specifically designed to resist certain common methods of misuse and abuse associated with long acting oxycodone products that are currently available 
acurox tablets  a patented  orally administered  immediate release tablet containing oxycodone hcl as its sole active analgesic ingredient  has a proposed indication for the relief of moderate to severe pain 
acurox uses acura pharmaceuticals inc s acura patented aversion technology  which is designed to deter misuse and abuse by intentional swallowing of excess quantities of tablets  intravenous injection of dissolved tablets and nasal snorting of crushed tablets 
corvue tm binodenoson is our next generation cardiac pharmacologic stress imaging agent 
vanquix tm  a diazepam filled auto injector with a proposed indication for the treatment of acute  repetitive epileptic seizures  is currently in phase iii clinical trials 
eladur  an investigational transdermal bupivacaine patch for the treatment of pain  is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
oxycodone nt  a novel formulation of long acting oxycodone for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  is currently in early stages of clinical development 
oxycodone nt is specifically designed to resist certain common methods of misuse and abuse associated with long acting oxycodone products that are currently available 
hydrocodone nt  a novel formulation of long acting hydrocodone for treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  is currently in early stages of clinical development 
hydrocodone nt is specifically designed to resist certain common methods of misuse and abuse associated with long acting hydrocodone products that are currently available 
for additional information regarding certain research and development projects  see recent developments in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
animal health segment our animal health business development efforts focus on activities complementary to in licensing and co developing technology through third parties and expanding the geographic reach of our current product line 
table of contents with new registrations in new jurisdictions 
in addition  we conduct technical product development activities at our willow island  west virginia  chicago heights  illinois and bridgewater  new jersey facilities  as well as through contract research organizations and independent research facilities 
we presently employ approximately regulatory and development professionals in our animal health business 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in  excluding research and development in process at the time of acquisition of a product 
these amounts also exclude research and development expenses incurred by alpharma in and since it was not acquired until the end of december in process research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in process research and development represents the actual cost of acquiring rights to branded prescription pharmaceutical projects in development from third parties  which costs were expensed during and at the time of acquisition 
the in process research and development expenses in relate primarily to our acquisition of alpharma on december  intellectual property patents  licenses and proprietary rights the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities is critical to our business 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve legal and factual questions which can be difficult to resolve 
we seek patent protection in the united states and selected foreign countries where and when appropriate 
certain generic companies have challenged patents on skelaxin  avinza and epipen 
please see note  commitments and contingencies in part iv  item a  financial statements for additional information 
skelaxin has three method of use patents listed in the fda s orange book  two of which expire in december and the last of which expires in february on january   the us district court for the eastern district of new york issued an order ruling invalid united states patent nos 
 and  two patents relating to skelaxin  our branded muscle relaxant 
on june   the court entered final judgment against us 
on july   we filed a notice of appeal to the federal circuit  and we filed our appeal brief with the federal circuit on november  we intend to vigorously defend our interests 
in addition  in january  we entered into an agreement with corepharma  llc providing it with a license to launch an authorized generic version of skelaxin in december or earlier under certain conditions 
avinza has a formulation patent listed in the fda s orange book that expires in november flector patch has a formulation patent listed in the fda s orange book that expires in april embeda has several formulation patent applications pending 
we received two notices of allowance from the united states patent and trademark office in pending applications covering the embeda formulation and its method of use in treating pain 
issue fees have been paid and we expect the patents to issue in due course 
once issued  we intend to list these patents in the fda s orange book 
our meridian auto injector segment has a patent covering the next generation auto injector nga for use with epinephrine to be sold under the epipen brand name listed in the fda s orange book that expires in september we receive royalties on sales of adenoscan  a product that we developed 
we have certain rights tied to a patent covering this product which does not expire until in october  we entered into an agreement with astellas and a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva providing teva with the right to launch a generic version of adenoscan pursuant to a license in september  or earlier  under certain conditions 
in addition to the intellectual property for the currently marketed products described above  we also have created  acquired or licensed intellectual property related to various products currently under development 
for 
table of contents example  in connection with our collaborative agreement with pain therapeutics  inc  we have acquired an exclusive license subject to pre existing license rights granted by pain therapeutics to certain intellectual property rights related to opioid formulations  including remoxy  which is currently in development for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain 
in connection with our collaborative agreement with acura  we have acquired a license to intellectual property rights related to the aversion technology platform 
we have exclusive rights to patents related to corvue tm 
we acquired certain intellectual property rights from mutual pharmaceutical company  inc mutual related to metaxalone  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in skelaxin 
as part of our acquisition of alpharma  we have acquired rights to intellectual property related to several products in development 
finally  in connection with a collaboration agreement with durect corporation  we obtained rights to a bupivacaine patch eladur 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and sustain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose the technology or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets 
trademarks we sell our branded products under a variety of trademarks 
we believe that we have valid proprietary interests in all currently used trademarks  including those for our principal branded prescription pharmaceutical and animal health products registered in the united states and selected foreign countries 
government regulation branded prescription pharmaceuticals and meridian auto injector segments our business and our products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation 
pharmaceutical products are subject to pre market approval requirements 
new drugs are approved under  and are subject to  the food  drug and cosmetics act fdc act and related regulations 
biological drugs are subject to both the fdc act and the public health service act  phs act and related regulations 
biological drugs are licensed under the phs act 
at the federal level  we are principally regulated by the fda as well as by the drug enforcement agency dea  a division of the department of justice doj  the consumer product safety commission  the federal trade commission ftc  the occupational safety and health administration  and the us environmental protection agency epa 
the fdc act  the regulations thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
the processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the fda to market and sell a new product are complex  require a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
compounds or potential new products that appear promising in development can prove unsuccessful and fail to receive fda approval  fail to receive approval of specific anticipated indications  be substantially delayed  or receive unfavorable product labeling including limitations on indications or stringent safety warnings  each of which can materially affect the commercial value of the product 
additional factors that may materially affect the success and or timing of regulatory approval of a new product  and its commercial potential  include the regulatory filing strategies employed  the timing of and delays in fda review  and the intervention by third parties in the approval process through administrative or judicial means 
when we acquire the right to market an existing approved branded prescription pharmaceutical product  both we and the former application holder are required to submit certain information to the fda 
this information  if adequate  results in the transfer of marketing rights to us 
we are also required to report to the fda  and sometimes acquire prior approval from the fda for certain changes in an approved nda or biologics licensing application  as set forth in the fda s regulations 
when advantageous  we transfer the manufacture of acquired branded prescription pharmaceutical products to other manufacturing facilities  which 
table of contents may include manufacturing assets we own  after regulatory requirements are satisfied 
in order to transfer manufacturing of acquired products  the prospective new manufacturing facility must demonstrate  through the filing of information with the fda  that it can manufacture the product in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmps and the specifications and conditions of the approved marketing application 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant necessary approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
the fda mandates that drugs be manufactured  packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmps at all times 
in complying with cgmps  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to ensure that the products meet applicable specifications and other requirements to ensure product safety and efficacy 
the fda and other government agencies periodically inspect drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp and other regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  recall of product or seizure of product 
we must report adverse experiences associated with the use of our products by patients to the fda 
the fda could impose market restrictions on us such as labeling changes or product removal as a result of significant reports of unexpected  severe adverse experiences 
product approvals may be withdrawn if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if there are problems with the safety or efficacy of the product 
the federal government has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including the authority to withdraw product approvals at any time  commence actions to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmps  initiate enforcement actions based on promotional materials that are false or misleading  and impose or seek injunctions  voluntary or involuntary recalls  and civil monetary and criminal penalties 
a restriction or prohibition on sales or withdrawal of approval of products marketed by us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain of the branded prescription pharmaceutical products we manufacture and sell are controlled substances as defined in the controlled substances act and related federal and state laws 
these laws establish certain security  licensing  record keeping  reporting and personnel requirements administered by the dea and state authorities 
the dea has dual missions of law enforcement and regulation 
the former deals with the illicit aspects of the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them 
the dea shares enforcement authority with the federal bureau of investigation  another division of the doj 
the dea s regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed manufacturers  distributors and dispensers of controlled substances  the substances themselves and the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent these articles from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce 
we maintain appropriate licenses and certificates with the dea and applicable state authorities in order to engage in the development  manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products containing controlled substances 
the distribution and promotion of pharmaceutical products is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma  a part of the fdc act  which regulates distribution activities at both the federal and state levels 
under the pdma and its implementing regulations  states are permitted to require registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals even if these manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state 
states are also permitted to adopt regulations limiting the distribution of product samples to licensed practitioners  and in several states distributing samples of controlled substances to licensed practitioners is prohibited 
the pdma also imposes extensive licensing  personnel record keeping  packaging  labeling  product handling  storage and security requirements intended to prevent the sale of pharmaceutical product samples or other diversions of samples 
a number of states have passed laws specifically designed to track and regulate specified activities of pharmaceutical companies 
other states and the federal government presently have pending legislation that will have similar effects 
some of these state laws require the tracking and reporting of advertising or marketing activities and spending within the state 
others limit spending on items provided to healthcare providers or state officials 

table of contents animal health segment our animal health business and products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by federal  state  local and foreign agencies 
additionally  our operations are subject to complex federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment and occupational and health safety 
animal drugs must be reviewed by and registered with the fda for marketing in the united states and approved or registered by similar regulatory agencies in other countries  most notably those in canada  the european union eu  asia  mexico and south america 
regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex due to  among other things  the possible impact on humans 
government regulation of our animal health products includes detailed inspections of  and controls over  testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  reporting  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution 
approval also must be granted in the united states for the use of an animal drug in combination with other animal drugs in feeds 
such combination approvals generally require the cooperation of other manufacturers to consent to authorize the fda to refer to such manufacturer s new animal drug application nada in support of our regulatory submissions 
this consent is necessary to obtain approval from the fda for the use of an animal drug in combination with other animal drugs in feeds 
to date  we have been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many products  which extends the reach and potential market share of such products 
manufacturing we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package drug products 
generally  we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials and components from suppliers 
currently  we rely on more than suppliers to deliver the necessary raw materials and components for our products 
branded prescription pharmaceuticals and meridian auto injector segments we manufacture certain of our own branded prescription pharmaceutical products at facilities located in bristol  tennessee  rochester  michigan  middleton  wisconsin  and st 
petersburg  florida 
our meridian auto injector manufacturing facility is located in st 
louis  missouri 
these facilities have manufacturing  packaging  laboratory  office and warehouse space 
we are licensed by the dea to procure and produce controlled substances at our bristol  tennessee facility 
we maintain an operational excellence program utilizing six sigma and lean manufacturing techniques to identify and execute cost saving and process improvement initiatives 
we are capable of producing a broad range of dosage forms  including injectables  tablets and capsules  creams and ointments 
we believe this manufacturing versatility allows us to pursue drug development and product line extensions more efficiently 
however  currently many of our product lines  including embeda skelaxin  thrombin jmi  avinza  and flector patch are manufactured for us by third parties and there is currently no secondary manufacturer with the required regulatory approvals to manufacture these products 
our branded prescription pharmaceutical and meridian auto injector facilities generally operate at moderate capacity utilization rates except for the bristol facility that currently has a low level of capacity utilization 
although the capacity utilization at our bristol facility was lower in and than in previous years  we expect that the capacity utilization at that location will increase in future years 
we are transferring the production of levoxyl from our st 
petersburg facility to our bristol facility 
following the transfer  which we expect to complete in the second half of  we will close our st 
petersburg facility 
in addition  we plan to increase some of the utilization at our bristol facility by manufacturing some of the new products we expect to emerge from our pipeline in the near future 
in addition to manufacturing  we have fully integrated manufacturing support systems  including quality assurance  quality control  regulatory management and logistics 
we believe that these support systems enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products and simultaneously deliver reliable goods to our customers on a timely basis 

table of contents animal health segment we produce our animal health products in several manufacturing facilities  including those located in chicago heights  illinois  which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant  shenzhou  china  yantai  china  longmont  colorado  which produces the majority of our soluble antibiotics and vitamins  willow island  west virginia  which produces chlortetracycline ctc and lasalocid  van buren  arkansas  which blends bio cox  salisbury  maryland  which blends avatec and bovatec  and eagle grove  iowa  which blends aureomycin products 
process improvement and manufacturing development is performed primarily at the chicago heights  willow island and shenzhou facilities 
in addition  we make significant use of third party facilities 
our animal health facilities generally operate at moderate capacity utilization rates except the chicago heights and willow island facilities  which currently have a high level of capacity utilization  and the yantai facility  which currently has a low level of capacity utilization 
environmental matters our operations are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities 
we believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with our permits and environmental laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance were immaterial in and  but may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or as a result of increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report  including our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the adverse events described in this risk factors section or other sections of this report actually occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  the trading price  if any  of our securities could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our businesses the uncertainty and expense of the drug development process  actions by our competitors and regulatory agencies and other factors may adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy to grow our business through increased sales  acquisitions  development and in licensing  and  as a result  our business or competitive position in the pharmaceutical industry may suffer 
drug development is time consuming and expensive 
only a small percentage of chemical compounds discovered by researchers prove to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine 
the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes to years or longer 
drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process  and even late stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval 
clinical trials are conducted in a series of sequential phases  with each phase designed to address a specific research question 
in phase i clinical trials  researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people to evaluate the drug s safety  determine a safe dosage range  and identify side effects 
in phase ii clinical trials  researchers give the drug or treatment to a larger population to assess effectiveness and to further evaluate safety 
in phase iii clinical trials  researchers give the drug or treatment to an even larger population to confirm its effectiveness  monitor side effects  compare it to commonly used treatments  and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely 
the results of phase iii clinical trials are pivotal for purposes of obtaining fda approval of a new product 
the processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the fda to market and sell a new product are complex  require a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
compounds or potential new products that appear promising in development can prove unsuccessful and fail to receive fda approval  fail to receive approval of specific anticipated indications  be substantially delayed  or receive unfavorable product labeling including indications or safety warnings  each of which can materially affect the commercial value of the product 
additional factors that may materially affect the success and or timing of regulatory approval of a new product  and its commercial potential  include the regulatory filing strategies employed  the timing of and delays in fda review  and the intervention by third parties in the approval process through administrative or judicial means 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval of our products in development  or of new dosage forms for existing products  that our products or dosage forms will receive approval for specific indications or that the labeling of these products will be as we would prefer 
our current strategy is to increase sales of certain of our existing products and to enhance our competitive standing through the acquisition or in licensing of products  either in development or previously approved by the fda  that complement our business and allow us to promote and sell new products through existing marketing and distribution channels 
moreover  since we engage in limited proprietary research activity with respect to the development of new chemical entities  we rely heavily on purchasing or licensing products in development and fda approved products from other companies 
branded prescription pharmaceutical development projects  including those for which we have collaboration agreements with third parties  include the following remoxy  a drug for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain that we are developing with pain therapeutics  inc  
table of contents acurox tablets  a drug for the treatment of moderate to severe pain that we are developing with acura  oxycodone nt  a drug for treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  and hydrocodone nt  a drug for treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain 
we compete with other pharmaceutical companies  including large pharmaceutical companies with financial  human and other resources substantially greater than ours  in the development and licensing of new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to engage in product life cycle management to develop new indications and line extensions for existing and acquired products  successfully develop  license or commercialize new products on a timely basis or at all  continue to develop products already in development in a cost effective manner  or obtain any fda approvals necessary to successfully implement the strategies described above 
if we are not successful in the development or licensing of new products already in development  including obtaining any necessary fda approvals  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  since our currently marketed products are generally established and commonly sold  they are subject to competition from products with similar qualities 
for example skelaxin competes in a highly genericized market with other muscle relaxants and could be subject to additional competition from generic products following a court s order ruling invalid two patents related to skelaxin in january altace has multiple generic substitutes that entered the market in december and in sonata competes with other insomnia treatments in a highly competitive market 
a generic substitute entered the market in the second quarter of levoxyl competes in a competitive and highly genericized market with other levothyroxine sodium products 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  thrombin jmi  our bovine thrombin product  faced new competition from human thrombin and recombinant human thrombin 
other of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products also face competition from generic substitutes 
the manufacturers of generic products typically do not bear the related research and development costs and  consequently  are able to offer such products at considerably lower prices than the branded equivalents 
we cannot assure you that any of our products will not face generic competition  or maintain their market share  gross margins and cash flows  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other companies may license or develop products or may acquire technologies for the development of products that are the same as or similar to the products we have in development or that we license 
because there is rapid technological change in the industry and because many other companies may have more financial resources than we do  other companies may develop or license their products more rapidly than we can  complete any applicable regulatory approval process sooner than we can  market or license their products before we can market or license our products  or offer their newly developed or licensed products at prices lower than our prices 

table of contents any of these events would thereby have a negative effect on the sales of our existing  newly developed or licensed products 
the inability to effect acquisitions or licenses of additional branded products in development and fda approved products could limit the overall growth of our business 
furthermore  even if we obtain rights to a pharmaceutical product or acquire a company  we may not be able to generate sales sufficient to create a profit or otherwise avoid a loss 
technological developments or the fda s approval of new products or of new therapeutic indications for existing products may make our existing products or those products we are licensing or developing obsolete or may make them more difficult to market successfully  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
if we cannot successfully defend our rights under the patents relating to our key products  such as skelaxin  or if we are unable to secure or defend our rights under other patents and trademarks and protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property  additional competitors could enter the market  and sales of affected products may decline materially 
under the hatch waxman act  any generic pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an anda with a certification  known as a paragraph iv certification  challenging the validity of or claiming non infringement of a patent listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  which is known as the fda s orange book  four years after the pioneer company obtains approval of its nda 
as more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  financial statements  other companies have filed paragraph iv certifications challenging the patents associated with some of our key products 
for example  in january  a us district court ruled invalid two key patents related to skelaxin based on paragraph iv challenges 
we have appealed the judgment  but the appeal may be unsuccessful 
if any of these paragraph iv challenges succeeds  our affected product would face generic competition and its sales would likely decline materially 
should sales decline  we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with the affected product 
we may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products we currently market or for products and technologies we develop or license 
in addition  our competitors may develop products similar to ours  including generic products  using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property protection 
the appearance in the market of products developed in this way could materially reduce our sales 
there is no proprietary protection for many of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products  and generic substitutes for many of these products are sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
further  we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation in order to maintain our competitive position with respect to some products 
our sales could be materially reduced if our competitors independently develop equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or gain access to our trade secrets  know how and technology 
if we are unable to defend our patents and trademarks or protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  we have inventory purchase commitments related to purchase orders and certain supply agreements which contain minimum purchase commitments 
if loss of market exclusivity or other factors cause sales of our products to fall below amounts necessary to use the inventory we have committed to purchase  we may incur losses in connection with those supply agreements or purchase orders 
an expansion of restrictions on  or bans of  the use of antibiotics used in food producing animals could result in a decrease in our sales 
the issue of the potential transfer of increased bacterial resistance to human pathogens due to the use of certain antibiotics in certain food producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and  in certain instances  has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food producing animals 
the sales of our animal health segment are principally antibiotic based products for use with food producing animals  therefore  future limitations in major markets  including the us  or negative publicity regarding this 
table of contents use of antibiotic based products  could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that we offer for sale  the eu and a number of non eu countries  including norway and turkey  banned the use of zinc bacitracin  a feed antibiotic growth promoter manufactured by us and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over years 
we have not sold this product as a feed additive growth promoter in these countries since the bans took effect initially in the eu in july  in turkey  bulgaria and romania the latter two now part of the eu in  and in norway in january 
the eu ban is based upon the precautionary principle  which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty 
taiwan  south korea and brazil have implemented  or are expected to implement shortly  restrictions on the use of antibiotics in animal feed 
we have marketed antibiotics for use in food producing animals in these countries but will be required to curtail or discontinue those practices 
the actions by these countries may negatively impact our business as a result of reduced sales 
it is not yet known whether this reduction will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
discussions of the antibiotic resistance issue continue actively in the us various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse human effects from the use of antibiotics in food animals 
some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers  some of whom are our customers or the end users of our products  are reducing the use of antibiotics 
in july  fda officials expressed support for a phase out of growth promotion feed efficiency uses of antibiotics in food producing animals 
legislation pending before congress would  if it were to become law  require the fda to withdraw the approval of such nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics unless the fda determines  within two years of enactment  that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to human health due to the development of antimicrobial resistance that is attributable in whole or in part to the nontherapeutic use of the drug in food producing animals 
under the proposed legislation  this finding may be based on evidence submitted by the holder of the approved product application or developed by the fda on its own initiative 
we cannot predict whether this legislation will become law or  if it does  whether the fda would agree that this standard has been satisfied for bacitracin based products 
in july  the fda withdrew the approval of an antibiotic poultry water medication due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance in humans 
while we do not market this drug  this ruling could be significant if its conclusions were expanded to the mfas sold by us 
in the absence of new legislation  it is uncertain what additional actions  if any  the fda may take for approved animal drug products 
however  the fda has established guidance for the industry on how to prepare assessments comparing the risks associated with the use of specific antibiotic products in food producing animals  including those sold by us 
while we do not believe that the current guidance would have a materially adverse effect on our business  it is subject to change 
we cannot predict whether the present ban of zinc bacitracin products may be expanded or whether other antibiotic restrictions will be introduced 
if any one of the following events occurs  the resulting loss of sales could be material to our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations additional countries  such as the us  where we have material sales of bacitracin based products  restrict or ban the use of zinc bacitracin or other antibiotic feed additives  countries which are significant importers of meat act to prevent the importation of products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin based or other antibiotic containing products  there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives  or consumers or retailers decide to purchase fewer meat products from animals fed antibiotics 

table of contents potential adverse effects on human health linked to the raising or consumption of food producing animals using our products could result in a decrease in our sales 
should the government find  or the public perceive  a risk to human health from consumption of food producing animals which utilize our products such as avian flu or as a by product to the raising of such animals  such as the chicken litter litigation  there may be a decline in either the sale of these food products  which would result in a decrease in the use of our products  or a decrease in the use of our products in the growing of these food producing animals 
for additional information regarding the chicken litter litigation  please see note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  financial statements 
unfavorable results in pending and future claims and litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are named as a party in various lawsuits 
for information about our pending material litigation matters  please see note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  financial statements 
while we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions  we are generally unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any  in the pending litigation 
if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  we could be required to pay material sums in connection with judgments or settlements related to these matters  or the pending litigation could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we cannot integrate the business of companies or products we acquire  or appropriately and successfully manage and coordinate third party collaborative development activities  our business may suffer 
the integration into our business of in licensed or acquired assets or businesses  as well as the coordination and collaboration of research and development  sales and marketing efforts with third parties  requires significant management attention  maintenance of adequate operational  financial and management information systems  integration of systems that we acquire into our existing systems  and verification that the acquired processes and systems meet applicable standards for internal control over financial reporting 
our future results will also depend in part on our ability to hire  retain and motivate qualified employees to manage expanded operations efficiently in accordance with applicable regulatory standards 
if we cannot manage our third party collaborations and integrate in licensed and acquired assets successfully  or  if we do not establish and maintain appropriate processes in support of these activities  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and on our ability to make the necessary certifications with respect to our internal controls 
the terms of our revolving credit facility restricts  and other borrowing arrangements in the future could similarly restrict  our activities in various ways 
the senior secured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that  among other things  restrict additional indebtedness  liens and encumbrances  sale and leaseback transactions  loans and investments  acquisitions and purchases  dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  asset dispositions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments  redemptions and repurchases of other indebtedness and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the revolving credit facility also contains customary events of default  including  without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to certain other material indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  certain erisa events  judgments in excess of specified amounts  certain impairments to the guarantees  and change in control 
the breach of any covenants or obligations under the revolving credit facility could result in a default which could trigger acceleration of or the right to accelerate the related debt 
in addition  our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
if any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated  it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business or we may be unable to repay such debt  and  therefore  such acceleration could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and  consequently  the price of our common stock 

table of contents we may enter into other borrowing arrangements in the future which impose restrictions on us similar to  or more restrictive than  the terms of the revolving credit facility 
for more information about the terms of the revolving credit facility  please see note  long term debt  in part iv  item a  financial statements 
any significant delays or difficulties in the manufacture of  or supply of materials for  our products may reduce our profit margins and revenues  limit the sales of our products  or harm our products reputations 
many of our products  including embeda  skelaxin  the flector patch  thrombin jmi  avinza and certain animal health products and ingredients  are currently manufactured in part or entirely by third parties 
in addition  many of these products are produced by manufacturers for which there is no secondary manufacturer with the required regulatory approvals 
our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of certain products may adversely affect our profit margins or may result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control 
for example  if any of these third parties is not in compliance with applicable regulations  the manufacture of our products could be delayed  halted or otherwise adversely affected 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute our products as planned 
further  if we encounter other delays or difficulties in producing or packaging products either handled by third parties or by us  the distribution  marketing and subsequent sales of these products could be adversely affected  and we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or abandon product lines or sell them on unsatisfactory terms 
we might not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements in a timely manner or at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
we also cannot assure you that third party manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 
future growth rates and success of our animal health and auto injector businesses depend in part on continued growth in our operations outside of the united states 
in the case of animal health  we have both sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states and numerous risks and uncertainties affect those operations 
these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability  changes in local governmental laws  regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs  investments  taxation  employment regulations  repatriation of earnings  enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions 
international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs  including risks of non compliance with us and local laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  the us arms export control act and the international traffic in arms regulations 
while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict  any of them could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
if we were to violate us or local laws  we may be subject to fines  penalties  other costs  loss of ability to do business with the us government or other business related effects which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are required annually  or on an interim basis as needed  to review the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment 
if sales of our products decline because of  for example  generic competition or an inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient supply of product  the intangible asset value of any declining product could become impaired  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately billion of net intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets primarily include the net book value of various product rights  trademarks  patents and other intangible rights 
if a change in circumstances causes us to lower our future sales forecast for a product  we 
table of contents may be required to write off a portion of the net book value of the intangible assets associated with that product 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
in the event the value of an individual business reporting unit declines significantly  it could result in a non cash impairment charge 
any impairment of the net book value of any intangible asset or goodwill  depending on the size  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into agreements with manufacturers and or distributors of generic pharmaceutical products with whom we are presently engaged  or have previously been engaged  in litigation  and these agreements could subject us to claims that we have violated federal and or state anti trust laws 
we have negotiated and entered into a number of agreements with manufacturers and or distributors of generic pharmaceutical products  some of whom are presently engaged or have previously been engaged in litigation with us 
governmental and or private parties may allege that these arrangements and activities in furtherance of the success of these arrangements violate applicable federal or state anti trust laws 
alternatively  courts could interpret these laws in a manner contrary to current understandings of and past rulings relating to such laws 
if a court or other governmental body were to conclude that a violation of these laws had occurred  any liability based on such a finding could be materially adverse and could be preceded or followed by private litigation such as class action litigation 
for example  we have received civil investigative demands cids for information from the ftc 
the cids require us to provide information related to our collaboration with arrow  the dismissal without prejudice of our patent infringement litigation against cobalt under the hatch waxman act of and other information 
we are cooperating with the ftc in this investigation 
sales of thrombin jmi may be affected by the perception of risks associated with some of the raw materials used in its manufacture 
if we are unable to maintain purification procedures at our facilities that are in accordance with the fda s expectations for biological products generally  the fda could limit our ability to manufacture biological products at those facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for the year ended december   our product thrombin jmi accounted for of our total revenues 
the source material for thrombin jmi comes from bovine plasma and lung tissue which has been certified by the united states department of agriculture for use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
bovine sourced materials  particularly those from outside the united states  may be of some concern because of potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or bse 
however  we have taken precautions to minimize the risks of contamination from bse in our source materials and process 
our principal precaution is the use of bovine materials only from fda approved sources in the united states 
accordingly  all source animals used in our production of thrombin jmi are of united states origin 
additionally  source animals used in production of thrombin jmi are generally less than months of age bse has not been identified in animals less than months of age 
there is currently no alternative to the bovine sourced materials for the manufacture of thrombin jmi 
we have two approved vendors as sources of supply of the bovine raw materials 
any interruption or delay in the supply of these materials could adversely affect the sales of thrombin jmi 
we will continue surveillance of the source and believe that the risk of bse contamination in the source materials for thrombin jmi is very low 
while we believe that our procedures and those of our vendor for the supply  testing and handling of the bovine material comply with all federal  state  and local regulations  we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials 
there are high levels of global public concern about bse 
physicians could determine not to administer thrombin jmi because of the perceived risk  which could adversely affect our sales of the product 
any injuries resulting from bse contamination could expose us to extensive liability 
if public concern about the risk of bse infection in the united states should increase  the manufacture and sale of thrombin jmi and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the fda expects manufacturers of biological products to have validated processes capable of removing extraneous viral contaminants to a high level of assurance 
we have developed and implemented appropriate processing steps to achieve maximum assurance that potential extraneous viral contaminants are removed from thrombin jmi  which does not include bse because it is not a viral contaminant  and we gained fda approval for these processes 
if we are unable to successfully maintain these processing steps or obtain the necessary supplies to do so in accordance with the fda s expectations  the manufacture and sale of thrombin jmi and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our charter and bylaws and applicable state laws discourage unsolicited takeover proposals and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors  and special voting requirements for the amendment of our charter and bylaws 
we are also subject to anti takeover provisions under tennessee law  each of which could delay or prevent a change of control 
together  these provisions may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 
at times  our stock price has been volatile  and such volatility in the future could result in substantial losses for our investors 
the trading price of our common stock has at times been volatile 
the stock market in general and the market for the securities of emerging pharmaceutical companies such as king  in particular  have experienced extreme volatility 
many factors contribute to this volatility  including variations in our results of operations  perceived risks and uncertainties concerning our business  announcements of earnings  the commencement of  or adverse developments in  any material litigation or governmental investigation  failure to meet timelines for product development or other projections or forward looking statements we may make to the public  failure to meet or exceed security analysts financial projections for our company  comments or recommendations made by securities analysts  general market conditions  perceptions about market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry  announcements of technological innovations or the results of clinical trials or studies  changes in marketing  product pricing and sales strategies or development of new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  and announcements concerning regulatory compliance and government agency reviews 
the volatility of our common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on our shareholders than would a less volatile stock 
in addition  such volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a shareholder s holdings of our common stock 

table of contents compliance with the terms and conditions of our corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services requires significant resources and management time and  if we fail to comply  we could be subject to penalties or  under certain circumstances  excluded from government health care programs  which could materially reduce our sales 
in october  as part of our settlement of a government pricing investigation of our company  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs oig 
for additional information  please see note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  financial statements 
the purpose of the cia  which applies to all of our us subsidiaries and employees  is to promote compliance with the federal health care and procurement programs in which we participate  including the medicaid drug rebate program  the medicare program  the b drug pricing program  and the veterans administration pricing program 
in addition to the challenges associated with complying with the regulations applicable to each of these programs as discussed below  we are required  among other things  to keep in place our current corporate compliance program  provide specified training to employees  retain an independent review organization to conduct periodic audits of our medicaid rebate calculations and our automated systems  processes  policies and practices related to government pricing calculations  and to provide periodic reports to hhs oig 
maintaining the broad array of processes  policies and procedures necessary to comply with the cia is expected to continue to require a significant portion of management s attention as well as the application of significant resources 
failing to meet the cia obligations could have serious consequences for us including stipulated monetary penalties for each instance of noncompliance 
in addition  flagrant or repeated violations of the cia could result in our being excluded from participating in government health care programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our industries new legislation or regulatory proposals may adversely affect our revenues  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been proposed and could be proposed in the future that are broadly aimed at health care reform 
such reform could involve easing safeguards that limit importation and reimportation of prescription products from countries outside the united states  providing preferential treatment to manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products  imposing additional and possibly conflicting reporting requirements on prescription pharmaceutical companies  reducing the level at which pharmaceutical companies are reimbursed for sales of their products  altering the requirements applicable to health care insurance  and requiring significant monitoring initiatives by manufacturers in an attempt to reduce the misuse and abuse of controlled substances 
while we cannot predict when or whether any of these proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals may have on our business  these and other similar proposals may exacerbate industry wide pricing pressures and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
failure to comply with laws and government regulations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
virtually all of our activities are regulated by us federal and state statutes and government agencies as well as laws and agencies in foreign countries 
the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  distribution and marketing of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from these activities  are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the fda  the dea  the ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the department of agriculture  the occupational safety and health 
table of contents administration  and the epa  as well as by foreign governments in countries where we manufacture or distribute products 
failure to comply with the policies or requirements established by these agencies could subject us to enforcement actions or other consequences 
for example  noncompliance with applicable fda policies or requirements could subject us to suspensions of manufacturing or distribution  seizure of products  product recalls  fines  criminal penalties  injunctions  failure to approve pending drug product applications or withdrawal of product marketing approvals 
similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies  such as the dea  the epa or various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are manufactured  sold or distributed  and could have ramifications for our contracts with government agencies  such as the department of veterans affairs or the dod 
the fda has the authority and discretion to withdraw existing marketing approvals and to review the regulatory status of marketed products at any time 
for example  the fda may require withdrawal of an approved marketing application for any drug product marketed if new information reveals problems with a drug s safety or efficacy 
all drugs must be manufactured in conformity with cgmps and drug products subject to an approved application must be manufactured  processed  packaged  held and labeled in accordance with information contained in the approved application 
while we believe that all of our currently marketed pharmaceutical products comply with fda enforcement policies  have approval pending or have received the requisite agency approvals  our marketing is subject to challenge by the fda at any time 
through various enforcement mechanisms  the fda can ensure that noncomplying drugs are no longer marketed and that advertising and marketing materials and campaigns are in compliance with fda regulations 
in addition  modifications  enhancements  or changes in manufacturing sites of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be received and which may be subject to a lengthy fda review process 
our manufacturing facilities and those of our third party manufacturers are continually subject to inspection by governmental agencies 
manufacturing operations could be interrupted or halted in any of those facilities if a government or regulatory authority is unsatisfied with the results of an inspection 
any interruptions of this type could result in materially reduced sales of our products or increased manufacturing costs 
for additional information please see the section entitled government regulation in item  business  in part i 
medicaid reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and in certain respects ambiguous 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  we could be subject to additional reimbursements  penalties  sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our processes for estimating amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs involve subjective decisions  and  as a result  these calculations will remain subject to the risk of errors 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  cercla  the epa can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of contaminated properties upon each or any of the current and former site owners  site operators or parties who sent waste to the site  regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity 
in addition  many states  including tennessee  michigan  wisconsin  florida and missouri  have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the epa 
we have entered into hazardous waste hauling agreements with licensed third parties to properly dispose of hazardous wastes 
we cannot assure you that we will not be found liable under cercla or other applicable state statutes or regulations for the costs of undertaking a cleanup at a site to which our wastes were transported 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive  or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to include  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
the federal government has published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain payment arrangements that do not violate the anti kickback statutes 
we seek to comply with these safe harbors 
due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our 
table of contents practices  it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti kickback or similar laws 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly in the civil context  or knowingly and willfully in the criminal context  presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors including medicaid and medicare claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil and or criminal sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs  including medicaid and medicare 
we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations  enforcement positions  statutes or legal interpretations  when and if promulgated  adopted or enacted  may have on our business in the future 
these changes could  among other things  require modifications to our manufacturing methods or facilities  expanded or different labeling  new approvals  the recall  replacement or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
these changes  new legislation  or failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
any reduction in reimbursement levels by managed care organizations or other third party payors may have an adverse effect on our revenues 
commercial success in producing  marketing and selling branded prescription pharmaceutical products depends  in part  on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party healthcare payors  such as the government  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging whether to reimburse certain pharmaceutical products and medical services 
for example  many managed healthcare organizations limit reimbursement of pharmaceutical products 
these limits may take the form of formularies with differential co pay tiers 
the resulting competition among pharmaceutical companies to maximize their product reimbursement has generally reduced growth in average selling prices across the industry 
we cannot assure you that our products will be appropriately reimbursed or included on the formulary lists of managed care organizations or any or all medicare part d plans  or that downward pricing pressures in the industry generally will not negatively impact our operations 
we establish accruals for the estimated amounts of rebates we will pay to managed care and government organizations each quarter 
any increased usage of our products through medicaid  medicare  or managed care programs will increase the amount of rebates that we owe 
we cannot assure you that our products will be included on the formulary lists of managed care or medicare organizations or that adverse reimbursement issues will not result in materially lower revenues 
wholesaler and distributor buying patterns and other factors may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate  and these fluctuations may adversely affect our short term results 
further  our access to wholesaler and distributor inventory levels and sales data affects our ability to estimate certain reserves included in our financial statements 
our results of operations  including  in particular  product sales revenue  may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors 
sales to wholesalers and distributors represent a substantial majority of our total sales 
buying patterns of our wholesalers and distributors may vary from time to time 
in the event wholesalers and distributors with whom we do business determine to limit their purchases of our products  sales of our products could be adversely affected 
for example  in advance of an anticipated price increase  customers may order branded prescription pharmaceutical products in larger than normal quantities 
the ordering of excess quantities in any quarter could cause sales of some of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products to be lower in subsequent quarters than they would have been otherwise 
we have inventory management and data services agreements with each of the three key branded prescription pharmaceutical products wholesale customers and other wholesale customers who purchase our branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
these agreements provide wholesalers incentives to manage inventory levels and provide timely and accurate data with respect to inventory levels held  and valuable data regarding sales and marketplace activity 
we rely 
table of contents on the timeliness and accuracy of the data that each customer provides to us on a regular basis pursuant to these agreements 
if our wholesalers fail to provide us with timely and accurate data in accordance with the agreements  our estimates for certain reserves included in our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
other factors that may affect quarterly results include  but are not limited to  expenditures related to the acquisition  sale and promotion of pharmaceutical products  a changing customer base  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  new products introduced by us or our competitors  the mix of products we sell  interruptions in our internal manufacturing processes  product recalls  competitive pricing pressures and general economic and industry conditions that may affect customer demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
an increase in product liability claims or product recalls could harm our business and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our technologies or products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
these risks exist for products in clinical development and with respect to products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while we have taken  and will continue to take  what we believe are appropriate precautions  we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
we currently have product liability insurance covering all of our significant products  but we cannot assure you that the level or breadth of any insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover fully all potential claims 
also  adequate insurance coverage might not be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all 
with respect to any product liability claims that are not covered by insurance  we could be responsible for any monetary damages awarded by any court or any voluntary monetary settlements 
significant judgments against us for product liability for which we have no insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
product recalls or product field alerts may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of the fda  other government agencies or other companies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical product sales 
from time to time  we may recall products for various reasons  including failure of our products to maintain their stability through their expiration dates 
any recall or product field alert has the potential of damaging the reputation of the product or our reputation 
to date  these recalls have not been significant and have not had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that the number and significance of recalls will not increase in the future 
any significant recalls could materially affect our sales and the prescription trends for the products and damage the reputation of the products or our reputation 
in these cases  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials may adversely affect the sales of our products or the values of the intangible assets associated with them 
from time to time  studies or clinical trials on various aspects of pharmaceutical products are conducted by academics or others  including government agencies  the results of which  when published  may have dramatic effects on the markets for the pharmaceutical products that are the subject of the study  or those of related or similar products 
the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials related to our products or the therapeutic areas in which our products compete could adversely affect our sales  the prescription trends for our products and the reputation of our products 
in the event of the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials related to our branded prescription pharmaceutical products or the therapeutic areas in which our products compete  sales of these products may be materially adversely affected 
the insolvency of  or decreased purchasing by  any of our principal customers  who are wholesale pharmaceutical distributors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as with most other pharmaceutical companies  the primary customers for our branded prescription pharmaceutical products are wholesale pharmaceutical distributors 
the wholesale distributor network for 
table of contents pharmaceutical products has in recent years been subject to increasing consolidation  which has increased our  and other industry participants  customer concentration 
accordingly  three key customers accounted for approximately of our gross sales and a significant portion of our accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended december  the insolvency of or decreased purchasing by any of our principal customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

recent developments embeda in august  the fda approved embeda morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules  a long acting schedule ii opioid analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous  around the clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time 
embeda contains pellets of an extended release oral formulation of morphine sulfate  an opioid receptor agonist  surrounding an inner core of naltrexone hydrochloride  an opioid receptor antagonist 
when embeda is used as directed  the inner core of naltrexone remains sequestered and passes through the body without any clinical effect 
when embeda is tampered by crushing or chewing  the naltrexone is released and can antagonize the effects of the morphine 
embeda is the first fda approved long acting opioid designed to reduce drug liking and euphoria when tampered with by crushing or chewing 
however  the clinical significance of the degree of reduction in drug liking and euphoria reported in clinical studies has not yet been established 
there is no evidence that the naltrexone in embeda reduces the abuse liability of embeda 
embeda became commercially available in late september on october   we received a warning letter from the fda  division of drug marketing  advertising  and communications ddmac regarding certain materials used to announce the commercial launch of embeda 
the letter indicated these materials were false or misleading because they omitted and minimized the risks associated with the use of embeda  failed to present the limitations to its approved indication  and presented misleading claims 
we ceased the dissemination of these materials and took steps to conform other materials we currently utilize with embeda to the guidance set forth in the warning letter 
on october   we responded to the warning letter  providing ddmac with a list of materials that were discontinued and a comprehensive plan of action to appropriately disseminate corrective messages to those that received the original materials 
we continue to cooperate fully with ddmac in this matter 
we met with members of the fda on december  to discuss the warning letter 
during january we submitted to ddmac for pre approval proposed revised marketing materials  as well as certain corrective materials 
remoxy in early july  we met with the fda to discuss the complete response letter received by us in december regarding our new drug application nda for remoxy 
the outcome of this meeting provided us with a clearer path forward to resubmit the remoxy nda and to address all fda comments in the complete response letter 
we believe the timing of the resubmission will be determined principally by the generation of six month stability data 
we are not required by the fda to conduct clinical trials in order to provide additional safety or efficacy data in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain 
as part of the resubmission plan  and in order to strengthen the nda  we have undertaken a likeability study and a pharmacokinetic trial in volunteers 
we plan to resubmit the nda in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents remoxy is a unique long acting formulation of oral oxycodone with a proposed indication for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous  around the clock  opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time 
this formulation uses the oradur tm platform technology  which provides a unique physical barrier that is designed to provide controlled pain relief and at the same time resist certain common methods used to extract the opioid more rapidly than intended as can occur with products currently on the market that are abused in this way for non medical purposes 
common methods used to cause a rapid extraction of an opioid include crushing  chewing and dissolution in alcohol 
these methods are typically used to cause failure of the controlled release dosage form  resulting in dose dumping of oxycodone  or the immediate release of the active drug so as to achieve a state of euphoria 
acurox tablets on june   the fda issued a complete response letter regarding the nda for acurox tablets 
the complete response letter raises issues regarding the potential abuse deterrent benefits of acurox 
in early september  we and acura pharmaceuticals  inc acura met with the fda to discuss the complete response letter 
the fda  acura and we agreed to submit the nda to an fda advisory committee to consider the evidence to support the potential abuse deterrent effects of acurox tablets when compared to other currently marketed short acting oxycodone opioid products 
while the fda indicated that no new clinical trials are required at this time  we and acura are conducting an additional clinical study in volunteers to further assess the abuse deterrent features of acurox 
the fda has set a meeting date for the advisory committee s review of the nda in the second quarter of acurox tablets  a patented  orally administered  immediate release tablet containing oxycodone hcl as its sole active analgesic ingredient  has a proposed indication for the relief of moderate to severe pain 
acurox uses acura s patented aversion technology  which is designed to deter misuse and abuse by intentional swallowing of excess quantities of tablets  intravenous injection of dissolved tablets and nasal snorting of crushed tablets 
attempts to extract oxycodone from an acurox tablet by dissolving it in liquid result in the formation of a viscous gel which is intended to limit the ability to inject the drug intravenously 
crushing an acurox tablet for the purposes of nasal snorting releases an ingredient that is intended to cause nasal irritation and thereby discourage this method of misuse and abuse 
swallowing excessive numbers of acurox tablets releases niacin in quantities that are intended to cause unpleasant and undesirable side effects 
corvue tm binodenoson for injection in december  we submitted an nda for corvue tm to the fda 
on october   we received a complete response letter from the fda with respect to the nda for corvue tm 
we are currently working on our reply to the fda s complete response letter 
corvue tm is a cardiac pharmacologic stress agent for use as an adjunct in spect single photon emission computed tomographic cardiac imaging intended for use in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease who are unable to perform a cardiac exercise stress test 
department of justice investigation as previously disclosed  alpharma  acquired by us in december  received a subpoena from department of justice doj in february in connection with its investigation of alleged improper sales and marketing practices related to the sale of the pain medicine kadian 
we divested alpharma s kadian assets to actavis llc simultaneously with the closing of the acquisition of alpharma 
in september  we reached an agreement in principle with the us attorney s office and doj which would  if completed  resolve this investigation 
we recorded a reserve of million in connection with this development in the third quarter of as an adjustment to the goodwill associated with the purchase of alpharma because evaluation of the doj investigation and the allocation period associated with this preacquisition contingency was still in progress through that time 
final agreement is subject to the execution of a definitive settlement agreement 

table of contents operating results the following table summarizes total revenues and cost of revenues by operating segment for the years ended december  in thousands total revenues branded prescription pharmaceuticals animal health meridian auto injector royalties and other total revenues cost of revenues  exclusive of depreciation  amortization and impairments branded prescription pharmaceuticals animal health meridian auto injector royalties and other total cost of revenues the following table summarizes our deductions from gross revenues 
for the years ended december  in thousands gross revenues commercial rebates medicare part d rebates medicaid rebates chargebacks returns trade discounts other discontinued operations net revenues gross revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to additional sales from alpharma  which we acquired at the end of december  gross revenues of embeda  which we began selling in late september after the product received fda approval in august  and an increase in revenues in the meridian auto injector segment 
gross revenues of several key branded prescription pharmaceuticals products decreased due to market competition  as discussed below 
we anticipate gross revenues in will be similar to those in gross revenues were lower in compared to primarily due to a decrease in gross revenues of altace  partially offset by increases in gross revenues of avinza  which we acquired on february   and the meridian auto injector segment 
during december  a competitor entered the market with a generic substitute for altace and additional generic competitors entered the market in june we maintain inventory management and data services agreements imas with each of our three key branded prescription wholesale customers and other wholesale customers 
these agreements provide wholesalers incentives to manage inventory levels and provide timely and accurate data with respect to inventory levels held  and valuable data regarding sales and marketplace activity 
we rely on the timeliness and accuracy of the 
table of contents data that each customer provides to us on a regular basis pursuant to these agreements 
if our wholesalers fail to provide us with timely and accurate data in accordance with the agreements  our estimates for certain reserves included in our financial statements could be materially affected 
based on inventory data provided by our key customers under the imas  we believe that wholesale inventory levels of skelaxin  thrombin jmi  flector patch  avinza  and levoxyl  as of december   are at or below levels we consider normal 
we estimate that the wholesale and retail inventories of all our products as of december  represent gross revenues of approximately million to million 
the following tables provide the activity and ending balances for our significant deductions from gross sales accrual for rebates  including administrative fees in thousands balance at january  net of prepaid amounts current provision related to sales made in current period current benefit provision related to sales made in prior periods rebates paid alpharma acquisition balance at december  net of prepaid amounts rebates include commercial rebates and medicaid and medicare rebates 
during the first quarter of  we delayed our regular periodic medicaid rebate payments as a result of prior overpayments 
during the second quarter of  we began reducing our payments for medicaid rebates to use these overpayments 
during the third quarter of  we began reporting to the centers for medicare and medicaid services using a refined calculation to compute our average manufacturer s price amp and best price 
as a result of refining the amp and best price calculations in the third quarter of  we discontinued the practice of making payments in excess of the amounts expensed 
we expect to recover the remaining overpayments to the government and will continue to reduce cash payments in the future until this overpayment is fully recovered 
in  and  the utilization of overpayments reduced our rebate payments by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the utilization of the overpayment has therefore reduced rebates paid in the table above 
a competitor entered the market with a generic substitute for altace during december and additional competitors entered the market in june as a result of this competition  sales of altace and use of altace by rebate eligible customers decreased in and the decrease in use of altace by rebate eligible customers has  in turn  significantly decreased the current provision related to sales made in the current period and rebates paid in the table above 
for a discussion regarding altace net sales  please see altace within the sales of key products section below 
accrual for returns in thousands balance at january current provision actual returns alpharma acquisition ending balance at december 
table of contents our calculation for product return reserves is based on historical sales and return rates over the period during which customers have a right of return 
we also consider current wholesale and retail inventory levels of our products 
because actual returns related to sales in prior periods were lower than our original estimates  we recorded a decrease in our reserve for returns in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded prescription pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
the effect of the change in estimate on first quarter operating income was an increase of approximately million 
the accrual for returns table above reflects this adjustment as a reduction in the current provision 
accrual for chargebacks in thousands balance at january current provision actual chargebacks alpharma acquisition ending balance at december branded prescription pharmaceuticals segment change for the years ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands branded prescription pharmaceuticals revenue skelaxin thrombin jmi flector patch avinza embeda levoxyl altace other total revenue cost of revenues  exclusive of depreciation  amortization and impairments net sales from branded prescription pharmaceutical products were lower in than in primarily due to lower net sales of altace  thrombin jmi and skelaxin  discussed below  partially offset by sales of flector patch and embeda 
flector patch was part of the acquisition of alpharma at the end of embeda was approved by the fda in august  and we began selling the product in late september we expect net sales from branded prescription pharmaceutical products to decrease in from levels primarily due to anticipated decreases in sales of several of our key products  discussed below  partially offset by an anticipated increase in net sales of embeda and flector patch 

table of contents net sales from branded prescription pharmaceutical products were lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in net sales of altace  partially offset by increases in net sales of avinza  which we acquired on february  during december  a competitor entered the market with a generic substitute for altace and additional competitors entered the market in june for a discussion regarding the potential risk of generic competition for skelaxin and avinza  please see note  commitments and contingencies in part iv  item a  financial statements 
sales of key products skelaxin on january   the us district court for the eastern district of new york issued an order ruling invalid two patents related to skelaxin 
in june  the court entered judgment against king 
we have appealed the judgment and plan to vigorously defend our interests 
the entry of the court s order may lead to generic versions of skelaxin entering the market sooner than previously anticipated  which would likely cause net sales of skelaxin to decline significantly 
net sales of skelaxin decreased in from primarily due to a decrease in prescriptions  partially offset by price increases taken in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of primarily due to a decrease in promotional efforts  total prescriptions for skelaxin decreased approximately in from  according to ims america  ltd 
ims monthly prescription data 
following the january court order  we completed a restructuring initiative that reduced our promotional efforts 
for additional information regarding the restructuring initiative  please see skelaxin within the liquidity and capital resources section below 
we expect net sales of skelaxin will continue to decrease during as a result of the decrease in promotional efforts 
we anticipate significant decreases in net sales if generic competition enters the market 
net sales of skelaxin increased in from primarily due to a price increase taken in the fourth quarter of and decreases in wholesale inventory levels during  partially offset by a decrease in prescriptions 
during  net sales of skelaxin benefited from a favorable change in estimate during the first quarter of in the product s reserve for returns as discussed above 
due to increased competition  total prescriptions for skelaxin decreased approximately in compared to according to ims monthly prescription data 
in january  we entered into an agreement with corepharma  llc corepharma granting corepharma a license to launch an authorized generic version of skelaxin in december  or earlier under certain conditions 
for a discussion regarding the risk of potential generic competition for skelaxin  please see note  commitments and contingencies in part iv  item a  financial statements 
thrombin jmi net sales of thrombin jmi decreased in compared to and in compared to primarily due to price concessions and the market entry of two competing products which caused a decrease in gross sales 
the first competing product entered the market in the fourth quarter of and another entered the market in the first quarter of we expect net sales of our thrombin jmi product to decrease in as a result of competition 
flector patch flector patch was part of the acquisition of alpharma at the end of december alpharma began selling flector patch in january total prescriptions for flector patch increased approximately in compared to the launch year of  according to ims monthly prescription data 
we anticipate prescriptions to increase in from  however  we do not believe prescriptions will increase at the rate experienced in at the time of acquisition  the wholesale inventory level of flector patch exceeded our 
table of contents normal levels 
during the first quarter of  we reduced these inventories to a level consistent with our other promoted products 
as a result  net sales of flector patch were lower than prescription demand in avinza net sales of avinza decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in prescriptions  partially offset by price increases taken in the first and fourth quarters of total prescriptions for avinza decreased approximately in compared to according to ims monthly prescription data 
we expect net sales of avinza to decrease at a higher rate in than in net sales of avinza increased in compared to primarily due to a price increase taken in the fourth quarter of  an increase in prescriptions and the fact that net sales of avinza in only reflect sales occurring from february  through december  we acquired all rights to avinza in the united states  its territories and canada on february  total prescriptions for avinza increased approximately in compared to according to ims monthly prescription data 
on march   we received a letter from ddmac regarding promotional material for avinza that was created and submitted to the ddmac by ligand pharmaceuticals incorporated ligand the company from which we acquired avinza in late february 
the letter expressed concern with the balance of the described risks and benefits associated with the use of the product and the justification for certain statements made in the promotional material 
we had already discontinued the use of promotional materials created by ligand prior to receiving the letter and communicated this information to ddmac 
in addition  ddmac requested support for certain statements included in avinza promotional materials which were then in use 
we promptly responded to this request and asked for a meeting with ddmac to discuss this matter 
our request resulted in a teleconference with ddmac representatives on january  after this call  we immediately ceased the dissemination of promotional materials for avinza that included any statements with which ddmac took issue in its march  letter 
further  we directed our sales representatives to discontinue the use of such materials and ceased all advertising containing the statements discussed in that letter

the tax exempt auction rate securities that we hold are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are intended to reset through an auction process generally every seven  or days 
our investment policy requires us to maintain an investment portfolio with a high credit quality 
accordingly  our investments in debt securities were limited to issues which were rated aa or higher at the time of purchase 
in the event that we attempt to liquidate a portion of our holdings through an auction and are unable to do so  we term it an auction failure 
on february   we began to experience auction failures 
as of december   all our investments in auction rate securities  with a total par value of million  have experienced multiple failed auctions 
in the event of an auction failure  the interest rate on the security is reset according to the contractual terms in the underlying indenture

the current instability in the credit markets may continue to affect our ability to liquidate these securities 
we will be unable to liquidate these securities until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures or it is purchased by a buyer outside the auction process 
based on the frequency of auction failures and the lack of market activity  current market prices are not available for determining the fair value of these investments

table of contents impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
in general  the price increases we have passed along to our customers have offset inflationary pressures 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid  medicare  and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts  the fair value of our investments in debt securities  and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to products  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation consultants 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
we use a straight line method of amortization for our intangible assets 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  during the first quarter  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
we review our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in 
table of contents some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture or supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  new legislation or regulatory proposals 
the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of december  are as follows gross carrying accumulated net book amount amortization value in thousands branded prescription pharmaceuticals avinza skelaxin sonata flector patch neuroscience synercid other hospital hospital bicillin other legacy products legacy products total branded animal health meridian auto injector royalties and other total intangible assets 
table of contents the amounts of impairments and amortization expense for the years ended december  and are as follows for the years ended december  amortization amortization impairments expense impairments expense in thousands in thousands branded prescription pharmaceuticals avinza skelaxin sonata flector patch neuroscience synercid other hospital hospital bicillin altace other legacy products legacy products total branded animal health meridian auto injector royalties and other total the remaining amortization periods for significant branded prescription pharmaceutical products are as follows remaining life at december  skelaxin months avinza years months flector patch years synercid years bicillin years months inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate our entire inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we make a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements  or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities that we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 

table of contents accruals for rebates  returns and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks  medicaid  medicare and commercial rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily on historical sales and return rates 
we also consider the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel 
we base our estimate of our medicaid rebate  medicare rebate and commercial rebate accruals on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our commercial and regulatory rebate obligations 
we base our estimate of our chargeback accrual on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
the estimate of the level of our products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our three key wholesalers under inventory management agreements 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyze these products for potential additional supplemental reserves 
investments in debt securities 
prior to the end of the first quarter of we invested in debt securities 
tax exempt auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through an auction process generally every seven  or days 
on february   we began to experience auction failures with respect to our investments in auction rate securities 
all of our investments in auction rate securities have experienced multiple failed auctions 
we will not be able to liquidate these securities until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures or it is purchased by a buyer outside the auction process 
based on the frequency of auction failures and the lack of market activity  current market prices are not available for determining the fair value of these investments 
as a result  we measure these investments using unobservable inputs 
the fair value of investments in debt securities is based on a trinomial discount model 
this model considers the probability at the valuation date of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of the security 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include  but are not limited to  the security s collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each security is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
the discount rate is determined as the loss adjusted required rate of return using public information such as spreads or near risk free to risk free assets 
the expected term is based on our estimate of future liquidity as of the balance sheet date 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is 
table of contents generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
we launched embeda in late september we have recognized revenue on embeda in a manner consistent with our other products  as described above  which is generally at the time the product is received by the customer 
we believe embeda has similar characteristics of certain of our other pharmaceutical products such that we can reliably estimate expected returns of the product 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of some of our investments investment risk  the effect of interest rate changes interest rate risk and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange rate risk 
at december  we held derivative financial instruments associated with the convertible senior notes 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts which expired during the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth below 
investment risk we have marketable securities which are carried at fair value based on current market quotes 
gains and losses on securities are based on the specific identification method 
for additional information related to our investment in debt securities  please see liquidity and capital resources in item above 
interest rate risk the fair market value fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures is affected by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term fixed rate debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt as changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
as of december   our variable rate debt totaled million and a change in interest rates would have an annualized pre tax effect of million in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as of december  while our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
less than of our revenues and net income are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
if the us dollar were to devalue against other currencies by  the expected effect on our revenues and net income would be immaterial
