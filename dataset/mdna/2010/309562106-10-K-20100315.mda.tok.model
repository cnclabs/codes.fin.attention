it had total assets of million at december  lending a significant part of the company s operating activities include originating loans  approximately of which are secured by real estate at december  real estate lending primarily includes loans secured by owner and non owner occupied one to four family residential properties as well as commercial real estate mortgage loans to developers and owners of other commercial real estate 
real estate lending primarily includes both variable and adjustable rate products 
loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward immediately based on changes in the loan s index  normally prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
rates on adjustable rate loans move upward or downward after an initial fixed term of normally one  three  or five years 
rate adjust ments on adjustable rate loans are made annually after the initial fixed term expires and are indexed mainly to shorter term treasury indexes 
generally  variable and adjustable rate loans contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases over the life of the loan of up to basis points and lifetime floors of basis points 
in addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments  loans secured by residential real estate typically contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of basis points 
there is typically no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate 
the company also makes fixed rate commercial real estate loans to a lesser extent with repayment terms generally not exceeding months 
the company s subsidiary banks make first and second residential mortgage loans secured by real estate not to exceed loan to value without seeking third party guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are made primarily to small and mid sized businesses  secured by real estate not exceeding loan to value 
other commercial loans are asset based loans secured by equipment and lines of credit secured by receivables and include lending across a diverse range of business types 
commercial lending and real estate construction lending  including commercial leasing  generally includes a higher degree of credit risk than other loans  such as residential mortgage loans 
commercial loans  like other loans  are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements 
collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower s financial strength  the terms and amount of the loan  and collateral available to secure the loan 
credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower 
credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loans outstanding balance 
for construction lo ans  inaccurate initial estimates of a project s costs and the property s completed value could weaken the company s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property 
secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles  boats  and other motor vehicles 
in most cases loans are restricted to the subsidiaries general market area 
supervision and regulation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of their operations 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and borrowers and  to a lesser extent  stockholders 
changes in applicable laws  regulations  or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business 
the following summarizes certain of the more important aspects of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions 
supervisory authorities the company is a bank holding company  registered with and regulated by the federal reserve board frb 
all five of its subsidiary banks are kentucky state chartered banks 
three of the company s subsidiary banks are members of their regional federal reserve bank 
the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions kdfi 
the regulatory authorities routinely examine the company and its subsidiary banks to monitor their compliance with laws and regulations  financial condition  adequacy of capital and reserves  quality and documentation of loans  payment of dividends  adequacy of systems and controls  credit underwriting and asset li ability management  and the establishment of branches 
the company and its subsidiary banks are required to file regular reports with the frb  the fdic and the kdfi  as applicable 
capital the frb  the fdic  and the kdfi require the company and its subsidiary banks to meet certain ratios of capital to assets in order to conduct their activities 
to be well capitalized  the institutions must generally maintain a total capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or better 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity and related surplus  retained earnings  and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill net of certain deferred tax liabilities and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and a limited amount of other items 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are generally weighted for risk 
certain assets  such as cash and us government securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as commercial and consumer loans  have a risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  assets are not risk weighted 
if the institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a series of restrictions that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company  if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result 
undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval  which must be guaranteed by the institution s parent holding company 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell suffici ent voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
expansion and activity limitations with prior regulatory approval  the company may acquire other banks or bank holding companies and its subsidiaries may merge with other banks 
acquisitions of banks located in other states may be subject to certain deposit percentage  age or other restrictions 
during the third quarter of  the company withdrew its financial company election with the sale of its khl subsidiary 
financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities such as insurance underwriting  securities underwriting and distribution  travel agency activities  broad insurance agency activities  merchant banking  and other nonbanking activities that the frb determines to be financial in nature or complementary to these activities 
the frb normally requires so me form of notice or application to engage in or acquire companies engaged in such activities 
under the bank holding company act and gramm leach bliley act  the company is generally prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in activities other than those referred to above 
limitations on acquisitions of bank holding companies in general  other companies seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company such as the company would require the approval of the frb under the bank holding company act 
in addition  individuals or groups of individuals seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company such as the company would need to file a prior notice with the frb which the frb may disapprove under certain circumstances under the change in bank control act 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company 
control may exist under the change in bank control act if the individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company and no shareholder holds a larger percentage of the subject class of voting securiti es 
deposit insurance all of the company s subsidiary banks are members of the fdic  and their deposits are insured by the fdic s deposit insurance fund up to the amount permitted by law 
the company s subsidiary banks are thus subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
under the federal deposit insurance reform act of  which became law in  the company received a one time assessment credit of million that can be applied against future premiums  subject to certain limitations 
based on the one time assessment credit  the company was not required to pay any deposit insurance premiums in and unused credits from limited the amount of d eposit insurance premiums to thousand for lower credits remained to offset assessments for and all such credits were exhausted during financing corporation fico assessment costs were thousand and thousand for and  respectively 
fico is a mixed ownership government corporation established by the competitive equality banking act of possessing assessment powers in addition to the fdic 
the fdic acts as a collection agent for fico  whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct federal savings loan insurance corporation 
the company s participation in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program initiated during the fourth quarter of has also contributed to an increase in deposit insurance premiums 
more information about this program can be found under the heading temporary liquidity guarantee program that follows 
during the fourth quarter of the fdic increased the deposit insurance from generally thousand for each separately insured depositor to thousand initially effective until december  the increased limits have been extended to june  in february  the fdic adopted a long term deposit insurance fund dif restoration plan as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increases base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from its then current 
to its statutorily mandated minimum of within eight years as amended 
beginning april  the fdic establishes a banks initial base assessment rate  ranging between and basis points  depending on the banks risk category 
the initial base assessment rate is then adjusted higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
adjustments to the initial base assessment rate are based on a banks level of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate ranges between and basis points and is applied to a banks assessable deposits when computing the fdic insurance assessment amount 
the fdic s emergency special assessment for was adopted on may and supersedes its interim rule adopted in march that would have imposed a basis point assessment with an option for an additional basis point assessment 
under the final rule adopted  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on a bank s total assets minus tier capital as of june  and collected september  the company paid million related to the special assessment 
the final rule also authorizes the fdic to impose up to two additional basis points assessments if needed while capping each assessment at basis points of the banks assessment base 
in addition to the fdic s special assessment for  the fdic in november approved a final rule requiring banks to prepay their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of as well as all of   and on december  the prepayment was adopted by the fdic in lieu of an additional special assessment as summarized above 
the assessment rate to be used for all periods covered in the prepayment plan was the banks assessment rate in effect as of september  the assessment rate will be increased by basis points for all of and the prepayment is based on a bank s regular assessment base total domestic deposits as of september   with an estimated quarterly increase of an estimated annual growth rate through the end of the company paid million on d ecember  related to this assessment

the federal banking agencies may prevent the payment of a dividend if they determine that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
moreover  the federal ag encies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings

the company has historically managed its banks capital levels with the goal of meeting the criteria established by its regulators for each bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized 
historically  to be well capitalized  a depository institution needed to have a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as of december   each of the company s five subsidiary banks satisfied these capital ratios 
although each of the company s subsidiary banks was well capitalized as of december   some of their capital levels have decreased over the past eighteen months as a result of the economic downturn that began in late because of the turmoil in the banking markets and continued difficulty many banks are experiencing with their loan portfolios  bank regulatory agencies are increasingly requiring banks to maintain higher capital reserves as a cushion for dealing with any further deterioration in their loan portfolios in order to maintain well capitalized status 
following recent examinations  the company s banking regulators have required capital infusions in order to satisfy higher minimum capital ratios at three of the company s banking subsidiaries and have taken other supervisory act ions

the company applied for regulatory approval for the merger in the first quarter of with an anticipated effective date for the merger in the second quarter of the company has received regulatory approval from the kdfi  but has yet to receive a response from the frb st 
louis 
in light of the proposed merger of lawrenceburg bank into farmers bank  the kdfi and frb st 
louis have agreed that at this time no additional capital needs to be infused in lawrenceburg bank 
at the time of the planned merger  however  the company may be required to inject additional capital into farmers bank as a result of the merger depending on the operating results of farmers bank and lawrenceburg bank in the period leading up to the time of the planned merger 
at december  lawrenceburg bank had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based ratio of farmers bank 
farmers bank was the subject of a regularly scheduled examination by the kdfi which was conducted in mid september as a result of this examination  the kdfi and frb st 
louis have entered into a memorandum of understanding with farmers bank 
the memorandum of understanding  among other things  requires that farmers bank obtain written consent prior to declaring or paying the parent company a cash dividend and to achieve and maintain increasing leverage ratios of   and by december   march   and june   respectively

united bank 
as a result of an examination conducted in late july and early august of  the fdic proposed united bank enter into a cease and desist order order primarily as a result of its level of non performing assets 
while united bank articulated to the fdic and kdfi its strong objection and disagreement that an order was appropriate especially given the actions taken by united bank prior to the examination to identify and manage its non performing assets  united bank has negotiated certain content and requirements of the proposed order and  as a result  voluntarily consented to the order 
among its requirements  the order requires united bank to achieve leverage ratios of   and by december   march   and june   respectively  and a total risk based ratio of immediately 
on october  the parent company injected million from its reserves into united bank 
at december  united bank had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based ratio of 
the leverage ratio of was below the required amount at year end as stated in the order  however  the leverage ratio was after adjusting for the year end goodwill impairment charge that reduced total assets at united bank 
the reduction in assets attributed to goodwill did not immediately impact average assets the denominator in calculating the leverage ratio 
the impact of the goodwill charge will positively impact the leverage ratio beginning in the company may fund any additional external capital requirements of farmers bank  united bank or any of its other banking subsidiaries from future public or private sales of securities at an appropriate time or from existing resources of the company 
competition the company and its subsidiaries face vigorous competition for banking services from various types of businesses other than commercial banks and savings and loan associations 
these include  but are not limited to  credit unions  mortgage lenders  finance companies  insurance companies  stock and bond brokers  financial planning firms  and department stores which compete for one or more lines of banking business 
the company also competes for commercial and retail business not only with banks in central and northern kentucky  but with banking organizations from ohio  indiana  tennessee  pennsylvania  and north carolina which have banking subsidiaries located in kentucky 
these competing businesses may possess greater resources and offer a greater number of branch locations  higher lending limits  and ma y offer other services not provided by the company 
in addition  the company s competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to the company and its subsidiary banks 
the company has attempted to offset some of the advantages of its competitors by arranging participations with other banks for loans above its legal lending limits  expanding into additional markets and product lines  and entering into third party arrangements to better compete for its targeted customer base 
competition from other providers of financial services may reduce or limit the company s profitability and market share 
the company competes primarily on the basis of quality of services  interest rates and fees charged on loans  and the rates of interest paid on deposit funds 
the business of the company is not dependent upon any one customer or on a few customers  and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the company

risk factors investing in the company s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the company s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the company are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the market price of the company s common stock could decline significantly  and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
the company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations  including rules and policies applicable to participants in the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
the company is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or laws could have a substantial adverse impact on the company and its operations 
additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect the company s powers  authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
further  in the performance of their supervisory duties and enforcement powers  the company s banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy practices they deem as unsafe or unsound or violations of law 
as a recipient of investment by the treasury in our series a preferred stock under the cpp  the company is subject to future regulations of the treasury and future acts of congress related to that program 
the laws and policies applicable to recipients of capital under the cpp have been significantly revised and supplemented since the inception of that program  and continue to evolve 
the exercise of regulatory authority generally may have a negative impact on the company s operations  which may be material on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company presently is subject to  and in the future may become subject to  additional supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on its business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of its common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  the kdfi for state chartered banks  the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve for bank holding companies and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits  have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on the company s part if they determine that the company has insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices 
under this authority  bank regulators can require the company to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 
as a result of increased levels of nonperforming assets at farmers bank  lawrenceburg bank and united bank  the parent company  farmers bank and lawrenceburg bank have entered into separate memoranda of understanding with our regulators and united bank has consented to a cease and desist order from its regulators 
in the aggregate  these memoranda of understanding and the cease and desist order  among other things  require the company to develop an acceptable capital plan to ensure that the consolidated organization remains well capitalized and each of its subsidiary banks meet the capital requirements imposed by their regulator as described elsewhere in this report  increase the regulatory capital ratios at these three banks  these three banks refrain from paying dividends to the parent company unless approved i n advance by the regulators and the company not make future interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without seeking prior approval from frb st 
louis 
the company received approval for both its regularly scheduled trust preferred payments and dividends on its series a preferred stock through the end of  as well as the 
per share dividend on its common stock that was declared on october  representatives of frb st 
louis have indicated to the company that as long as its subsidiaries show adequate normalized earnings to support the quarterly payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its series a preferred stock and common stock  they will provide the required prior approval  but there is no guarantee that such adequate normalized earnings will be realized and that such dividends will be approved in the future 
the company also received approval for its regularly scheduled trust preferred interest payments through the first quarter of and dividends on its series a preferred stock that was paid on february  the last time such approval was requested by the company 
the company determined to forego the dividend that has historically been declared on its common stock in the first quarter of in an effort to conserve capital 
if the company is unable to comply with the terms of its current regulatory orders  or is unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory orders to which it may become subject  then we could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including cease and desist orders  prompt corrective actions and or other regulatory enforcement actions 
if the company s regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
if one or more of the company s banks were unable to com ply with regulatory requirements  such banks could ultimately face failure 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
our nonperforming assets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and take significant management time to resolve 
as of december   nonperforming loans totaled million or of the company s total loan portfolio and its nonperforming assets which include foreclosed real estate were million or of total assets 
additionally  approximately million of the company s accruing loans were days delinquent as of december  non performing assets adversely affect the company s net income in various ways 
if economic conditions do not improve or actually worsen in our markets  the company could continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in non performing assets 
the company does not record interest income on non accrual loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting interest income 
when the company takes collateral in fo reclosures and similar proceedings  it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  which decreases earnings 
these loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital the company s regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks 
while the company seeks to reduce its problem loans through workouts  restructurings and otherwise  decreases in the value of these assets  the underlying collateral or our borrowers performance or financial conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management of our banks  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further increases in nonperfo rming loans in the future 
losses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance established for that purpose  which will have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
volatility and deterioration in the broader economy increases the company s risk of credit losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
if a significant number of loans in the company s portfolio are not repaid  it would have an adverse effect on its earnings and overall financial condition 
like all banks  the company s subsidiaries maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management of each subsidiary s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in their loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
this evaluation is primarily based upon a review of the bank s and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  know n risks contained in the bank s loan portfolio  composition and growth of the bank s loan portfolio and economic factors 
additionally  a bank s regulators may require additional provision for the loan portfolio in connection with regulatory examinations  agreements or orders 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
as a result  the company s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to cover actual losses in its loan portfolio 
consequently  the company risks having additional future provisions for loan losses that may continue to adversely affect its earnings 
if the company s local markets experience a prolonged recession  it may be required to make further increases in its allowance for loan losses and to charge off additional loans  which would adversely affect its results of operations and capital 
for the year  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million  million of which was in the fourth quarter  and recorded net loan charge offs of million  million of which was in the fourth quarter 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of million and net loan charge offs of million for  and a million provision and thousand of net loan charge offs which were recorded for the fourth quarter of during  the company has experienced increased loan delinquencies and credit losses and do not expect this to change in the near future 
substantially all of the company s loans are to businesses and individuals located in kentucky 
a continuing decline in the economy of central and northern kentucky could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
generally  the company s non performing loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers  however  more recently the deterioration in the general economy has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of delinquencies and non performing loans 
slower sales and excess inventory in the residential housing market has been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures for residential construction and land development loans 
as of december   the company s total non performing loans had increased to million or of total loans compared to million or of total loans at december  if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  the company expects that it will continue to experience hig her than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if a prolonged recession occurs  the company expects that it could severely impact economic conditions in its market areas and that it could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  the company may be required to make further increases in its provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
if such additional provisions and charge offs cause the company to experience losses  it may be required to contribute additional capital to its bank subsidiaries to maintain capital ratios required by regulators 
the company s exposure to credit risk is increased by its real estate development lending 
real estate development loans have dominated the company s increase in impaired loans 
substantially all of the company s million nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  are secured by real estate 
development lending has historically been considered to be higher credit risk than single family residential lending 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers 
such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy in general because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development and  in most cases  sale of their property 
these loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortized over the loan period  but have a balloo n payment due at maturity of the loan 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property 
in the current economic environment  the ability of borrowers to refinance or sell newly developed property or vacant land has greatly diminished 
if the real estate markets were to worsen or not improve  the company would likely experience increased credit losses and require additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses  which would adversely impact the company s earnings and financial condition 
the company s investment securities portfolio is comparatively larger than other community banks and it is more dependent on its investment portfolio to generate net income 
unlike many other community banks  the company relies more heavily on its investment securities portfolio as a source of interest income because it has a comparatively small loan portfolio 
if the company is not able to successfully manage the interest rate spread on the investment portfolio  its net interest income would decrease  which would adversely affect its results of operations and could negatively impact net income 
investment securities tend to have a lower risk than loans  and as such  generally provide a lower yield 
in the company sold and realized net gains on investment securities 
the company may not have the same level of net gains and may have net realized losses in future periods on the sale of investment securities  which would reduce earnings 
moreover  due to the current interest rate environment  proceeds from recent sales may be reinvested in investment securities with lower yields which may reduce earnings from investment securities 
the deterioration in the credit markets experienced in and into created volatility in the market and illiquidity of certain securities  resulting in significant declines in the market values of those investments 
the company continues to monitor its investment portfolio for deteriorating values and other than temporary impairments 
any material other than temporary impairments would likewise have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and could lead to additional losses 
if the company records goodwill in connection with an acquisition and it becomes impaired  the company s results of operations would be adversely impacted 
accounting standards require that the company account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of an acquiree over the net of the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed 
in accordance with us gaap  goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment to goodwill exists 
such evaluation is based on a variety of factors  including the quoted price of our common stock  market prices of common stock of other banking organizations  common stock trading multiples  discounted cash flows and data from comparable acquisitions 
prior to the recording of an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of  the company had goodwill of million related primarily to the acquisitions of citizens northern in and citizens jessamine now part of united bank in during the fourth quarter of the company concluded that due to poor overall economic conditions and declines in the company s stock price  it was more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit was below the carrying value and a pre tax impairment charge was recorded in the amount of million 
such impairment charge was a one time  non cash transaction that had no effect on tangible common equity or an adverse effect on regulatory capital  however  it did have a material negative impact on the company s earnings that resulted in a net loss for the company cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economy on its future results of operations or the market price of its stock 
the national economy and the financial services sector in particular continue to face unique challenges when compared to recent history 
the company cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted its performance and the markets it serves 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in the company s local markets would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects  and could also cause the market price of the company s stock to decline 
while it is impossible to predict how long these recessionary conditions may exist  the economic downturn could continue to present risks for some time for our industry and the company 
interest rate volatility could significantly harm the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  the policies of the company s regulators  and the prevailing interest rates in the united states and the company s markets 
in addition  it is increasingly common for the company s competitors  who may be aggressively seeking to attract deposits as a result of increased liquidity concerns arising from current economic conditions  to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates 
a significant component of the company s earnings is the net interest income of its subsidiary banks  which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets  such as loans  and the expense of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
a change in market interest rates could adversely affect the company s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it collects on loans and investments  or  alternatively  if interest rates earned on earning assets decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities 
consequently  as with most financial institutions  the company is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
the fdic has increased deposit insurance premiums to restore and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund  which has increased costs to the company 
during the second quarter of  the fdic increased deposit insurance assessment rates generally and imposed a special assessment of five basis points on each insured institution s total assets less tier capital 
this special assessment was calculated based on the insured institution s assets at june   and was collected on september  based on the level of insured deposits in our subsidiary banks as of june   the special assessments on our subsidiary banks totaled approximately million 
this special assessment is in addition to the regular quarterly risk based assessment 
in the wake of the rapid depletion of the fdic s deposit insurance fund resulting from many recent bank failures  the fdic announced that all insured institutions will be required to pay the next three years quarterly assessments in advance in the fourth quarter of this resulted in an aggregate payment by the company s bank subsidiaries totaling million in the fourth quarter of the three years advance payment was recorded as a prepaid asset that will be expensed in approximately equal amounts over the next three years and  thus  only impact earnings in the normal course 
however  the advance payment reduced the liquid assets of the company s bank subsidiaries at the time of payment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant deposit insurance premium assessments as the deposit insurance fund is further depleted 
any future losses may require the company to raise additional capital  however  such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain levels of capital to support its operations 
furthermore  in the wake of recent regularly scheduled examinations of three of its subsidiaries  the company s regulators have required these three banks to raise their capital to levels significantly above the well capitalized benchmark 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time and on the company s future financial condition and performance 
accordingly  the company cannot make assurances with respect to its ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand its op erations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
the tightening of available liquidity could limit the company s ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand  which could adversely affect its earnings and capital levels 
a tightening of the credit and liquidity markets and the company s inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits may negatively affect its earnings and capital levels 
in addition to deposit growth  maturity of investment securities and loan payments from borrowers  the company relies from time to time on advances from the federal home loan bank and other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits 
in the event of a further downturn in the economy  these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to the company 
the company s liquidity position could be significantly constrained if it were unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank or other wholesale funding sources 
the company s financial condition and outlook may be adversely affected by damage to its reputation 
the company s financial condition and outlook is highly dependent upon perceptions of its business practices and reputation 
its ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged 
negative public opinion could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including regulatory actions taken against the company  lending practices  corporate governance  regulatory compliance  mergers of its subsidiaries  or sharing or inadequate protection of customer information 
damage to the company s reputation could give rise to loss of customers and legal risks  which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition 
the company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services 
the company conducts most of its operations in central and northern kentucky 
the banking and financial services businesses in these areas are highly competitive and increased competition in its primary market areas may adversely impact the level of its loans and deposits 
ultimately  the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  the company s competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace ad vantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
if the company is unable to attract and retain banking customers  it may be unable to continue its loan growth and level of deposits 
the company s financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
the financial accounting standards board and the sec frequently change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws  regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
the short term and long term impact of a likely new capital framework  whether through the current proposal for non basel ii us banking institutions or through another set of capital standards  is uncertain 
for us banking institutions with assets of less than billion and foreign exposures of less than billion  including the company and its subsidiaries  a proposal is currently pending that would apply to them the standardized approach of the new risk based capital standards developed by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii 
as a result of the recent deterioration in the global credit markets and increases in credit  liquidity  interest rate  and other risks  the us banking regulators have discussed possible increases in capital requirements  separate from the current proposal for the standardized approach of basel ii 
furthermore  in august  the treasury issued principles for international regulatory reform  which included recommendations for higher capital standards for all banking organizations 
any new capital framework is likely to affect the cost and availability of different types of credit 
us banking organizations are likely to be required to hold higher levels of capital and could incur increased compliance costs 
any of these developments  including increased capital requirements  could have a material negative effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition and require it to raise additional new capital 
the price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult to resell it when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of its common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section general economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets  changes in global financial markets  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical events  conditions in our local and national credit  mortgage and housing markets  developments with respect to financial institutions generally  including government regulation  our dividend practice  and actual and anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and earnings 
the market value of the company s common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general  including price and trading fluctuations 
these conditions may result in volatility in the level of  and fluctuations in  the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  the company s common stock and sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the market  in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the company s common stock 
there may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the company s equity  which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
the market price of the company s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the company of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur 
the company s board of directors is authorized generally to cause it to issue additional common stock  as well as series of preferred stock  without any action on the part of the company s shareholders except as may be required under the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  the board has the power  without shareholder approval  to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights  preferences and other terms 
this could include preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation 
if the company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if the company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
you may not receive dividends on the company s common stock 
holders of the company s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if its board of directors declares them  and as permitted by its regulators 
although the company has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock  it is not required to do so 
the company s board of directors reduced its quarterly common stock dividend in january from 
per share to 
per share and again in october to 
per share 
in the first quarter of  the board of directors determined to forego the dividend that has historically been declared on its common stock in the first quarter in an effort to conserve capital 
this decision is consistent with those made by other financial organizations as they deal with the difficult economic times and the changing regulator y climate 
the company has agreed that it will not make interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without prior approval from the frb st

the company requested and received approval for its regularly scheduled interest payment on its trust preferred and the dividend on its series a preferred stock through the end of  as well as its 
per share dividend on its common stock that was declared on october  the company also received approval for its dividend payment on its series a preferred stock payable february  and for its regularly scheduled interest payments on its trust preferred securities through the first quarter of the last time such approval was requested by the company 
representatives of the frb st 
louis have indicated to the company that as long as its subsidiaries show adequate normalized earnings to support the quarterly payments on its trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on its series a preferred stock and common stock  they will provide the required prior approval 
however  there can be no assurance the company s regulators will provide such approvals in the future 
in addition  the company s payment of dividends is subject to certain restrictions as a result of its issuance of series a preferred stock to the treasury on january  under the tarp cpp 
the dividends declared on the company s series a preferred stock reduce the net income available to common stockholders and reduce earnings per common share 
moreover  under the terms of the company s articles of incorporation  it is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of its common stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series a preferred stock 
further  until january   the company must have the treasury s approval before it may increase dividends on its common stock above the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share we declared prior to october   which was 
per share 
this restriction no longer applies if all the series a preferred stock has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
finally  if the company is in arrears on interest payments on its trust preferred securities  it may not pay dividends on its common stock until such interest obligations are brought current 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiary banks and certain regulatory considerations 
the parent company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary banks 
as a result  the company s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its bank subsidiaries 
there are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of three of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to the parent company and its ability to make payments to its shareholders  including certain regulatory approvals of dividends or distributions 
there can be no assurance that the company will receive such approval or that it will be able to continue to pay its current dividend to shareholders 
the trading volume in the company s common stock is less than that of many other similar companies 
the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select stock market 
as of december  the day average trading volume of the company s common stock on nasdaq was  shares or 
of the total common shares outstanding 
an efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of a stock at any given time 
the company has no control over such individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions 
given the lower trading volume of the company s common stock  larger sales volumes of its common stock could cause the value of its common stock to decrease 
moreover  due to its lower trading volume it may take longer to liquidate your position in the company s com mon stock 
there can be no assurance when the series a preferred stock and related warrant issued to the treasury can be redeemed 
subject to consultation with banking regulators  the company intends to repurchase the series a preferred stock  and potentially the warrant  it issued to the treasury when it believes the credit metrics in its loan portfolio have improved for the long term and the overall economy has rebounded 
however  there can be no assurance when the series a preferred stock and warrant held by the treasury can be repurchased  if at all 
until such time as the series a preferred stock are repurchased  the company will remain subject to the terms and conditions of those instruments  which  among other things  limit the company s ability to repurchase or redeem common stock or increase the dividends on its common stock over 
per share prior to further  the company s continued participation in the cpp subjects it to increased regulatory and legislative oversight  including with respect to executive compensation 
these new and any future oversight and legal requirements and implementing standards under the cpp may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry as a whole  and particularly on cpp participants such as the company 
holders of the series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of the company s common stockholders 
the series a preferred stock that the company issued to the treasury is senior to the company s shares of common stock  and holders of the series a preferred stock have certain rights and preferences that are senior to holders of the company s common stock 
the restrictions on the company s ability to declare and pay dividends to common stockholders are discussed above 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries may not purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the company s common stock unless the company has paid in full all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock for all prior dividend periods  other than in certain circumstances 
furthermore  the series a preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference over shares of the company s com mon stock in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
holders of the series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
except in connection with the election of two directors to the company s board of directors if its dividends on the series a preferred stock are in arrears and we have missed six quarterly dividends and as otherwise required by law  holders of the company s series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the company s articles of incorporation  the vote or consent of holders owning at least of the shares of series a preferred stock outstanding is required for any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the series a preferred stock  any amendment to the rights of the series a preferred stock that adversely affects the rights  preferences  privileges or voting power of the series a preferred stock  or consummation of any merger  share exchange or similar transaction unless the shares of series a preferred stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity other than the company and have such rights  preferences  privileges and voting power as are not materially less favorable than those of the holders of the series a preferred stock 
the company s common stock constitutes equity and is subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness and its series a preferred stock  and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non common equity claims against its subsidiaries 
shares of the company s common stock represent equity interests in our holding company and do not constitute indebtedness 
accordingly  the shares of the company s common stock rank junior to all of its indebtedness and to other non equity claims on farmers capital bank corporation with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims 
additionally  dividends to holders of the company s common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the company s series a preferred stock and any additional preferred stock we may issue 
the series a preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
the company s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or otherwise  and thus the ability of the company s common stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution  will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
as a result  holders of the company s common stock will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries  including claims of depositors 
as of december  our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately billion 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock after an initial five year period  the cost of this capital will increase substantially 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase from approximately million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value to million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value 
this increase in the annual dividend rate on the series a preferred stock would have a material negative effect on the earnings the company can retain for growth and to pay dividends on its common stock 
the current economic environment exposes the company to higher credit losses and expenses and may result in lower earnings or increase the likelihood of losses 
although the company remains well capitalized  it is operating in a very challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions  including the company  are being adversely effected by harsh economic conditions that have impacted not only local markets  but on a national and global scale 
substantial deterioration in real estate and other financial markets have and may continue to adversely impact the company s financial performance 
continuing declines in real estate values and home sales volumes  along with job losses and other economic stresses can decrease the value of collateral securing loans extended to borrowers  particularly that of real estate loans 
lower values of real estate securing loans may make it more difficult for the company to recover amounts it is owed in the event of default by a borrower 
the current economic conditions may result in a higher degree of financial stress on the company s borrowers and their customers which could impair the company s ability to collect payments on loans  potentially increasing loan delinquencies  nonperforming assets  foreclosures  and higher losses 
current market forces have and may in the future cause the value of investment securities or other assets held by the company to deteriorate  resulting in impairment charges  higher losses  and lower regulatory capital levels 
market volatility could adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity position  and access to additional capital 
the capital and credit markets have experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during the current and preceding year  with unprecedented levels of volatility and disruptions taking place over the last few months of in many cases  this has led to downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital 
there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation and regulatory initiatives will help stabilize the us financial system 
eesa was signed into law by the president on october  as a measure to stabilize and provide liquidity to the us financial markets 
this legislation provides broad authority to the us treasury to invest directly in qualifying financial institutions  increase fdic deposit insurance coverage to thousand for interest bearing accounts  and other significant regulatory authority designed to strengthen us financial markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of the recently enacted legislation or regulatory initiatives or the company s participation in such programs will have the desired effect 
the failure of eesa  fdic  or other us government initiatives to stabilize the us financial system and a continuing or worsening of financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations  financial condition  or access to credit 
risks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of limited market area 
commercial banks and other financial institutions  including the company  are affected by economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  value of the dollar  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect profitability 
in addition  almost all of the company s primary business area is located in central and northern kentucky 
a significant downturn in this regional economy may result in  among other things  deterioration in the company s credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and may harm the financial stability of the company s customers 
due to the company s regio nal market area  these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on the company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger  more diverse market area 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans 
lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by unanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral 
due to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans  such loans present a greater risk to the company than other types of loans when non payment by a borrower occurs 
in addition  consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans  but generally carry higher risks of frequency of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
combining a newly acquired bank or other business entity with the company s network of banks may be more difficult  costly or time consuming than expected 
the company has generally operated newly acquired banks as independent bank subsidiaries within the network of the company s existing banking subsidiaries 
combining newly acquired banks or other entities within this network usually involves converting certain data processing functions from their current format  changing some of the policies and procedures in place  and other integration issues 
it is possible that integration processes could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  procedures and policies that would adversely affect the company s ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of a merger 
if difficulties with the integration processes occur  we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect resulting from an acquisition 
as with any merger of banking institutions  there also may be business disruptions that cause a newly acquired bank to lose customers or cause customers to take their deposits out of the bank and move their business to other financial institutions 
inability to hire or retain certain key professionals  management and staff could adversely affect revenues and net income 
the company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business  including major revenue generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios 
the loss of key staff may adversely affect the company s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively  which could negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses  which could cause a decrease in our net income 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
the company s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition

application of critical accounting policies the company s audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility from period to period 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniq ues 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in 
note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements  and accounting for business acquisitions and related goodwill to be t he accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets 
additional information related to the allo wance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions

nonperforming assets in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as notes 
and

fair value measurements the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements  either directly or indirectly 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in certain cases  an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis  such as investment securities classified as available for sale 
in other cases  management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write down or whether a valuation reserve should be established 
the company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods 
where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices  quoted market prices are used for fair value 
the company characterizes active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information  with reasonably narrow bid ask spreads  and where received quoted prices do not vary widely 
when the financial instruments are not actively traded  other observable market inputs  such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics  may be used  if available  to determine fair value 
inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes  price quotations that vary substantially among market participants  or in which minimal information is released publicly 
when observable market prices do not exist  the company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods 
the valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns 
other factors such as model assumptions  market dislocations  and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value 
changes in these underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded 
additional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in notes 
and 
of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements  as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the company available for sale investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis 
available for sale investment securities are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include  but not limited to  the following inputs us treasury securities are priced using dealer quotes from active market makers and real time trading systems 
marketable equity securities are priced utilizing real time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities 
government sponsored agency debt securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields  matrix pricing  prepayment speeds  cash flows  live trading data  and market spreads sourced from new issues  dealer quotes  and trade prices  among others sources 
at december   all of the company s available for sale investment securities were measured using observable market data 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo includes properties acquired by the company through actual loan foreclosures and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value of oreo is generally based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data comprised of significant unobservable inputs 
if the carrying amount of the oreo exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell  an impairment loss is recorded through expense 
at december  oreo was million compared to million at year end impaired loans loans are considered impaired when full payment under the contractual terms is not expected 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance  the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
appraisals used in connection with valuing collateral dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach 
appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available 
such adjustments are usually significant and typically include significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value 
impaired loans were million and million at year end and  respectively 
accounting for business acquisitions and related goodwill prior to january   the company accounted for its business acquisitions as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 whereby the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
effective january   the company adopted new accounting guidance that requires the recognition of noncontrolling interests  expensing acquisition related costs  and measuring goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase option  among other requirements 
the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
determining fair value of assets and liabilities requires many assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are sometimes refined subsequent to the initial recording of the transaction with adjustments to goodwill as information is gathered and final appraisals are completed 
the changes in these estimates could impact the amount of tangible and intangible assets including goodwill and liabilities ultimately recorded on the company s balance sheet as a result of an acquisition  and could materially impact the company s operating results subsequent to such acquisition 
the company believes that its estimates have been materially accurate in the past 
executive level overview the company offers a variety of financial products and services at its banking locations in communities throughout central and northern kentucky 
the most significant products and services include consumer and commercial lending and leasing  receiving deposits  providing trust services  and offering other traditional banking products and services 
the primary goals of the company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value  maintain a strong capital position  provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure  and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees 
the company generates a significant amount of its revenue  cash flows  and net income from interest income and net interest income  respectively 
interest income is generated by earnings on the company s earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest expense paid on amounts borrowed to support those earning assets 
interest expense is paid primarily on deposit accounts and other short and long term borrowing arrangements 
the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the company 
managing credit risk  or the risk of loss due to customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms  is also a factor that can significantly influence the operating results of the company 
the severe downturn in financial markets and in the overall economy during and into created unprecedented market volatility 
certain capital markets ceased to function and credit markets were unavailable to many businesses and consumers 
in response  the us government took extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets by enacting broad legislation and regulatory initiatives that included the largest stimulus plan in its history 
while there are signs of improvement in the us financial markets and the overall economy  certain key metrics  such as high unemployment and lower r eal estate values  have had a significant negative impact on the company s operations 
these events have had a direct impact on the company in the form of higher nonperforming loans  an increase in the allowance for loan losses  and higher net loan charge offs 
following are the more significant events that summarize the company s operating results for the company recorded a one time  non cash  pretax goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of which does not impact regulatory capital 
the impairment charge was attributed to the decline in the company s common share price  which has suffered similar to other peer financial institutions as a result of continuing economic weaknesses and heightened market concern surrounding the credit risk profile and capital positions of financial institutions 
nonperforming assets have grown as a result of an increasing number of our borrowers that are unable to repay their loans due mainly as a result of the ongoing economic challenges that they and their customers face 
this has resulted in lower interest income  a higher provision for loans losses  and impairment charges related to properties that the company has repossessed in an attempt to satisfy customer loan obligations 
the parent company and three of its subsidiary banks have entered into agreements with their respective banking regulator primarily as a result of higher levels of nonperforming loans 
the agreements with these three bank subsidiaries require them  among other things  to increase and maintain future capital ratios in certain increments over the next two quarters 
although each of the subsidiary banks are considered well capitalized by historically established measures at december   banking authorities are increasingly requiring banks to maintain higher capital levels as a cushion for dealing with further deteriorating loan portfolios 
during the first quarter of the company received a million equity investment by the us department of treasury treasury as part of its capital purchase program 
the company issued to the treasury thousand shares of series a  no par cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  common shares at a price of 
the company put in motion a plan to improve its capital position toward the end of part of that plan includes reducing the quarterly common stock dividend announced during the fourth quarter of to 
per share from the previous amount of 
per share 
the company decided to forgo declaring dividends on its common stock entirely in the first quarter of for an undetermined time period 
the company also filed a registration statement on form s with the sec that became effective in the fourth quarter 
as part of that filing  equity securities of the company of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of million could be offered for sale in one or more public or private offerings at an appropriate time 
the company continues to explore potential capital raising scenarios 
however  no determination as to if or when a cap ital raise will be completed has been made 
net proceeds from a potential sale of securities under the registration statement could be used for any corporate purpose determined by the company s board of directors 
in january  the company named lloyd c

results of operations a one time  non cash  million after tax goodwill impairment charge led to a net loss for the twelve months ended december  of million or per common share compared to net income of million or 
per common share for the same twelve months of the million pretax goodwill impairment charge was recorded during the fourth quarter of and represents the entire amount of goodwill previously reported 
the goodwill impairment charge had a negative impact of per common share 
the impairment charge represents a one time accounting transaction that had no impact on cash flows  liquidity  or key regulatory capital ratios of the company or its bank subsidiaries 
the goodwill impairment charge was primarily the result of a prolonged decline in the stock price of the company  a situation similar to many of its peer banks and other financial institutions 
lower stock prices are mainly attributed to the continuing economic weaknesses and increased market concern surrounding the credit risk and capital positions of financial institutions 
other significant factors impacting net income in the annual comparison include the following the provision for loan losses increased million in the current twelve months compared to a year ago 
net interest income decreased million or due mainly to lower interest on earning assets  primarily loans  which were negatively impacted by higher nonaccrual loans and loans that have repriced downward 
net interest margin was in the current twelve months  a decrease of basis points from in the prior year twelve months 
net interest spread decreased basis points to from driven mainly by the loan portfolio 
noninterest income in the current year increased million or 
the increase is mainly due to the impact of the other than temporary impairment otti charge recorded during related to the company s investment in preferred stocks of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association collectively  the gse s 
this non cash transaction reduced noninterest income during by million 
noninterest income for was also positively impacted by a million increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities 
the million increase in noninterest expense is mainly attributed to the one time  non cash goodwill million pre tax impairment charge previously discussed along with an increase in deposit insurance expense of million 
the increase in deposit insurance expense is due in part to the special assessment imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation during the current year as part of its plan to replenish the deposit insurance fund 
the company was able to offset a portion of its deposit insurance expense in the prior year with a one time assessment credit it received during the million increase in income tax benefit is due mainly to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
a portion of the company s previously recorded goodwill was created in taxable business combinations and therefore was able to record a tax benefit of million attributed to the impairment charge 
return on assets roa was in  a decrease of basis points from 
for the prior year end 
the goodwill impairment charge  provision for loan losses  and net interest margin contributed basis points  basis points  and basis points  respectively to lower roa in the comparison 
these negative effects were partially offset by basis points higher noninterest income as a percentage of average assets and a benefit of basis points attributed to income taxes 
return on equity roe for was compared to for the lower roe is mainly attributed to the million net loss for the year 
interest income interest income results from interest earned on earning assets  which primarily include loans and investment securities 
interest income is affected by volume average balance  composition of earning assets  and the related rates earned on those assets 
total interest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the previous year 
interest income decreased across nearly all major earning asset categories and was driven primarily by lower average rates earned 
the company s tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for interest and fees earned on loans was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million a year earlier 
the decline in interest and fees on loans is due mainly to a basis point lower average rate earned  which offset a slight increase of million or 
in average loans outstanding in the comparable period 
the lower average rate earned on loans is reflective of competitive and economic pressures impacting the pricing of new loans and variable rate loans that have in the aggregate adjusted downward upon their repricing interval 
restructured loans  which often include rate concessions made to the borrower  were million at year end and had a negative impact on interest income 
an increase in the average balance outstanding of nonaccrual loans have also contributed to the decrease in interest income on loans in the comparison 
the tax equivalent yield on loans was for compared to for interest on taxable investment securities was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million a year ago 
the decrease is primarily rate driven and reflects a basis point decline in the average rate earned in to from in a million or increase in volume partially offset the impact from the lower average rate earned in the comparison 
the decrease in the average rate earned is mainly due to principal prepayments received on mortgaged backed securities and other called or sold bonds 
the proceeds from these payments were reinvested at rates that were lower than their original book yield 
a large portion of these investments had originally been made during periods of higher rates  prior to the dramatic reductions in overall market interest rates that took place in the fourth quarter of interest on nontaxable investment securities was million for  an increase of thousand or compared to and was driven by an increase in the average balance outstanding of million or 
average balances outstanding increased as a result of improved interest rate spreads available in the market as compared to other taxable alternatives 
interest income from short term temporary investments  which include time deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  decreased thousand or due to a lower average rate earned 
the average rate earned on temporary investments for was  a decrease of basis points compared to for the lower average rate earned is consistent with the available short term market yields  particularly that of the federal funds rate  which began at before falling sharply to near zero percent by year end and remained at that level throughout interest expense interest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities  which include interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other short and long term borrowed funds 
interest expense is affected by volume  composition of interest bearing liabilities  and the related rates paid on those liabilities 
total interest expense was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense decreased mainly as a result of a lower average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  particularly on deposits  in an overall lower interest rate environment 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for the downward trend in interest expense for closely resembles the trend for interest income  particularly for shorter term deposits and borrowing agreements 
the federal funds rate was at the beginning of it fell to near zero percent by the end of and remained at that level for all of new deposits and other borrowing arrangements as well as the repricing of existing deposits and borrowings at lower market interest rates  particularly for shorter term instruments  resulted in overall lower interest expense in the comparable periods 
interest expense on deposit accounts declined million or in the annual comparison 
the decrease in interest expense on deposits was led by lower interest on time deposits of million or 
although average time deposits increased by million  an basis point lower average rate paid of more than offset the higher average outstanding balances 
interest expense on savings and interest bearing demand deposits decreased million or and million or in compared to the decrease in interest expense on savings and interest bearing demand accounts were largely driven by lower average rates paid of basis points and basis points  respectively and  to a smaller extent  lower average balances outstanding 
interest expense on short term and long term borrowing decreased million or and thousand or  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense on borrowings was due mainly to lower average rates paid and  in the case of short term borrowings  a lower average outstanding balance in compared to a year ago 
the average rate paid on short term borrowings was 
for  a decrease of basis points compared to for average outstanding balances for short term borrowings declined million or in primarily related to reductions in federal funds purchased transactions pertaining to correspondent banking activities 
the average rate paid on long term borrowings was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets 
the two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread represents the difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  which are also available to fund earning assets 
 changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and the composition of earning assets  their related yields  and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and the average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin 
the table that follows represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
tax equivalent net interest income was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the net interest margin was  a decrease of basis points from in the prior year 
net interest spread accounted for basis points of the lower net interest margin and was for compared to for the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funds negatively impacted net interest margin by basis points in the comparison 
the effect of noninterest bearing sources of funds on net interest margin typically decreases as the average cost of funds declines 
during  the company s tax equivalent yield on total earning assets was  a decrease of basis points from for the average cost of funds was  a decrease of basis points compared to for this resulted in a net interest spread of and for year ends and as discussed above 
the company expects its net interest margin to remain relatively flat or increase slightly in the near term according to internal modeling using expectations about future market interest rates  the maturity structure of the company s earning assets and liabilities  and other factors 
future results could be significantly different than expectations 
net interest income for includes million related to the company s balance sheet leverage transaction that took place during the fourth quarter of this represents a decrease of thousand or compared to million for the leverage transaction  while positively impacting net interest income and net income  trimmed net interest margin by basis points and basis points for and  respectively 
the company continues to actively monitor and proactively manage the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment 
this task has become increasingly more difficult following the extreme market disruptions and economic downturn that began in competition in the company s market areas continues to be intense 
the overall interest rate environment remains low by historical measures 
the federal reserve has kept its short term federal funds target rate near zero percent since mid december current data suggests  however  that the federal funds target rate may begin to tick upwards beginning in yields on treasury securities of medium and longer term maturity structures have experienced increases already 
for instance  two and ten year treasury notes and bonds increased basis points and basis points at year end compared to year end the prime interest rate  which has a significant impact on the company s interest income on loans  has moved in a manner similar to that of the short term federal funds rate 
the prime rate was to begin  falling basis points to by year end where it remained throughout all of predicting the movement of future interest rates is uncertain 
during  the average rates for two of the most significant components of net interest income for the company  loans and time deposits  both declined 
as previously noted  the average rate earned on the company s loan portfolio declined basis points to during the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in the year to year comparison 
should interest rates on the company s earning assets and interest paying li abilities reprice lower  the company s yield on earning assets could potentially decrease faster than its cost of funds 
should interest rates reprice higher  the company s cost of funds may also increase and could continue to increase faster than the yields on earning assets  resulting in a lower net interest margin

noninterest income noninterest income for was million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
the increase in noninterest income in the comparison was primarily the result of the million non cash otti charge related to the company s gse preferred stock investments that was recorded as a reduction in noninterest income in the third quarter of and an additional thousand realized loss on the sale of its gse investments in the fourth quarter of excluding the securities transactions related to the gse investments  noninterest income increased million or in the annual comparison 
net securities gains were million for  an increase of million compared to net securities losses of thousand for the net loss from the sale of investment securities during includes a thousand loss on the sale of the company s gse investments during the fourth quarter 
higher net securities gains in is a result of an increase in sales activity and continuing refinements to the securities portfolio to be in better position going forward 
net gains on the sale of loans were million for  an increase of thousand or compared to due to higher sales volume that have been boosted by a low interest rate environment and consumer refinancing activity 
allotment processing fees were million for  an increase of thousand or due to higher processing volumes 
da ta processing fees jumped thousand or in to million 
the increase in data processing fees are primarily related to higher transaction volumes from the commonwealth of kentucky and an upward trend in processing unemployment related items 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts were million for this represents a decrease of thousand or compared to million for the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was driven by lower nsf fees of thousand and experienced throughout most of the company s market areas as a result of lower volumes 
trust income decreased thousand or  due mainly to an overall decline in managed account balances  which serves as a key part of the revenue base for collecting fees on these accounts 
noninterest expense total noninterest expenses were million for  an increase of million or compared to million for the sharp increase in noninterest expense in is attributed to a million one time  non cash goodwill impairment charge and a million increase in deposit insurance 
the million goodwill impairment charge was recorded during the fourth quarter of as a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment testing 
during the annual impairment testing  the company concluded that as a result of continuing economic weaknesses and heightened market concern surrounding the credit risk and capital position of financial institutions  the fair value of the company s single reporting unit would more likely than not be below its carrying amount 
the company engaged an independent third party to assist with its goodwill impairment analysis and determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill was significantly less than the carrying value resulting in the non cash impairment charge 
the million increase in deposit insurance expense in compared to is due in part to a special assessment imposed by the fdic during as part of its plan to replenish the deposit insurance fund 
the special assessment accounted for million of the increase in deposit insurance for the current year 
in addition  deposit insurance expense for was low as a result of the company s ability to offset a portion of its expense with a one time assessment credit it received during there are no credits remaining to offset future assessments 
significant increases in other noninterest expense line items include net other real estate expenses of million and net occupancy expense of thousand or 
the increase in net other real estate expenses correlates with the million higher net amount of foreclosed real estate properties held by the company at year end compared to year end expenses relating to these properties generally include amounts to prepare the properties for resale and  in some cases  impairment charges to write down a property s book value to its fair value less estimated costs to sell as determined by appraisal 
the increase in net occupancy expense in compared to is mainly attributed to higher depreciation and rent 
depreciation and rent is up mainly as a result of the timing of several new buildings put into service during whereby less than a full year of expense related to these buildings was recognized in that year 
depreciation expense in also includes the acceleration of thousand on leasehold improvements recognized upon the termination of a leased property 
significant decreases in noninterest expense include amortization of intangible assets of thousand or and salaries and employee benefits of thousand or 
amortization of intangible assets  which relate to customer lists and core deposits from prior acquisitions  is decreasing as a result of amortization schedules that allocate a higher amount of amortization in the earlier periods following an acquisition consistent with how the assets are used 
the decrease in salaries and employee benefits correlates with a lower average number of full time equivalent employees  which were for compared to for salary and related payroll taxes decreased thousand or consistent with lower head count 
benefit costs increased thousand or due to higher claims related to the company s self fund ed insurance plan 
all other noninterest expenses decreased million  net 
the net decrease represents numerous line items of relatively small amounts as the company attempts to better manage and reduce overall costs along all line items 
the largest decline in this group of accounts represents lower advertising expenses in the amount of thousand 
income tax the company recorded an income tax benefit for of million compared to a benefit of million for the million increase in the income tax benefit recorded in is due mainly to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
a portion of the company s previously recorded goodwill was created in taxable business combinations and therefore it was able to record a tax benefit of million attributed to the impairment charge in for  the income tax benefit was mainly attributed to the losses associated with the gse preferred stock investments in the third and fourth quarters of financial condition total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million or from the prior year end 
the decrease in assets is primarily related to the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of and a million decrease in loans outstanding net of unearned income and allowance for loan losses 
these amounts were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents of million or and investment securities of million or 
the increase in current end of period cash and cash equivalents compared to year end was driven by the cash raised from the preferred stock issued to the treasury during the first quarter of and to the overall net funding position of the company 
the company maintains a cautious and measured lending strategy with tighter loan underwriting standards as it and many of its customers continue to deal with the effects of one of the most severe recessions in many decades 
while economic data is beginning to improve by some measures  the overall economy continues to show weaknesses  particularly the high level of unemployment and lower overall real estate values 
total liabilities were billion at december   a decrease of million or 
compared to december  net deposits increased million or while net borrowed funds decreased million or 
shareholders equity declined million or to million at year end due mainly to the net loss for the year partially offset by the additional capital raised from the company s issuance of million of preferred stock to the treasury 
management of the company considers it noteworthy to understand the relationship between the company s principal subsidiary  farmers bank  and the commonwealth of kentucky 
farmers bank provides various services to state agencies of the commonwealth 
as the depository for the commonwealth  checks are drawn on farmers bank by these agencies  which include paychecks and state income tax refunds 
farmers bank also processes vouchers of the wic women  infants and children program for the cabinet for human resources 
the bank s investment department also provides services to the teachers retirement system 
as the depository for the commonwealth  large fluctuations in deposits are likely to occur on a daily basis 
therefore  reviewing average balances is important to understand ing the financial condition of the company as daily deposit balances fluctuate significantly as a result of the farmers bank s relationship with the commonwealth 
on an average basis  total assets were billion for  an increase of million or from the increase in average assets is attributed mainly to higher earning asset balances of million or

the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
subprime mortgage lending is defined by the company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay 
the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  is summarized in the table below

interest sensitivity fixed variable in thousands rate rate due after one but within five years due after five years total asset quality the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio  limiting exposure to any single customer or industry  rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria  and collateral requirements 
the company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner 
this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs loan rev iews at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable incurred loan losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using a risk rated methodology 
many factors are considered when estimating the allowance 
these include  but are not limited to  past loan loss experience  an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors 
allocations o f the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the risk rated methodology includes segregating watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating specific reserves to these loans depending on their status 
for example  watch list loans  which may be identified by the internal loan review risk rating system or by regulatory examiner classification  are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due days or more are assigned a different loss percentage 
each of these percentages considers past experience as well as current factors 
the remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into three components having similar risk characteristics as follows commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate loans 
each of these components is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective three year historical loss percentage 
additional allocatio ns to the allowance may then be made for subjective factors  such as those mentioned above  as determined by senior managers who are knowledgeable about these matters 
during  the company further identified signs of deterioration in certain real estate development loans that continued into and and specific allowances related to these loans were recorded 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on the information currently available  additional adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in the factors noted above 
borrowers may experience difficulty in periods of economic deterioration  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require additional increases in the provision 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews could result in additional adjustments to the provision based upon their judgments about relevant information available during their examination 
in general  the provision for loan losses and related allowance increases as the level of nonperforming and impaired loans  as a percentage of net loans outstanding  increases 
the company s allowance for loan loss amount has heavily considered past loan loss experience to estimate current loan losses  but it also considers current trends within the portfolio that may not be indicative of past charge off levels 
adjustments are made to the allowance for loan losses as needed when such matters are identified 
although net charge offs spiked upward during  the upward trend in net charge offs during our three year look back period have been relatively low 
significant weaknesses in the general economy  particularly a softer housing market combined with significant credit tightening throughout the financial services industry beg an in overall economic conditions  including widespread illiquidity and extreme volatility in financial markets  higher unemployment rates  and other unprecedented market conditions  continued to worsen in and into before beginning to stabilize toward the end of unemployment remains high 
these economic conditions resulted in significant stress primarily in the company s residential real estate development and commercial real estate sectors of its lending portfolio 
as such  the company increased its allowance amounts for real estate development and commercial real estate lending in consideration of these current factors  even though historic net charge offs have been relatively low 
for loans that are currently impaired  defined as loans in which the company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms  the company expects to recover significantly all of the principal amounts outstanding based on collateral values obtained from independent appraisals 
this has resulted in the amount of nonperforming and impaired loans that have increased disproportionately with the related allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
collateral values are updated as warranted by periodically obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area 
the provision for loan losses was million in  an increase of million compared to million for the increase in the provision for loan losses reflects a higher level of nonperforming loans  primarily nonaccrual and restructured loans that have trended upward as the overall economic environment and certain customers ability to repay their loans have deteriorated 
nonperforming loans were million at december  compared to million at december  this represents a net increase of million 
although the company is beginning to see an increase in the number of smaller balance credits showing signs of deterioration  a significant amount of the increase in nonperforming loans is attributed to a relatively small number of larger balance credits 
nine individual larger balance credit s totaling million in the aggregate were added to nonperforming status during  million of which is secured by real estate developments and the remaining million secured by commercial real estate 
total net charge offs for the company were million for and were as follows real estate lending million  lease financing million  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans million  and installment loans thousand 
net charge offs increased million in compared to as follows real estate lending million  lease financing million  commercial  financial  and agriculture thousand or  and installment loans thousand or 
net charge offs in were largely driven by lower real estate values along with slower sales and excess inventory primarily related to loans secured by real estate developments 
the decline in real estate values is attributed to the overall economic downturn that began in which has yet to fully stabilize 
the increase in net charg e offs for lease financing was driven by a single charge off in resulting from fraudulent transactions on the part of a lease customer

investment securities on page nonperforming assets nonperforming assets for the company include nonperforming loans  other real estate owned  and other foreclosed assets 
nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans past due ninety days or more on which interest is still accruing 
generally  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans occur when a lender grants a concession to a financially troubled borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
such concessions may include a reduction of the stated interest rate on a debt  extensions of the maturity date  or a reduction of accrued interest  among other s 
nonperforming assets totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at year end nonperforming assets have trended upward mainly as a result of ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain the company and many of its customers  particularly real estate development lending 
nonaccrual loans were million at december   up million or compared to year end there are sixteen nonaccrual credits greater than million with an aggregate outstanding balance of million included in the nonaccrual total at year end  including twelve credits totaling million secured by real estate development projects 
interest income reversed from earnings from loans placed on nonaccrual status in was million 
the reversal of interest income reduced the yield on earning assets  net interest spread  and net interest margin by basis points in restructured loans that are in compliance with their modified terms were million at december  this amount is made up primarily of four credits  two with a total outstanding balance of million secured by real estate developments and two totaling million secured by commercial real estate properties 
other real estate owned oreo was million at year end  an increase of million or 
the increase in oreo is due mainly to the company taking possession of three larger balance commercial real estate properties totaling million and two larger balance real estate developments totaling million during each of these properties previously served as collateral for extensions of credit 
of the larger balance commercial real estate properties transferred to oreo during  million was classified as nonaccrual loans at year end nonperforming loans were of loans net of unearned income at year end this represents an increase of basis points compared to at year end and is attributed to the higher nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as discussed above 
nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets are presented in the table below 
december  in thousands loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets the company maintains a comprehensive risk grading and loan review program  which includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans  review delinquencies  assess loans for needed charge offs  and placement on non accrual status 
the company had loans in the amount of million and at year end and  respectively  which are currently performing but are considered potential problem loans that are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the table above 
these loans  however  are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the increase in the balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain the company and many of its customers  particularly real estate development lending 
po tential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by real estate  with the single largest relationship totaling million 
at december  the five largest potential problem credits were million in the aggregate and secured by various types of real estate including commercial  construction properties  and residential real estate development 
potential problem loans are identified on the company s watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management and are not necessarily considered classified credits by regulators 
credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable  such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower 
potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower s ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment  deterioration in a borrower s financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements  a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan  or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates 
the company incorporates its potential problem loans into the calculation of its allowance for loan losses using a risk rated methodology 
certain loans on the company s watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans were established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance 
temporary investments temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   temporary investments were million  an increase of million or compared to million at year end temporary investments averaged million during  an increase of million or from the increase is a result of the company s overall net funding position  which reflects a more conservative lending approach as the company works through its high level of nonperforming assets in a difficult economy 
temporary investments are reallocated to loans or other investments as market conditions and company resources warrant 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of debt securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  mortgage backed securities  and tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions 
substantially all of the company s investment securities are designated as available for sale 
total investment securities were million on december   an increase of million or compared to million at year end net amortized cost amounts increased million or 
net unrealized gains related to investments in the available for sale portfolio increased million or 
the increase in amortized cost amounts of investment securities is attributed to net purchase activity during the million overall increase in net unrealized gains for available for sale investment securities is attributed mainly to a million increase in the market value of the company s corporate debt securities 
net unrealized losses on corporate debt securities were million at year end compared to a net unrealized loss of million at year end corporate debt securities consist primarily of single issuer trust preferred capital securities issued by national and global financial services firms 
each of these securities are currently performing and the issuers of these securities are rated as investment grade by major rating agencies  even though down grades have occurred with respect to certain securities within this group of holdings during the first half of the unrealized loss on corporate debt securities is primarily attributed to the general decline in financial markets and temporary illiquidity and not due to adverse changes in the expected cash flows of the individual securities 
overall market declines  particularly of banking and financial institutions  are a result of significant stress throughout the regional and national economy that occurred during  that  while improving  has not fully stabilized 
the gradual improvement in many overall economic measures has resulted in higher market values of these securities for market values of the remaining available for sale investment securities decreased million and is attributed to the timing and change in market interest rates 
overall market interest rates increased incrementally during as reflected in the yield curves  particularly that of longer term maturity structures 
market values of fixed rate investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates 
unrealized losses on the company s investment securities portfolio at year end have not been included in income since they are identified as temporary 
the fair values of these securities are expected to recover as they approach their maturity dates 
the company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery 
the c ompany does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors 
funds made available from sold  maturing or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth  reinvested to purchase additional investment securities  or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
the following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on december    and the investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at the estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost

the weighted average tax rates on exempt states and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
deposits the company s primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits  which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand  savings  and time deposits 
on december  total deposits were billion  an increase of million or from year end interest bearing deposits were up million or to billion and noninterest bearing deposits decreased million or to million 
the increase in interest bearing deposits was driven mainly by a million or increase in time deposits 
the decrease in end of period noninterest bearing deposits was driven by lower balances from the commonwealth of million  which offset a million net increase in other noninterest bearing deposit account balances 
balances related to the commonwealth can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
average total deposits were billion for  an increase of million or compared to average year end balances 
average time deposits increased million or which offset an million or decrease in average interest bearing demand account balances and a million or decrease in average savings account balances 
average noninterest bearing deposit balances were million for  up million or 
the company has experienced an increase in time deposits that it perceives to be mainly a result of customers that have moved money out of a volatile stock market and into more stable investments such as certificate of deposits 
the company also believes that increased deposit insurance coverage generally up to thousand has had a net positive impact on outstanding balances

a summary of short term borrowings is as follows 
in thousands amount outstanding at year end maximum outstanding at any month end average outstanding weighted average rate at year end weighted average rate during the year long term borrowings the company s long term borrowings consist mainly of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb advances  and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent long term obligations whereby the company borrowed approximately million in multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements with an initial weighted average cost of 
the borrowings mature in various amounts and time periods as follows million in november  million in november  and million in november the borrowings have a weighted average remaining maturity of years 
at december  million of the borrowings are putable quarterly and the remaining million is putable quarterly beginning in the fourth quarter of the company used the proceeds f rom the borrowing to purchase a like amount of fixed rate gnma bonds 
the gnma bonds have a current weighted average yield of and an estimated weighted average remaining life of years 
fhlb advances to the company s subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of fhlb stock that banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the fhlb 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  which have their own interest rates and range of maturities 
interest rates on fhlb advances are generally fixed and range between and  with a weighted average rate of  and remaining maturities of up to years 
long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb totaling million are convertible to a floating interest rate 
these advances may convert to a floating interest rate indexed to three month libor only if libor equals or exceeds 
at year end  the three month libor was 
fhlb advances are generally used to increase the company s lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the fhlb 
long term advances from the fhlb totaled million at december   a decrease of million or from year end the company has previously completed three private offerings of trust preferred securities through three separate delaware statutory trusts the trusts sponsored by the company in the aggregate amount of million 
the combined million proceeds from the first two trusts trusts i and ii established in were used to fund the acquisition of citizens bancorp 
proceeds from the third trust trust iii were used primarily to acquire company shares through a tender offer during the company owns all of the common securities of each of the three trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  plus capital of million contributed by the company to establish the trusts  to purchase the company s subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii mature in and bear a floating interest rate at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion of the total and at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion 
the subordinated notes of trust iii in the amount of million mature in and bear a fixed interest rate through of and then convert to floating thereafter at three month libor plus basis points 
interest on each of the notes is payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after september  the subordinated notes of trust iii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after november  the subordinated notes are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
at december   the aggregate balance of the subordinated notes payable to the trusts was million 
the weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in was  a decrease of basis points compared to for contractual obligations the company is contractually obligated to make payments as follows

long term fhlb debt  subordinated notes payable  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption 
long term borrowings above and in 
note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest 
postretirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next years 
estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions 
capital lease obligations represent amounts relating to th e acquisition of data processing hardware and software used in the company s operations 
operating leases include standard business equipment used in the company s day to day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites 
operating lease terms generally range from one to five years  with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the company s option 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
guarantees during  the parent company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of its bank subsidiaries in connection with the million balance sheet leverage transaction 
the amount of borrowings outstanding guaranteed by the parent company at december  was million  with various maturity dates ranging from two to eight years 
the million outstanding borrowings are secured by gnma bonds held by the parent company s subsidiary banks valued at of the outstanding borrowings or million 
should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement  the gnma bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due 
if the value of the gnma bonds fall below the obligation under the contract  the parent company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks ability to do so 
the parent company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the parent company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement 
effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the com pany s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company has a corporate asset and liability management committee alco 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
alco also provides guidance and support to each alco of the company s subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company wide basis 
alco has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt 
however  the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the corporate policy 
the company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure 
the model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates during the next twelve months 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes  including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities 
other assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected prepayments  projected new volume  and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances 
these effects are combined with the company s estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast f or the next twelve months 
the forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and net income 
because assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income 
actual results could differ significantly from simulated results 
at december   the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would increase and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
the model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would decrease and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
in the current relatively low interest rate environment  it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets 
the average rate paid on many of the company s deposits is below 
this situation magnifies the model s predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates  as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower rate deposits 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
for financial institutions  liquidity reflects the ability to meet loan demand  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities 
a financial institution s ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company s goal is to meet its near term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset liability management 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
the c ompany s alcos  both at the bank subsidiary level and on a consolidated basis  meet regularly and monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds include the subsidiary banks core deposits  consisting of both business and nonbusiness deposits  cash flow generated by repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities  fhlb and other borrowings  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage p repayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition in our local markets 
as of december   the company had million in additional borrowing capacity under various fhlb  federal funds  and other borrowing agreements 
however  there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the company  or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity  although the company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the company s liquidity from these sources 
the parent company previously had a one year million unsecured line of credit with an unrelated financial institution available for general corporate purposes 
this line of credit had no outstanding balance when it matured in june the company uses a liquidity ratio to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs 
this ratio is monitored by alco at both the bank level and on a consolidated basis 
the liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds 
this measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results 
for example  a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the company s ability to fund loans might become more difficult 
a high liquidity ratio could indicate that the company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets  which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties 
the company s liquidity position was higher at year end compared to year end and remains within alco guidelines and co nsidered by management to be at an adequate level 
the increase in the company s liquidity measure at year end is attributed mainly to higher overall short term investments  which have risen while the company has taken a measured and cautious lending strategy in an economic environment that remains challenging 
the increase in liquidity is also a by product of the regulatory agreements that were entered into during by certain bank subsidiaries of the company 
at the parent company level  liquidity is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see 
note regulatory matters of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  cash balances maintained  and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources 
the parent company s primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  repurchasing its common stock from time to time  business acquisitions  interest expense on borrowings  and paying for general operating expenses 
due to recent regulatory agreements  dividend payments on the parent company s common and preferred stock and interest payments on its trust preferred borrowings must have regulatory approval before being paid 
during the fourth quarter of  t he parent company declared a dividend on its common stock of 
per share  a decrease from 
per share in an effort to preserve capital 
the company further cut the dividend on its common stock when it announced in the first quarter of that it would forgo a dividend declaration 
the parent company was granted permission by its regulators to declare and pay its preferred stock dividend and make interest payments on its trust preferred borrowings through the first quarter of the last time such approval was requested by the company

the primary source of funds for the parent company is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks  cash balances maintained  investments in company owned life insurance  and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources 
payment of dividends by the company s subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations 
at december  each of the company s bank subsidiaries were required to obtain regulatory approval before declaring or paying a dividend to the parent company 
two of the company s subsidiary banks need regulatory approval due to statutory restrictions on the amount of distributions that can be made relative to undistributed net income over a period that includes the current year to date period and the previous two calendar years 
th e company expects to receive dividends in from either or both of these subsidiary banks 
the company s remaining three subsidiary banks need regulatory approval to declare or pay dividends as a result of increased capital required in connection with recent regulatory exams

at december   consolidated liquid assets were million  an increase of million or from year end the increase in liquid assets is mainly attributed to million higher net cash and equivalents and an increase in available for sale investment securities of million 
the increase in cash and equivalents is due mainly to an overall increase in deposits  lower loan balances outstanding  and the overall funding position of the company  which changes as loan demand  deposit levels  and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate 
the increase in available for sale investments securities is a result of net purchases during and a decrease in funding for loans

the payment included an estimated quarterly risk based assessment for the fourth quarter of and for all of   and united bank requested and was granted a waiver and was not required to make prepayment under the plan 
earnings were not immediately impacted when payment was made since the cash payment was accounted for as a prepayment and recorded as an asset 
rather  earnings will be impacted over a three year period as the company records an expense for its regular quarterly assessment with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset until the asset is exhausted 
information relating to off balance sheet arrangements is disclosed in
