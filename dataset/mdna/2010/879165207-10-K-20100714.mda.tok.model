general management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the company together with its subsidiary 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes  and with the critical accounting policies noted below 
the company s fiscal year begins on april and ends on march unless otherwise noted  all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the company s fiscal year ending on march during the last few years  the company won competitively three major contracts craft ramp test set and itats bench test set from the us navy  and the ts a upgrade from the us army 
these units employ tel s new generation technology  technology which is expected to give tel a competitive edge in the market for many years to come  and which will be the basis of new competitive products 
the three contracts represent potential revenues of approximately million over the next several years  depending on the number of production options exercised by the military see item  description of business 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in recent months there have been delays in production orders under these contracts and increased engineering costs incurred in connection with these new products 
in addition  there have been costs incurred in connection with litigation commenced by a competitor see item  pending litigation 
fiscal was challenging due to the substantial decline in revenues  as a result of the delay in production orders  and the investment of a record million in engineering costs 
the development of two of the three new key products has been substantially completed  and both products are currently undergoing evaluation by the us navy 
in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  the company completed shipment of an order for craft pilot production units an usm and an usm that was received in november the navy has indicated that additional substantial pilot production orders for these units could be issued in the near term 
upon successful completion of navy technical evaluation for the an usm  it is our expectation that the navy will fully exercise its remaining production options for craft test sets this fiscal year 
the itats an arm tacan test set is currently in navy technical evaluation with production orders for units expected to be released later this fiscal year 
the company has already received million of delivery orders for the ts a and the company plans to deliver units to the army in the second quarter of this fiscal year that will be used for testing and product evaluation purposes 
as a result  tel anticipates record revenues and a return to solid profitability in the current fiscal year 
on february  the company won a five year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract with the us air force with a maximum value of million for yet another product  the tr tacan test set 
the company continues to bid on military solicitations where the company believes it has a technical or cost advantage 
at march  the company s backlog was approximately million as compared to approximately million at march  the backlog at march  includes only the amount of currently exercised delivery orders on open idiq indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts  and the company s backlog is expected to materially increase when the large volume production orders for the an usm  an usm  and an arm units are received 
as a result of the decline in revenues and the increased engineering costs discussed above  the company s working capital and cash flow substantially declined in fiscal year the company raised approximately  in additional equity and debt financing in fiscal year to support this intensive engineering effort 
the company will require additional capital to support its aggressive growth plans and is currently in discussions with several parties to secure additional financing and expects to receive additional financing on acceptable terms see liquidity and capital resources below 
the company also has a line of credit from a bank  which expires october  the agreement includes a borrowing base calculation tied to accounts receivable and inventories with a maximum availability of  at march  the company had outstanding balances of  and borrowed an additional  in the first quarter of fiscal year as of march   the remaining availability under this line was approximately  based upon receivables and inventories at march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued on june   the company entered into a non binding term sheet with a private lender  providing that the company and the lender would negotiate an agreement for a five year loan to the company for million at an interest rate of per year 
the nonbinding term sheet provides for additional terms to be included in the agreement  usual to these kinds of agreements  including a provision for warrants to the lender to purchase common shares at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the common shares on the nyse amex at the date of the closing of the loan agreement 
in the event of certain major corporate events  the lender would have the right to require the company to purchase the warrant or warrant shares at prices related to the market price of the shares or related to the company s operating income 
any final agreement will have other provisions negotiated by the parties 
although no assurance can be given  the company is reasonably confident that an acceptable agreement can be concluded in the next days 
in december  the kansas court dismissed the aeroflex civil suit against the company 
while this decision was based primarily on jurisdictional issues  the ruling did note that aeroflex  after discovery proceedings  did not provide any evidence that tel or its employees misappropriated aeroflex trade secrets 
the kansas ruling also referenced the army s findings  in its response to the general accountability office gao  which rejected aeroflex s claims and determined that tel used its own proprietary technology on this program 
aeroflex has elected to appeal this kansas decision and has agreed to stay any action against the two former employees until a decision is reached 
tel remains confident as to the outcome of this appeal 
see item  pending legal proceedings 
results of operations compared to sales for the fiscal year ended march   total sales decreased  to  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
avionics government sales decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in government sales is primarily attributed to a decrease in shipments of the t n  t d  tr  t as well as sales associated with the itats  which are recognized on a percentage of completion as the initial phase of the programs nears completion 
additionally  the prior fiscal year included a negotiated billing to the government in the amount of  for additional work previously performed and expensed on the craft program as well as increased billings for revenues associated with t he test and documentation phase of the craft program 
government sales have been impacted by delays in the receipt of several expected large orders as well as delays in the completion of two of its major programs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of the tr avionics commercial sales decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease in sales is the result of the continued weak financial condition of the commercial airline industry 
revenues associated with the marine systems business declined as this business has been discontinued 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued gross margin gross margin decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to the decrease in volume 
the gross margin percentage for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross margin dollars and percentage is also attributed to a negotiated billing in the prior fiscal year to the government in the amount of  for additional work previously performed and expensed on the craft program 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase is attributed mainly to an increase in legal fees k associated with the litigation see item  pending legal proceedings  and professional fees k offset partially by lower outside commissions k and marketing consultant fees k 
engineering  research and development expenses increased  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
engineering  research and development expenses are mostly attributed to engineering costs related to the ts a and craft programs 
interest  net interest income decreased as a result of lower average cash balances 
interest expense increased as a result of the cumulative increased borrowings and higher interest rate associated with the line of credit

net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  due to the decrease in purchases of equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to proceeds from the sale of new common stock  the exercise of stock options  and issuance of subordinated notes payable 
at march  the company s backlog stood at approximately million as compared to approximately million at march  the backlog at march  includes only the amount of currently exercised delivery orders on open idiq indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts  and is expected to materially increase when the volume production orders for the navy craft an usm and the itats an arm products are received 
historically  the company obtains a substantial volume of orders which are required to be filled in less than twelve months  and  therefore  these anticipated orders are not reflected in the backlog 
approximately million in orders of the march  backlog is related to the ts a program 
the company raised  of capital from directors  through a combination of sales of new shares at market and the exercise of previously granted stock options   from the exercise of employee stock options from other employers  and  from two of its executive officers in exchange for subordinated notes payable in february each officer also received  stock options at per share  the market price at the date of grant see note to the financial statements

on certain government contracts the company has been granted progress payments from the government  which allows the company to bill and collect a portion of its incurred costs on long term programs before shipment of units  thus helping to fund the costs of these programs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued on june   the company entered into a non binding term sheet with a private lender  providing that the company and the lender would negotiate an agreement for a five year loan to the company for million at an interest rate of per year 
the nonbinding term sheet provides for additional terms to be included in the agreement  usual to these kinds of agreements  including a provision for warrants to the lender to purchase common shares at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the common shares on the nyse amex at the date of the closing of the loan agreement 
in the event of certain major corporate events  the lender would have the right to require the company to purchase the warrant or warrant shares at prices related to the market price of the shares or related to the company s operating income 
any final agreement will have other provisions negotiated by the parties 
although no assurance can be given  the company is reasonably confident that an acceptable agreement can be concluded in the next days 
there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  the company applies its accounting policies as disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer  provided title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
revenues on repairs and calibrations are recognized at the time the repaired or calibrated unit is shipped  as it is at this time that the work is completed 
due to the unique nature of the itats program wherein a significant portion of this contract will not be delivered for over a year  revenues under this contract are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
revenues and profits are estimated using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenues are recognized and profits recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to our estimate of total costs at completion 
the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion is applied to the contract value to determine the revenues and profits 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adj ustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
the company also receives progress billings on this program  which is a funding mechanism by the government to assist contractors on long term contracts prior to delivery 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as revenue  and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold 
payments received prior to the delivery of units or services performed are recorded as deferred revenues 
inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
while such write downs have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
for the year ended march  approximately of the company s sales were to the us government 
while such cred it losses have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
income taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are taxable only when the valuation change is realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expecte d to reverse 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit which is not more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  future taxable income is estimated  considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event it was determined that the company would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if it were determined that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  tel would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
 in its evaluation of a valuation allowance the company takes into account existing contracts and backlog  and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products 
the company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic for separating consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
it establishes a hierarchy of selling prices to determine the selling price of each specific deliverable which includes vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither of the first two are available 
this update also eliminates the residual method for allocating revenue between the elements of an arrangement and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement 
finally  this update expands the disclosure requirements regarding a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not anticipate any material impact from this update 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurements and disclosureswhich provides amendments to accounting standards codification fair value measurements and disclosures overall subtopic of the codification 
the update requires improved disclosures about fair value measurements 
separate disclosures need to be made of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements along with a description of the reasons for the transfers 
also  disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements needs to be made on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
the update also requires fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  and disclosures about t he valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements  which are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level activity disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the enhanced disclosure requirements have not had a material impact on the company s financial reporting
