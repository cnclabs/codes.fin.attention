overview we are a designer  marketer and distributor of innovative  action sports inspired products under the heelys brand targeted to the youth market 
our primary product  heelys wheeled footwear  is patented  dual purpose footwear that incorporates a stealth  removable wheel in the heel 
heelys wheeled footwear allows the user to seamlessly transition from walking or running to rolling by shifting weight to the heel 
users can transform heelys wheeled footwear into street footwear by removing the wheel 
in  approximately of our net sales was derived from the sale of our heelys wheeled footwear 
the remainder of our net sales was derived from the sale of non wheeled footwear and branded accessories  such as replacement wheels 
we introduced heelys wheeled footwear in  and for several years our domestic sales were concentrated with one large  national specialty retailer 
although we initially focused on driving our domestic sales growth  we also established relationships with independent distributors in japan  south korea and southeast asia 
as a result  the sources of our net sales were largely concentrated and we were susceptible to customer specific and region specific factors 
this concentration caused variability in our results of operations 
since that time  we have diversified our retail customer base in the united states by widening our distribution to include full line sporting goods retailers  specialty apparel and footwear retailers  select department stores  family footwear stores and select online retailers 
we have also expanded our international distribution channels to mitigate this concentration 
historically  our products have been sold to independent distributors with exclusive rights to specified international markets 
during the first quarter of  we opened an office in belgium to focus on expanding our international opportunities by working more closely with our distributors  establishing relationships with distributors in new international markets and  in select markets  selling our products direct to retail customers 
effective march  and april   respectively  we entered into agreements with our former distributor in germany and austria german market and our former distributor in france  monaco and andorra french market whereby we terminated their rights to distribute our products in their specified markets 
our belgian subsidiary took over the distribution of our products in the german market effective april  and in the french market effective may  
table of contents continued growth of our net sales will depend on consumer demand for heelys wheeled footwear and our ability to satisfy this demand 
a number of factors may impact consumer demand for our products  including general economic conditions  particularly changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns  the effectiveness of our marketing strategies  our ability to effectively distribute our products  our ability to design products that appeal to our target consumers  our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  and changes in the popularity of and participation in wheeled sports activities 
we intend to continue to diversify our product offering with new heelys wheeled footwear models in order to benefit from the recognition of our heelys brand 
designing  marketing and distributing new products will require us to devote additional resources to product development  marketing and operations 
these additional resources may include hiring new employees to support expansion in these areas and increasing amounts allocated to product advertising and promotion 
each of these additional resource commitments will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
because the selling price and unit cost of new products may differ from those of our existing products  sales of these new products may also impact our gross margin 
in addition  we may seek to selectively acquire new products and companies 
general net sales net sales represent primarily sales of heelys wheeled footwear  less an estimated reserve for sales returns  allowances including certain allowances for marketing  promotion and advertising support and discounts 
the remainder of our net sales was derived from the sale of non wheeled footwear and branded accessories  such as replacement wheels 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
we sell our products through distribution channels that generally merchandise our products in a manner that we believe enhances and protects our heelys brand image 
domestically  our products can be found in full line sporting goods retailers  specialty apparel and footwear retailers  select department stores  family footwear stores and select online retailers 
for  of our net sales were derived from domestic retail customers 
internationally  our products are sold primarily to independent distributors with exclusive rights to specified markets 
during the first quarter of  we opened an office in belgium to focus on expanding our international opportunities by working more closely with our distributors  establishing relationships with distributors in new international markets and  in select markets  selling our products direct to retail customers 
we took over the distribution of our products in germany and austria german market effective april  and in france  monaco and andorra french market effective may  in  our german and french markets accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
additionally  effective april   our subsidiary in belgium became responsible for sales to our independent distributors in emea europe  the middle east and africa 
sales to our customers in the german and french markets are denominated in euro 
sales to our independent distributors in the other emea countries are denominated in us dollars 
sales to our independent distributors in 
table of contents non emea markets continue to be processed at our office in carrollton  texas and denominated in us dollars 
payments are required to be made in the same currency as invoiced 
in  ag corporation  the company s independent distributor in japan  accounted for of our net sales  and oxylane group  a french sporting goods retail chain operating under the name decathlon  accounted for of our net sales 
no other retail customer or independent distributor accounted for or more of our net sales during cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales consists primarily of the cost to purchase finished products from our independent manufacturers 
cost of sales also includes inbound freight  royalty expenses related to licensed intellectual property  an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs and costs associated with operating our representative office in china 
we source all of our products from manufacturers located in china 
our product costs are largely driven by the prices we negotiate with our independent manufacturers 
each season  we negotiate a unit price for each model of heelys wheeled footwear 
factors that influence these prices include raw materials and labor costs and foreign exchange rates 
we believe our sourcing model allows us to minimize our capital investment  retain production flexibility  cost effectiveness and scalability inherent in the use of independent manufacturers and focus our resources on developing new products and enhancing our heelys brand image 
in january  we terminated our consulting agreement with our independent sourcing agent and opened a representative office in qingdao  china 
this office serves multiple sourcing functions  including quality control  price negotiation  logistics and product development 
when demand for our products slows  we may elect to discount our products to reduce our inventory  which causes our gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  to decline 
our gross margin is affected by our sourcing costs  our product mix and our ability to avoid excess inventory by accurately forecasting demand for our products 
the unit prices we charge our domestic and international retail customers are generally higher than we charge our independent distributors for similar products  because our independent distributors are responsible for distribution and marketing costs relating to our products 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we charge cost of sales for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would write down the inventory in the period in which we made such a determination and charge cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising costs  travel and insurance expenses  shipping and handling costs  product development costs  costs to enforce our intellectual property rights  depreciation  amortization  professional fees  facility expenses and costs associated with operating as a public company 
general accounting principles require the measurement of compensation cost of stock based compensation awards based on the estimated fair value of that award on the date of grant 
we recognize this compensation cost using the straight line method over the period during which the 
table of contents employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which the employee does not render the required service 
if the requisite service is not provided  all previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for all awards granted to date  the requisite service period is the same as the vesting period of the award 
our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we hire additional personnel  develop our infrastructure  increase our brand recognition through marketing  increase our product development efforts  secure and enforce our intellectual property rights and incur expenses associated with operating as a public company 
income taxes we operate through heeling sports limited  a texas limited partnership  and as such we are subject to texas franchise taxes on gross margin sourced to the state of texas 
in addition  the company is subject to income taxes in certain other states as a result of business activities being performed in those states 
in february  the company formed a subsidiary in belgium  with branch offices in germany and france  to function as the headquarters for sales operations for europe  the middle east and africa 
as a result  we are subject to tax in belgium  germany and france for and future periods so long as we have operations in these jurisdictions 
increased activities in foreign jurisdictions or the formation of additional foreign subsidiaries could cause us to be liable for income taxes in additional jurisdictions

seasonality similar to other vendors of footwear products  sales of our products are subject to seasonality 
there are three major buying seasons in footwear spring summer  back to school and holiday 
we offer two primary lines spring summer and a combined back to school holiday line 
a few new styles will typically be added for holiday 
shipments for spring summer take place during the first quarter and early weeks of the second quarter  shipments for back to school generally begin in may and finish in 
table of contents late august and shipments for the holiday season begin in october and finish in early december 
historically  we have experienced greater revenues in the second half of the year than those in the first half due to a concentration of shopping around the back to school and holiday seasons 
backlog historically  we received most of our orders three to four months prior to the date the products were shipped to customers 
at december   our backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  although generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment  cancellations have and may continue to occur 
in the current economic environment  our retail customers are being cautious when placing orders and have shifted towards shorter lead times and at once inventory purchases 
for a variety of reasons  including the timing of release dates for our product offerings  shipments  order deadlines and receipt of orders  backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales and may not be comparable from one period to another 
vulnerability due to customer concentration in  journeys accounted for of our net sales 
in  ag corporation and oxylane group accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
ag corporation is the company s independent distributor in japan  and oxylane group is a french sporting goods retail chain operating under the name decathlon 
we took over the distribution of our products in germany and austria german market effective april  and in france  monaco and andorra french market effective may  in  our german and french markets accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
no other retail customer or independent distributor accounted for or more of our net sales in either of these periods 
we anticipate that our net sales may remain concentrated for the foreseeable future 
if any of our significant retail customers or independent distributors decreases its purchases of our products or stops purchasing our products our net sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to net sales  collectability of accounts receivable  inventory reserve allowances  long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported consolidated financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the agreement with the customer 
revenues are stated net of discounts  marketing discretionary funds  estimated returns and other allowances  including permitted returns of damaged or defective merchandise 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various factors  including customer communications and analysis of relevant market information 
accounts receivable 
we continually make estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable  as well as estimates for customer returns  defective merchandise and allowances for co op advertising and marketing discretionary funds 
in determining these allowances  we consider our historical experience  level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
if we determine that smaller or larger allowances are appropriate  these changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded as cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is instead measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment might exist 
we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in impairment testing may be based upon a number of factors  including assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
estimates may also change in future periods as a result of  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  change to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any resulting impairment charge would be classified as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter 
income taxes 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  if we determine if it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established 
we follow guidance provided by financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  income taxes  asc 
asc prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain tax position that is 
table of contents more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority is recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain tax position is not recognized if the position has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
also  under asc  interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions 
we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
we recognize interest accrued related to recognized uncertain tax positions in interest expense and related penalties in general and administrative expenses 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet
