the company manages these risks through a program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily swaps and forwards 
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
these instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the extent to which the company uses such instruments is dependent upon its access to them in the financial markets and its use of other methods  such as netting exposures for foreign exchange risk and establishing sales arrangements that permit the pass through to customers of changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  to effectively achieve its goal of risk reduction 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow 
the company manages foreign currency exposures at the operating unit level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with derivative financial instruments where possible and cost effective in the company s judgment 
foreign exchange contracts which hedge defined exposures generally mature within twelve months 
the company  from time to time  enters into cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk for subsidiary debt which is denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
the table below provides information in us dollars as of december  about the company s forward currency exchange contracts

as discussed under 
note s to the consolidated financial statements  ceh has entered into a cross currency swap as a hedge against of that exposure 
the remaining exposure of is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts that are included in the table above 
crown holdings  inc the company  from time to time  may manage its interest rate risk  primarily from fluctuations in variable interest rates  through interest rate swaps in order to balance its exposure between fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs 
interest rate swaps and other methods of mitigating interest rate risk may increase overall interest expense 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations 
variable interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rates at december  year of maturity debt thereafter fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total future payments of  at december  include  of us dollar denominated debt  of euro denominated debt and of debt denominated in other currencies 
the company uses various raw materials  such as steel and aluminum in its manufacturing operations  which expose it to risk from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices 
in  consumption of steel and aluminum represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s consolidated cost of products sold  excluding depreciation and amortization 
the weighted average market price for steel used in packaging increased approximately and the average price of aluminum ingot on the london metal exchange decreased approximately during the company primarily manages its risk to adverse commodity price fluctuations and surcharges through contracts that pass through raw material costs to customers 
the company may  however  be unable to increase its prices to offset unexpected increases in raw material costs without suffering reductions in unit volume  revenue and operating income  and any price increases may take effect after related cost increases  reducing operating income in the near term 
in addition  the manufacturing facilities of the company are dependent  in varying degrees  upon the availability of water and processed energy  such as natural gas and electricity 
aluminum  a basic raw material of the company  is subject to significant price fluctuations the risk of which may be hedged by the company through forward commodity contracts 
current contracts involve aluminum forwards with a notional value of and a fair value gain of the maturities of the commodity contracts closely correlate to the anticipated purchases of those commodities 
these contracts are used in combination with commercial supply contracts with customers to manage exposure to price volatility

any possible loss or range of potential loss that may be incurred in excess of the recorded reserves cannot be estimated

at the end of each quarter  the company considers whether there have been any material developments that would cause it to update its asbestos liability accrual calculations 
absent any significant developments in the asbestos litigation environment in general or with respect to the company specifically  the company updates its accrual calculations in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s asbestos liability accrual is calculated in the fourth quarter of each year as the sum of its outstanding and expected future claims  multiplied by the expected average settlement cost of those claims  plus estimated legal fees 
claims in those states where the company s liability is limited by statute are included in the number of outstanding claims but are assumed to have no value 
the expected number of claims and the expected average settlement cost per claim are calculated using projections based on the actual data for the most recent five years 
because claims are not submitted or settled evenly throughout the year  it is difficult to predict at any time during the year whether the number of claims or average settlement cost over the five year period ending december of such year will increase compared to the prior five year period 
at the end of  the five year average settlement cost per claim was higher than at the end of the preceding two years 
the effect of these increases in the expected average settlement cost per claim was partially mitigated by a decrease in each year in the expected number of future claims 
the combination of the projected increase in cost per claim  the projected decrease in the number of future claims  and including an additional year in the ten year projection each year  resulted in a charge of in compared to in and in the charge of in was higher than the charges in and because the increase in the projected average cost per claim in was higher than in and a change in either the number of projected claims or the average cost per claim would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by a increase or decrease in these two factors at the same time would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by and  respectively 
goodwill impairment the company performs a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments  including the calculation of fair value for the company s identified reporting units 
the company determines the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on the average of the estimated fair values calculated using market values for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow projections 
the company uses an average of the two methods in estimating fair value because it believes they provide an equal probability of yielding an appropriate fair value for the reporting unit 
the company s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions  and technological changes and may differ from actual future cash flows 
under the first method of calculating estimated fair value  the company obtains publicly available trading multiples based on the enterprise value of companies in the packaging industry whose shares are publicly traded 
the company also reviews available information regarding the multiples used in recent transactions  if any  involving transfers of controlling interests in the packaging industry 
the appropriate multiple is applied to the forecasted ebitda a non gaap item defined by the company as net customer sales  less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization  less selling and administrative expenses of the reporting unit to obtain an estimated fair value 
under the second method  fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and the terminal value at the end of those five years 
the projected cash flows generally include no growth assumption unless there has recently been a material change in the business or a material change is forecasted 
the discount rate used is based on the average weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry  which information is available through various sources 
the terminal value at the end of the five years is the product of the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period and the trading multiple 
the company used an ebitda multiple of times and a discount rate of in its review 
the assumed ebitda multiple was increased from the times used in due to an increase in trading multiples of companies in the packaging industry 
the discount rate in was decreased from the used in due to a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry 
the company did not have any reporting unit at the end of whose fair value did not materially exceed its carrying value 
the discussion below provides information on the company s assumptions and conclusions regarding its review of the european closures reporting unit in this reporting unit manufactures and sells metal vacuum food closures and is part of the european food segment 
additional discussion of this reporting unit is provided because the company recorded an impairment charge of in the european closures reporting unit in crown holdings  inc during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of in its european closures reporting unit due to a decrease in projected operating results 
the segment income of the business was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and as of the end of  the company was projecting segment income of the decrease in segment income  compared to results and the company s projections  was primarily due to lower sales unit volumes and an inability to recover cost increases through increased selling prices 
in its projections for the european metal vacuum food closures business for  the company expected to see some pressure on selling prices based on preliminary discussions with its customers  but believed it could compensate for these losses through increased sales unit volumes that could be obtained from existing or new customers throughout the year 
however  due to aggressive pricing by certain of the company s competitors an effort to maintain or increase their sales unit volumes  the company was unable to increase volumes for as allocations were finalized during the first two quarters 
in addition to its effect on the company s sales unit volumes  the competitive situation also depressed selling prices throughout the year beyond the company s expectations 
the aggressive pricing policies evident in were unexpected in a business that previously had consistent segment income and relatively stable selling prices 
as of october   it was management s judgment that the adverse competitive situation was temporary based on its understanding of the competitive market at that time 
however  at the conclusion of the budget process  which occurred at the end of only after initial discussions with existing and potential cust omers related to pricing and volumes  management concluded that the depressed selling prices and competition for sales volume would likely continue  and that segment income was unlikely to improve 
due to this second consecutive year of reduced segment income  and absent any evidence to the contrary  the company determined that it was appropriate to assume similar results for its projections used to calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit at the end of long lived assets impairment the company performs an impairment review of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets 
these estimates may differ from actual cash flows or useful lives 
tax valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the tax assets will not be realized 
the estimate of the amount that will not be realized requires the use of assumptions concerning the company s future taxable income 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the company considers all sources of taxable income in estimating its valuation allowances  including taxable income in any available carry back period  the reversal of taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and taxable income expected to be generated in the future other than reversing temporary differences 
should the company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the period such a change in estimate was made 
crown holdings  inc the company s valuation allowances of at december  include in the us  in france  in canada  in belgium  in the netherlands  in asia and in poland 
during the fourth quarter of  the company released of its us deferred tax valuation allowances based on management s judgment that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax benefits will be realized 
the valuation allowance release included for foreign tax credits that expire in through and for research credits that expire in prior to the fourth quarter of  the company was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that these tax credits  which can only be used after all of the company s tax losses are used  would be realized before their expiration 
contributing to uncertainty regarding the company s us taxable income in and beyond were a significant increase in in the cost of steel used in the production of certain cans and closures and the company s ability to recover those costs from customers  the effect of the credit crisis on demand for the company s products  and the possibility that the company s pension plan assets would suffer additional market losses and require the company to contribute additional funds to the plan beyond those already considered in its projections 
the company s determination in the fourth quarter of that it was more likely than not that it would have sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets was not as a result of any single event or development in the fourth quarter  but rather a review in the fourth quarter of the company s results for the year  its pension plan assets and liabilities at the end of the year  and its budget for based on the results and sales unit volumes  an increase in pension plan assets due to market returns  and a budget that projects the results can be maintained  the company concluded there was sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowance related to these tax credits 
as of december   the company had of remaining valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets including for state tax loss carryforwards  for capital loss carryforwards  and for research credits 
the state tax loss carryforwards expire as follows in through  in through  and thereafter 
the capital loss carryforwards expire in and and the research credits expire in future realization of the company s of net us deferred tax assets will require approximately billion of aggregated us taxable income 
the table in note w to the consolidated financial statements reports us book income loss of  and for  and  respectively 
in  the company had approximately of us taxable income compared to the book loss of due to differences arising from of foreign source income that is not included in the book loss  of us gaap pension expense in excess of pension plan contributions  and of other permanent and temporary differences 
it is possible that the company may be required to increase its us valuation allowance at some future time if its projections of book and taxable income are incorrect in the aggregate or in the timing of certain deductions  such as pension plan contributions 
as of december   the company was in a three year cumulative loss position in france and had a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
due primarily to reduced floating interest rates and a resulting significant reduction in interest expense  the french operations were profitable in during the third quarter of  the company released of its french deferred tax valuation allowances based on management s judgment that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized in through in the fourth quarter of  the company released an additional of valuation allowance based on a refined estimate including a review of its budget 
prior to the third quarter of  the company was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that it would realize any future benefit from its deferred tax assets 
contributing to uncertainty regarding taxable income in and beyond were a significant increase in in the cost of steel and the effect of the credit crisis on demand for the company s products 
the company has a large food can business in france and the third quarter is a critical period as cans are purchased by its customers to pack the harvest 
after reviewing the third quarter operating results in france  the company was able to conclude that it was more likely than not that the improvements in interest expense would not be offset by reductions in operating results  and that it would realize some portion of its deferred tax assets 
the company is unable to conclude at this time that it is more likely than not that it will realize any additional deferred tax benefits in france beyond  primarily due to uncertainty concerning the amount of future interest expense in its french operations 
the company s european revolving credit facility expires in may and its european term loan expires in november both of these facilities are in france and the company s french operations are currently benefitting from low base interest rates and floating interest rates on this debt 
for purposes of reviewing its valuation allowance the company has assumed  based on current market conditions  that its revolving credit facility will be refinanced at higher base rates at the end of  and  because a similar term loan facility may not be available  that its term loan will be replaced by a fixed rate note 
the company has also assumed that the operating profit in its french operations will remain consistent 
the company s net deferred tax assets in france before valuation allowances consist of of deferred tax assets  including of tax loss carryforwards that do not expire  and of deferred tax liabilities 
it is possible that the company may be required to increase this valuation allowance at some future time if its income projections for to are later revised downwards 
it is also possible that the company will release additional portions of its french valuation allowance in future periods if its income projections are revised upwards due to improved operating profits  or if it refinances its debt at interest rates lower than those assumed in its projections 
in addition  future changes in tax laws or tax planning could cause the company to restructure the amount of debt in its french operations as part of its tax planning strategies  which could impact the amount of interest expense and profits in these operations 
crown holdings  inc as of december   the company has a full valuation allowance of against its net deferred tax assets in canada 
the net deferred tax assets of include of tax loss carryforwards that expire in to the canadian operations remain in a three year cumulative loss position and had a significant loss in due to low operating margins and plant closing costs 
the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowance in canada  but it is possible that some or all of its canadian valuation allowance will be reversed in the future if the results of operations improve 
as of december   the company has a valuation allowance of for tax loss carryforwards in belgium that do not expire  including in a dormant entity that the company does not believe at this time it will be able to utilize 
the remaining of valuation allowance is in an operating entity that was slightly profitable in  but remains in a three year cumulative loss position at the end of the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowance for the operating entity  but it is possible some or all of the valuation allowance will be released in the future if the entity s results of operations improve 
as of december   the company has a valuation allowance of against its deferred tax assets in a dutch subsidiary  including for tax loss carryforwards that do not expire 
the entity has a profit of in  but remains in a three year cumulative loss position at the end of and is projected to be break even in the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowance for this entity  but it is possible some or all of the valuation allowance will be released in the future if the entity s results of operations improve 
the remaining valuation allowances of in asia and in poland are also in entities where the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowances  but it is possible some or all of the valuation allowances will be released in the future 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets of in a spanish entity 
the entity had a profit of in and is projecting a similar profit in  but it is possible that the company will need to provide a valuation allowance in the future if the profits are not maintained 
unrecognized tax positions the company recognizes the impact of a tax position if  in the company s opinion  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of that position 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the determination of whether the impact should be recognized  and the measurement of the impact  can require significant judgment and the company s estimate may differ from actual settlement amounts

crown holdings  inc pension and postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the rate of return assumptions are reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies  current asset allocations and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets 
the us plan s assumed asset rate of return of was based on a calculation using underlying assumed rates of return of for equity securities and alternative investments  and for debt securities and real estate 
an assumed rate of was used for equity securities and alternative investments based on the total return of the s p for the year period ended december  the company believes that the equity securities included in the s p are representative of the equity securities and alternative investments held by its us plan  and that years provides a sufficient time horizon as a basis for estimating future returns 
the company used a assumed return for debt securities  consistent with the us plan discount rate and the return on aa corporate bonds with duration equal to the plan s liabilities 
the underlying debt securities in the plan are primarily invested in various corporate and government agency securities and are benchmarked against returns on aa corporate bonds 
the uk plan s assumed asset rate of return of was based on a calculation using underlying assumed rates of return of for equity securities and alternative investments  and for debt securities and real estate 
equity securities in the uk plan as of december  were allocated approximately to us securities  to uk securities  to securities in european countries other than the uk  and to securities in other countries 
the assumed rate of for equity securities and alternative investments represents the weighted average year return of equity securities in these markets 
the company believes that the equity securities included in the related market indexes are representative of the equity securities and alternative investments held by its uk plan  and that years provides a sufficient time horizon as a basis for estimating future returns 
a change in the expected rates of return would change pension expense by approximately discount rates were selected using a method that matches projected payouts from the plans with zero coupon aa bond yield curves in the respective currencies 
the yield curves were constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plans measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized  individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years 
each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the aa bond universe  apportioned into distinct maturity groups 
these individual discount rates were then converted into a single equivalent discount rate 
to assure that the resulting rates can be achieved by the plan  only bonds with sufficient capacity that satisfy certain criteria and are expected to remain available through the period of maturity of the plan benefits were used to develop the discount rate 
a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement expense by approximately see 
note v to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions 
crown holdings  inc as of december   the company had pre tax unrecognized net losses in other comprehensive income of  related to its pension plans and related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
unrecognized gains and losses arise each year primarily due to changes in discount rates  differences in actual plan asset returns compared to expected returns  and changes in actuarial assumptions such as mortality 
for example  as disclosed in note v to the consolidated financial statements  the unrecognized net loss in the company s pension plans included a current year loss of consisting of a gain of due to actual asset returns of compared to expected returns of  offset by losses of primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of compared to unrecognized gains and losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income and the portion in each plan that exceeds of the greater of that plan s assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income over future periods 
the company s pension expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in unrecognized net losses of  in the pension plans as of december  include in the uk defined benefit plan  in the u 
s defined benefit plan  in the canadian defined benefit plans  and in other plans 
amortizable losses in the uk plan are being recognized over years  representing the average expected life of inactive employees as over of the plan participants are inactive and the fund is closed to new participants 
amortizable losses in the us plan are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
amortizable losses in the canadian plans are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
an increase of in the number of years used to amortize unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease estimated charges for by or a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by or unrecognized net losses of in the company s other postretirement benefit plans as of december   primarily included in the us plans  with the amortizable portion being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
the company s other postretirement benefits expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in an increase of in the number of years used to amortize the unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease the estimated charge for by or a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by or stock based compensation calculation of the estimated fair value of stock option awards requires the use of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including the expected term of the options  the annual risk free interest rate over the options expected term  the expected annual dividend yield on the underlying stock over the options expected term  and the expected stock price volatility over the options expected term 
the company generally bases its assumptions of option term and expected price volatility on historical data  but also considers other factors  such as vesting or expiration provisions in new awards that are inconsistent with past awards  that would make the historical data unreliable as a basis for future assumptions 
estimates of the fair value of stock options are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock option awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the company

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance that eliminates the qualified special purpose entities qspes concept  established to facilitate off balance sheet treatment of certain securitizations 
more stringent criteria must be met to qualify for sale accounting when only a portion of a financial asset is transferred 
the guidance impacts new transfers of many types of financial assets for example  receivables securitization and factoring arrangements occurring after the effective date 
the guidance is effective for the company on january  the company is currently evaluating the requirements of this guidance  but believes it will require the company to report its receivables securitization facilities as securitized borrowings instead of as sales of receivables  thus increasing the company s reported debt 
the amount of securitized receivables was as of december  and at its highest level during if the amounts are reported as borrowings  the company s reported cash flow from operations in will be negatively impacted by this change 
for example  if the new guidance had been effective as of january  instead of  the company s cash flow from operations would have been less than the amount reported and its cash flow from financing activities would have been higher 
this anticipated negative impact on cash flow from operations is limited to and will not recur in future periods
