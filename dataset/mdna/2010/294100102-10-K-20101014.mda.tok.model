effect of new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force relating to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this standard provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company will adopt this guidance effective august  the company has assessed the impact of adoption and it is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in august  the company adopted the provisions of the accounting standard on fair value measurements that apply to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to establish the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
this guidance only impacted references for accounting guidance 
on august   the company adopted the revised authoritative guidance on business combinations which changed existing practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements are now fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs are now expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  reversal of valuation allowances created in purchase accounting are now recorded through the income tax provision  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  all authoritative guidance would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements  it could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated in the future and for tax matters relating to prior acquisitions settled subsequent to july  contractual obligations the company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases and has employment agreements with certain executive officers 
the real estate lease for the company s farmingdale clinical lab and research facility is with a related party 
see item  properties  and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the following is a summary of future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period in s total less than year years years over years real estate and equipment leases employment agreements total contractual cash obligations management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual expense  allowance for uncollectible accounts  inventory  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title transfers  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties royalty revenues are recorded in the period earned 
royalties received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues 
license fees and multiple element arrangements when evaluating multiple element arrangements  the company considers whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
the evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
license fees received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues 
revenues clinical laboratory services revenues from the clinical labs segment are recognized upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician 
these revenues and the associated accounts receivable are based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of a contractual adjustment  which is the difference between amounts billed to payers and the expected approved reimbursable settlements from such payers 
the following table represents the clinical laboratory segment s net revenues and percentages by revenue category year ended july year ended july year ended july revenue category in s in in s in in s in medicare third party payers patient self pay hmo s total the company provides services to certain patients covered by various third party payers  including the federal medicare program 
laws and regulations governing medicare are complex and subject to interpretation for which action for noncompliance includes fines  penalties and exclusion from the medicare programs 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
other than the medicare program  one provider whose programs are included in the third party payer and health maintenance organizations hmo s categories represented   and of the clinical labs segment s services net revenues for the fiscal years ended july   and respectively 
contractual adjustment the company s estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments  such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies  and bears the risk of change 
the estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers  versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers 
the contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue  based on gross billing rates  to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed 
gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations hmo s and managed care 
the company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly  based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers  industry reimbursement trends  and other relevant factors 
the other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer  current changes in third party arrangements 
the growth of in network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our company 
our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third party payers  such as medicare which principally serves patients and older and insurers 
we are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third party payers  as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates 
changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues 
the number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future 
in addition  medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care 
these trends will continue to reduce our revenues 
during the years ended july   and  the contractual adjustment percentages  determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics  were  and  respectively  of gross billings 
the company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care  or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform 
however  there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform  that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed  or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue 
the company estimates by using a sensitivity analysis that each point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended july  and  respectively  and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately  and  as of july  and  respectively 
our clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing 
therefore  we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period 
however  we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process  which includes an analysis of industry reimbursement trends  an evaluation of third party reimbursement rates changes and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third party payers  a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers  an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue 
the following is a table of the company s net accounts receivable by segment 
the clinical labs segment s net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables 
as of july  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s net accounts receivable relates to its clinical labs business  which operates in the new york  new jersey and eastern pennsylvania medical communities 
the life sciences segment s accounts receivable  of which million or and million or represents foreign receivables as of july  and respectively  includes royalty receivables of million  as of july  and  of which approximately million and million  respectively is from qiagen corporation 
net accounts receivable as of july  as of july  billing category in s in in s in clinical labs medicare third party payers patient self pay hmo s total clinical labs total life sciences total accounts receivable changes in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows in s july  july  beginning balance provision for doubtful accounts write offs  net ending balance for the clinical labs segment  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that the company does not expect to collect after the company has exhausted its collection procedures 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts in the period the related services are billed and adjusts the estimate in future accounting periods as necessary 
it bases the estimate for the allowance on the evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of accounts receivable  the historical doubtful account write off percentages  payer mix  and other relevant factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes the balances  after receipt of the approved settlements from third party payers for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the ordering physician  which result in denials of payment and the uncollectible portion of receivables from self payers  including deductibles and copayments  which are subject to credit risk and patients ability to pay 
during the years ended july  and  the company determined an allowance for doubtful accounts less than days and wrote off of accounts receivable over days  as it assumed those accounts are uncollectible  except for certain fully reserved balances  principally related to medicare 
these accounts have not been written off because the payer s filing date deadline has not occurred or the collection process has not been exhausted 
the company s collection experience on medicare receivables beyond days has been insignificant 
the company adjusts the historical collection analysis for recoveries  if any  on an ongoing basis 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the allowance estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the accurate information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
should circumstances change eg shift in payer mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables  our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
billing for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors  especially the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with  disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers  and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement 
the following table indicates the clinical labs aged gross receivables by payer group in thousands  which is prior to adjustment to gross receivables for contractual adjustment  fully reserved balances not yet written off  and other revenue adjustments 
as of july  total amount medicare amount third party payers amount self pay amount hmo s amount days days days days days greater than days totals as of july  total amount medicare amount third party payers amount self pay amount hmo s amount days days days days days greater than days totals total includes fully reserved over days as of july  total includes fully reserved over days as of july  at july  the company fully reserved and excluded from the above table all receivables on its legacy billing system which was replaced in august during fiscal all such reserved balances were written off 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company adopted the accounting standard related to unrecognized tax benefits on august  the cumulative effect of adopting the standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
work in process and finished goods inventories consist of material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimate of sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimate of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
at july  and  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was  and  respectively 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill  representing the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized  but are evaluated annually for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit  which is based on geographic region  is estimated using both a discounted cash flow model and weighted average multiple of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in determining fair value  the company makes certain judgments  including the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies 
trademarks are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds their estimated fair value 
the fair value of the trademarks is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
to date  there has been no impairment charges recorded 
intangible assets intangible assets exclusive of patents  arose primarily from acquisitions and primarily consist of customer relationships  trademarks  licenses  employment and non compete agreements  and website and database content 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized according to their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
the company has capitalized certain legal costs directly incurred in pursuing patent applications as patent costs 
when such applications result in an issued patent  the related costs are amortized over a ten year period or the life of the patent  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
the company reviews its issued patents and pending patent applications  and if it determines to abandon a patent application or that an issued patent no longer has economic value  the unamortized balance in deferred patent costs relating to that patent is immediately expensed 
accrual for self funded medical accruals for self funded medical insurance are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical payment trends  claims history and current estimates 
these estimated liabilities are not discounted 
if actual trends differ from these estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
as of july   the company has established a reserve of million  which is included in accrued liabilities  for claims that have been reported but not paid and incurred but not reported 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from acquisitions with foreign locations see item a 
risk factors and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and  to a much lesser extent  interest rates on investments in short term instruments  that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or market risk management tools 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the financial reporting of our non us subsidiaries is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
since the functional currency of our non us subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
assuming a hypothetical aggregate change of in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar at july   our assets and liabilities would increase or decrease by million and million  respectively  and our net sales and net earnings loss would increase or decrease by million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
we also maintain intercompany balances and loans receivable with subsidiaries with different local currencies 
these amounts are at risk of foreign exchange losses if exchange rates fluctuate 
assuming a hypothetical aggregate change of in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar at july   our pre tax earnings loss would be favorably or unfavorably impacted by approximately million on an annual basis 
interest rate risk our excess cash is invested in highly liquid short term us treasury bills and money market funds with high credit ratings 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash and cash equivalents and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
as of july   we were exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to our short term investments in us government instruments of million 
the short term investments bear interest rates ranging from to 
each basis point or fluctuation in interest rates will increase or decrease interest income on the short term investments by approximately million on an annual basis 
as of july   we did not maintain any fixed or variable interest rate financing
