item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies to all manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and commercialization of products for the medical device market 
net sales from the inspectra sto system during  our third full year in the market  were  over the course of  we added new customers and grew the installed base of inspectra sto systems to across customers  up from across customers at the end of while the pace of customer acceptance and adoption was slower than we had hoped in  we were able to broaden the installed base in the face of hospital spending constraints 
the division s net sales in are currently expected to range from  to  these expectations for net sales are contingent upon growing market acceptance of our existing and new products and upon hospital spending levels  which have been constrained by industry economic conditions 
in  due to the weak economy  consumer spending declined and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics decreased  as well as business demand for computer systems  and demand for suspension assemblies therefore was adversely impacted 
in response to weakened demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  in we took actions to reduce our cost structure and improve our cash flow to help us to meet the current portion of our debt obligations and make strategic investments as needed 
to achieve improvements in efficiency and facility utilization and to reduce operating costs  we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
we also consolidated photoetching operations into our hutchinson  minnesota site and trace operations into our eau claire  wisconsin site 
in addition to the weakened demand  during the third quarter of  we were notified by one of our customers  seagate  that it intended to significantly reduce its procurement of our suspension assemblies 
while the overall market for suspension assemblies grew in  our shipments of suspension assemblies declined from due to further market share losses 
in addition  a defect on some of our tsa product resulted in lost volume in the third and fourth quarters of in our biomeasurement division  slower than expected sales growth based on the current pace of adoption of the inspectra sto system and spending constraints in health care markets world wide led us to initiate operating changes within the biomeasurement division to reduce our operating loss 
for  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets related to the manufacturing and selling of inspectra sto systems 
as we evaluated the impact of our operating changes on our forecast of future operating results in our biomeasurement division  we determined that the recorded values of many of the division assets were no longer deemed recoverable 
since these assets are no longer expected to generate future positive cash flows in excess of the recorded values  the assets were impaired but will continue to be used on an ongoing basis 
during the fourth quarter  we completed the construction of our thailand facility on time 
we are now shipping product from the thailand assembly operation for customer qualification  as planned 
the thailand operation will be instrumental to attaining our goal of being the lowest cost producer of suspension assemblies 
we anticipate that the thailand assembly operation will improve our ability to serve our customers operations in asia and enable us to reduce our labor costs  freight costs and future income taxes 
we spent approximately  in capital expenditures in related to our thailand assembly operation 
we also spent approximately  on facility startup expenses in and expect to spend approximately  more for startup expenses in the first quarter of we expect our cost position to steadily improve as we shift more assembly volume to the thailand site 
during the fourth quarter  we took actions to further reduce costs and preserve cash 
we targeted annualized cost reductions of approximately  company wide 
in our biomeasurement division  we expect to reduce annualized costs by approximately  in light of slower than expected revenue growth and we will focus our sales and marketing activities primarily on the customers  applications and geographic markets where we have momentum 
these planned cost reductions in our biomeasurement division were more than complete at the end and will substantially reduce the division s operation loss in in our disk drive components division  we reduced costs by approximately  while keeping intact capabilities that are core to our competitive position  including product design  rapid prototype development  speed to volume and very low part to part variation in our finished product 
we also reduced our corporate expenses by approximately  the disk drive components division reductions and corporate expense reductions were nearly complete at the end of our cash and investments balance totaled  at the end of  compared with  at the end of the preceding year 
with the repayment of our convertible subordinated notes due notes and the loan balance obtained against our portfolio of auction rate securities  we reduced the principal amount of our debt balance from  at the end of to  at the end of  with all but  subject to holders right to require us to repurchase the notes for cash on or after january of in the long term  we believe that end user demand for storage capacity will continue to increase as evolving consumer electronics and computing applications continue to require storage devices with increased capacity and functionality  which will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand 
as we enter calendar year  we believe that customer inventory reductions will be largely complete 
as a result and due to growing confidence in the reliability of supply from our tsa process  we expect our shipments in each of the last three quarters of will exceed the quarterly volume of our shipments in our first quarter 
to return to positive cash generation and profitability  we must increase revenues through volume growth in our disk drive components division 
the growth will come through capturing overall market growth and through regaining market share 
we believe improvements in our tsa efficiency and output  coupled with cost reductions that will result from ramping up assembly operations at our plant in thailand  will help us resume volume growth 
in our biomeasurement division  we have substantially reduced costs to narrow the division s operating losses 
with the expected introduction of our spot check product in  we are offering an easy and inexpensive means for clinicians to identify patients at risk  which we believe will increase the use of st 
monitoring 
the following table sets forth our quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities for our disk drive components division in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities our second quarter shipments decreased primarily due to lower demand for disk drives  lower disk drive production as the drive makers reduced inventory levels and a modest loss of overall market share 
the share loss was primarily in the inch ata segment that was partially offset by share gains in the inch ata segment 
our third quarter shipments increased percent compared with the preceding quarter as a result of stronger demand in every segment 
our first quarter shipments increased from the fourth quarter of primarily due to normal seasonal increases 
in our second quarter  our percent sequential quarter decline in shipments was more than the estimated decline in world wide suspension assembly shipments 
this market share loss resulted primarily from our broad implementation of a tsa process improvement in that quarter that prevented us from meeting demand and from share shifts among disk drive manufacturers 
our third quarter shipments declined percent sequentially primarily due to reductions in disk drive makers production plans 
in addition  we lost volume late in the quarter due to a defect on some of our tsa product which prevented us from realizing expected share growth opportunities on certain customer programs 
our fourth quarter shipments declined about five percent due to inventory reductions at a certain customer that reduced our shipments  and shipments were also negatively impacted by the tsa product defect we encountered late in the third quarter of our average selling price decreased from in our fourth quarter to in our fourth quarter due to shifts in product mix and competitive pressures 
we expect continued downward pressure on our average selling price in our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  key among them being changes in demand for our suspension assemblies 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vmi facilities 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
from the end of to the first quarter of  we substantially improved our gross margin despite a decline in net sales 
the improvement was the result of the actions we took in to restructure our business and reduce our costs  as well as a turnaround in demand that began in the latter half of gross profit in the first quarter of was percent  up from percent in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to an increase in net sales 
gross profit decreased in the second quarter of  however  to  or percent  primarily due to a percent sequential quarter decline in suspension assembly shipments 
gross profit in the third quarter of decreased to  or percent of net sales  primarily due to a further decline in suspension assembly shipments  an estimated  of costs related to a tsa product defect and  of asset impairments in our biomeasurement division  but also benefited from a build in suspension assembly inventory 
in the fourth quarter of  our gross profit was zero primarily due to a percent reduction in our finished goods inventory  which brought our finished goods inventory levels down from weeks to weeks 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvement in our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of we shipped million tsa suspension assemblies during  up from million in and six million in for  we expect tsa suspension assemblies to account for a steadily increasing proportion of our shipments  growing from approximately a third of our shipments in the fourth quarter of to half of our shipments by mid and two thirds of our shipments by the end of we believe the industry will fully transition to additive suspensions over the next two to four years 
we are also purchasing additive flexures to fill other customer requirements 
in the third and fourth quarters of  a defect on some of our tsa product resulted in lost shipments 
the measures we took to isolate and contain the product defect also reduced our yield and limited our output for those quarters  which prevented us from realizing some expected opportunities to gain share 
due to the yield reduction and additional costs associated with the tsa product defect  the tsa flexure cost burden declined less than we expected in and we are now targeting elimination of the cost burden in the first half of we may in the future experience additional process issues that could impact our ability to meet customer demand and cause us to incur higher costs 
we are actively involved with several of our customers on dsa designs and prototypes 
we are shipping prototypes of dsa suspensions to four of the five hard disk drive oems  and we have received very positive feedback regarding the performance of our dsa suspensions in their tests 
the timing and volume of our customers dsa programs are subject to  among other things  the economics of existing and future technical alternatives that may also meet their disk drive requirements 
for  our capital expenditures were  primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling and deployment of new process technology and capability improvements 
capital spending for was  primarily for additional tsa suspension production capacity  construction of our thailand assembly operation and new program tooling 
we currently expect our capital expenditures to be approximately  to  in  primarily for additional tsa flexure production capacity and tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies 
we continue to gain customer acceptance on new programs with our tsa products and expect tsa suspensions to grow significantly as a percentage of our product mix  as they continue to replace tsa suspensions 
market trends our suspension assemblies are components in hard disk drives used in computers and a variety of consumer electronics products 
we believe that the continued growth of digital content world wide requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage and backup content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drives 
non compute applications  such as digital video recorders dvrs  gaming devices  digital cameras and internet based storage of consumer data are driving the broad  global growth of digital content through creation and sharing of all types of digital content  such as high resolution photos  high definition video and movies  and music by consumers and data by enterprises  collection and distribution of digital content through services and other company offerings such as youtube by google  inc  network infrastructure  including broadband  cable and satellite  which is enabling the access  hosting and distribution of digital content  consumption of digital content through dvrs  handheld devices and gaming consoles  and protection of content through storage backup devices and services 
however  the demand for disk drives and  therefore suspension assemblies can be volatile as experienced in calendar and due to market and world economic conditions 
in a weak economy  consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics tends to decrease  as does business demand for computer systems 
demand for suspension assemblies  therefore  may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the growth in digital content and the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software as well as the data intensive non compute market will increase demand for disk drives and therefore  suspension assemblies 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices in which disk drives are used 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per unit of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with flexures that have finer electrical conductors  greater lead counts and increased complexity such as interleaved or stacked traces  and to the adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as formed and polished headlifts  larger dampers with through hole features  and a variety of limiter configurations 
we are also actively involved with several of our customers on dsa designs and prototypes 
the development of next generation read write technology and the introduction of new types or configurations of read write heads configurations and sizes  and the continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we are investing in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the advent of new disk drive technologies may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for suspension assemblies when they are introduced  our selling prices decrease as our products mature

during  we recorded a litigation charge of  related to the tentative settlement of a class action lawsuit 
the lawsuit challenged our pay practices pertaining to the time certain production employees spend gowning and ungowning at the beginning and end of their shifts and meal breaks 
the charge was comprised of settlement payments to these employees and payment of their attorney s fees and expenses 
loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the increased loss from biomeasurement operations was due to higher allocated expenses from corporate departments as the business has grown and to severance expenses 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of an overall lower interest rate environment 
interest expense for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest expense for was primarily due to lower capitalized interest expense resulting from reduced capital investments and reduced interest expense due to our debt repurchases during the fiscal year 
during  we recorded a gain of  related to the rights offering and increased value of our ars due to changes in the interest rate spread used in our discounted cash flow model  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to an other than temporary impairment of our long term investments to reflect the reduction in carrying value of our ars from a par value of  to an estimated fair value of  in light of then current uncertain market and economic conditions  we concluded we may not hold our ars until final maturity up to years if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
during the first  third and fourth quarters of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at varying discount to face value 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
at the time of repurchase the notes had a book value of  which includes the par value of the notes  offset by the remaining debt discount of  we have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  was included in our consolidated financial statements 
the income tax benefit for was  the income tax benefit for is due primarily to certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of that permit certain tax credits to be converted into cash refunds in lieu of claiming bonus depreciation  which was partially reduced by foreign income tax expense 
the income tax provision for was  the pretax loss for resulted in a statutory tax benefit of  the negative annual effective tax rate was caused by the full valuation allowance charge of  against our deferred tax assets 
fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at september   to  at september  our short and long term investments decreased from  to  during the same period 
in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments decreased by  this decrease was primarily due to  used for repurchases of long term debt and  for capital expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by  of cash generated from operations 
in light of the significant decreases in our net sales over the past two completed fiscal years and current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are aggressively managing our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve long term profitable growth 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and additional financing  if needed and as available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  other debt service requirements  debt and equity repurchases and capital expenditures through holders of our  par value outstanding notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  we anticipate that we would need to obtain additional financing if the holders of our notes require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on that date 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional financing on terms acceptable to us  including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short term  or at all  if needed 
if we are unable to obtain new financing  if and when necessary  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
effective december   we entered into a settlement the ubs settlement with ubs ag  ubs financial services inc and ubs securities llc collectively  ubs that provided liquidity for our ars portfolio held with ubs and to resolve pending litigation between the parties 
the ubs settlement provided for certain arrangements  one of which was our acceptance of an offer by ubs to issue to us ars rights the rights offering  which allowed us to require ubs to repurchase at par value all of the ars held by us in accounts with ubs at any time during the period from june   through july  if our ars had not previously been sold by us or by ubs on our behalf or redeemed by the respective issuers of those securities 
during the fourth quarter of  we exercised the rights issued to us in the rights offering for the remaining ars held by us and subject to the rights offering 
as part of the ubs settlement  we also entered into a loan agreement with ubs credit corp 
ubs credit  which provided us with a line of credit the ubs credit line secured only by the ars we held in accounts with ubs 
the proceeds derived from any sales of the ars we held in accounts with ubs were to be applied to repayment of the ubs credit line 
following our exercise of the rights issued to us in the rights offering  the proceeds of the repurchase of ars were applied to repay the ubs credit line 
as of september   we had repaid all of the ubs credit line available to us 
on march   we entered into a settlement agreement with citigroup global markets inc cgmi providing for the sale of a portion of our ars 
we received approximately  in cash plus accrued interest in exchange for  in principal amount of our ars 
as a result  we recorded an additional realized loss on the sale of these ars of  during the quarter ended march  as of december   we had recorded an other than temporary realized loss of  on these ars 
for a three year period  the settlement agreement with cgmi provides us with the option to repurchase some or all of these ars at the price for which we sold them  and the potential for additional recoveries in the event of issuer redemptions 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to dismiss with prejudice an arbitration proceeding between us and cgmi and an affiliate of cgmi relating to these ars 
in january  we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of january  the indenture 
interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july  we have the right to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes on or after january  at specified redemption prices  as provided in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the applicable redemption date 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on january   january   and january   or in the event of a fundamental change  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the purchase date 
we may from time to time seek to retire portions of the outstanding notes through cash repurchases or exchanges for the securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
under certain circumstances  holders of the notes may convert their notes based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  in lieu of shares of our common stock  for each  principal amount of notes a holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i  or ii the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture  of the number of shares of our common stock equal to the conversion rate 
if the conversion value exceeds  we also will deliver  at our election  cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion 
if a holder elects to convert such holder s notes in connection with a fundamental change that occurs prior to january   we will pay  to the extent described in the indenture  a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate applicable to such notes 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance for accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this guidance specifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion shall be separately accounted for by allocating a portion of the fair value of the instrument as a liability and the remainder as equity 
the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount shall be amortized to interest cost over the effective term 
the provisions of this guidance apply to our notes 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning in our first quarter of  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of the notes that matured and were retired on march  during  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at varying discounts to face value 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
at the time of the repurchase the notes had a book value of  which includes the par value of the notes  offset by the remaining debt discount of  we currently have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the first and second quarters of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
on the maturity date of the notes  march   we used our available cash and cash equivalents to pay par value of  to retire all of the outstanding notes 
none of the notes remain outstanding 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for   for and  for the decrease from to was primarily due to the weakened demand for our suspension assemblies in and our actions to reduce our overall cost structure and increase our cash position 
capital spending for was primarily for additional tsa flexure production capacity  establishing our thailand assembly operation and new tooling program 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  to  in  primarily for additional tsa flexure production capacity and tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies 
as the full transition to tsa suspensions takes place over the next two to four years  our capital expenditures could increase as we add capacity as needed 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  our credit facility or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions or dsa suspensions 
capital spending is also based on our ability to fund capital expenditures  as needed  with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  the credit facility or additional financing  if available given current capital market conditions 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
as we develop the market for our inspectra sto system  we will continue to spend money on medical device sales in our biomeasurement division 
for  our biomeasurement division incurred an operating loss of  and we expect the division to continue to incur losses in we are taking actions expected to reduce annualized costs by approximately  in this division  which will reduce future operating losses 
our future losses  however  along with growing working capital needs as the business grows  will negatively affect our ability to generate cash 
on may   we entered into an agreement to sell our real property in sioux falls  south dakota and certain related personal property for cash consideration of  the sale closed on july  the sale resulted in a gain of  which was recorded in our fourth quarter of we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase program is  we have not repurchased any shares since during and  we entered into contracts to hedge gold commodity price risks through february as of september   we did not have any outstanding derivative contracts on our consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional information on our derivative instruments 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total debt interest expense capital leases operating leases total as of september   the liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
holders of our  par value outstanding notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  during  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
at the time of the repurchase the notes had a book value of  which includes the par value of the notes  offset by the remaining debt discount of  we currently have  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
investments we account for securities available for sale in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance regarding accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires that available for sale and trading securities be carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses deemed to be temporary on available for sale securities are reported as other comprehensive income oci within shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses and decline in value deemed to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in loss gain on short and long term investments and other income on our consolidated statements of operations 
trading gains and losses also are included in loss gain on short and long term investments 
fair value of the securities is based upon quoted market prices in active markets or estimated fair value when quoted market prices are not available 
the cost basis for realized gains and losses on available for sale securities is determined on a specific identification basis 
we classify our securities available for sale as short or long term based upon management s intent and ability to hold these investments 
in addition  throughout  the fasb issued various authoritative guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which help in determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
our impairment analysis for the fourth quarter of indicated that no charge for impairment was required 
based on our forecast model  there was a cushion in excess of between our expected undiscounted cash flows and the carrying value of our assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
the fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under the guidance  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our debt obligations that are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of approximately  our investing activities are guided by an investment policy  which is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors  and whose objectives are preservation and safety of capital  maintenance of necessary liquidity and maximizing of the rate of return within the stated guidelines 
our policy provides guidelines as to the maturity  concentration limits and credit quality of our investments  as well as guidelines for communication  authorized securities and other policies and procedures in connection with our investing activities 
we are exposed to various market risks and potential loss arising from changes in interest rates in connection with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in investment accounts
