item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are a diversified reit that invests primarily in single tenant commercial real estate assets subject to long term leases to high credit quality tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease 
see business overview for what constitutes a net lease 
we also have made and expect to continue to make investments in single tenant properties where the owner has exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
we have two complementary business lines owning single tenant properties and making first mortgage loans and other debt investments on single tenant properties 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments loans and securities 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
we expect our leverage levels to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction including through selected asset sales  and lower leverage on new asset acquisitions 
as a result of market conditions  the focus of our portfolio activity during and was reducing primarily recourse debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
during  we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment and or repurchase and also opportunistically resume portfolio growth as market conditions permit 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party non recourse mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two non recourse term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
we have also financed certain of our assets on a non match funded floating rate recourse credit agreement 
as discussed in greater detail under business environment below  credit market conditions have adversely impacted our company in a variety of ways  including by causing us to suspend growth  significantly curtailing our access to credit and capital on attractive terms and causing us to finance a portion of our long term fixed rate assets on a non match funded  floating rate  recourse credit agreement 
in response to market conditions we have refocused our strategy in a number of ways  including by reducing our debt levels  selectively selling assets  intensively managing our portfolio and reducing our general and administrative expenses 
we do not know when conditions will normalize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
summary of investment and financing activity in as a result of market conditions  we did not add any new assets to our portfolio during  other than some nominal securities investments we made through the reinvestment feature of our cdo 
instead  the focus of our portfolio activity during was reducing primarily recourse debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
during  we retired million of principal on our debt  including million of borrowings to wachovia bank 
during  we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment and or repurchase and also opportunistically resume portfolio growth as market conditions permit 
business environment while conditions within the united states credit markets in general and united states real estate credit markets in particular have improved from the historic levels of dislocation and stress that began in the summer of  these markets remain significantly stressed 
credit conditions continue to impact us in a variety of ways  including by making it difficult for us to price and finance new investment opportunities on attractive terms 
as a result of market conditions  we have not been adding new asset investments to our investment portfolio 
causing us to preserve our liquidity rather than make new investments due to the limited availability of debt or equity capital on attractive terms 
causing a delay in the long term fixed rate financing of the mortgage assets financed under our recourse credit agreement with wachovia bank 
we expect credit market conditions to continue to impact our ability to obtain long term fixed rate financing and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so 
further  to the extent we continue to finance a portion of our portfolio through the credit agreement with wachovia bank  that agreement is recourse to all of our other assets  we will continue to be subject to potential margin calls from the lender primarily for credit events related to the assets financed and we will be subject to interest rate risk as the borrowings are priced at floating rates based on day libor  or the london interbank offered rate 
increases in libor rates will cause our borrowing costs on the wachovia credit agreement to increase 
causing us to sell selected assets to reduce debt and generate liquidity 
credit market conditions and limited market trading activity for real estate securities continue to result in depressed valuations on our real estate securities 
if these conditions do not improve  we may be required to record impairment losses on our securities  and these losses may be significant 
we do not know when market conditions will normalize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
if market weakness persists or intensifies  the trends discussed above may continue and we may be impacted in a variety of additional ways 
for example  we may experience challenges in refinancing debt as it matures or raising additional capital  margin calls on our wachovia bank credit agreement and impairment charges on our assets 
if weak economic conditions continue and capital for commercial real estate remains limited  certain collateral within our cdo may default  which could cause the cdo to fail to satisfy certain cash flow coverage tests  which would result in a redirection of the cash distributions payable to us from the cdo until the tests are back into compliance 
we have taken and may continue to take a variety of cash conservation measures such as asset sales  expense reductions and dividend adjustments to increase our liquidity levels until credit markets normalize 
our ability to sell collateral to generate liquidity could also be impacted by factors such as market conditions  the relative illiquidity of certain of our assets ie  our owned property and loan investments and limitations on sale imposed pursuant to the debt financing terms of our assets 
current economic and credit market conditions may cause commercial real estate values and market rental rates to decline significantly 
these declines could adversely impact us in a number of ways  including by causing us to record losses on our assets  reducing the proceeds we receive upon sale or refinance of our assets or adversely impacting our ability to re let  sell or refinance our owned properties 
current economic conditions have contributed to unexpected bankruptcies and rapid declines in financial condition at a number of companies  particularly in the retail and financial sectors 
these conditions could cause one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure to fail or default in their payment obligations  which could cause us to record material losses or a material reduction in our revenue and cash flows 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment on owned real properties 
we are required under gaap to review our owned properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon determination of impairment  we would record a write down of the asset  which would be charged to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting write down  including an evaluation of factors such as the credit quality of the tenant  the anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  and an estimate of what lease rents will be if the property is vacated coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
we recorded impairment losses on our owned properties of million in including million on the write down to estimated fair value of a property in johnston  rhode island that is now vacant and million on the sale of one property and expected sale of another during 
we also recognized impairment losses on our owned properties of million in impairment of loan investments 
we are required under gaap to periodically evaluate each of our loan investments for possible impairment 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  our impairment analysis includes both a general reserve component on performing loans and an asset specific component on loans where we have deemed it probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
significant judgment is required in the analysis of each component  including under the general reserve component making estimates of the likelihood of default and lease rejection given the credit characteristics of the tenant  and estimates of stressed collateral values and potential bankruptcy claim recoveries  and under the asset specific component evaluating factors such as the status of the loans ie  current or expected payment or other defaults  the credit quality of the underlying tenants  the present value of expected future cash flows on the loans  the fair market value of our collateral  and the amount and status of any senior debt 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
as of december   we had a general loan loss reserve of million established in and an asset specific loan loss reserve related to a mezzanine loan investment of million established in 
commercial mortgage backed securities 
under applicable accounting guidance  we estimate the fair value on our investments in securities quarterly 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  index pricing  market yields and credit spreads on securities with similar credit ratings and duration  collateral values  and liquidity of the security 
our estimates of fair value are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and credit spreads 
we are then required under gaap to assess whether any unrealized losses on securities below our carry value reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if an other than temporarily impaired security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount  the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings 
otherwise  losses on the security must be separated into two categories  the portion which is considered credit loss  which is charged to earnings  and the portion due to other factors  which is charged to other comprehensive income loss  a component of balance sheet equity 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
current credit market conditions have made these judgments even more challenging 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads indicator of temporary decline or credit rating downgrades on the securities or credit defaults on the underlying collateral assets indicator of an other than temporary decline 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers a variety of factors including the financial condition and near term prospects of the credit  including credit rating of the security and the underlying tenant and an estimate of the likelihood and expected timing of any default  whether we expect to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  current market conditions  expected cash flows from the underlying collateral and an estimate of underlying collateral values  and subordination levels within the securitization pool 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
we recorded other than temporary declines in the fair value of our cmbs securities of million in  million in and million for stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize 
property acquisitions during the quarter ended december   we did not make any new investments 
we also did not complete any new asset financings 
business segments we conduct our business through two operating segments operating real estate including our investments in owned real properties  and lending investments including our loan investments as well as our investments in securities 
segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses gain on extinguishment of debt provision for income tax loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  was basically unchanged  as it decreased million  or less than one percent  to million 
while we had one tenant vacancy during johnston  rhode island property  the impact on revenue during was modest as the tenant held over for three months beyond the scheduled lease maturity in july and paid higher rent during the holdover period 
we expect rental revenue to be adversely impacted by the vacancy of the johnston  rhode island property during october and the lease termination and related sublease maturities at the omaha  nebraska properties during and interest income decreased million  or  to million during  primarily as a result of lower loan balances and lower interest rates on cash balances 
other revenue increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the lease termination payment we received on the omaha  nebraska properties during expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and various other expenses in the period  offset in part by higher investment losses in the period 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease in the period resulted primarily from million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings and interest rates in the period  million of lower interest expense on convertible debt due to repurchases of the convertible debt  million of lower interest expense on property mortgages and million of lower interest expense on the secured term loan 
the company s average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under its floating rate borrowings was approximately million at during the period average day libor of  compared with approximately million at during the period average day libor of 
market interest rates were low during but we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to the value of our in place lease on the property in johnston  rhode island being fully amortized at the scheduled lease maturity in july property expense increased million  or  to million  reflecting increased expenses including costs paid to one of our tenants and real estate taxes 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million  compared to million in we had no loss on derivatives in  compared to a million loss on derivatives in the period 
the loss in the period relates primarily to million of losses we realized in november when we closed our only open hedge position 
as of december  and during most of  we had a single open interest rate swap  intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements for a planned long term financing of assets financed on our credit agreement with wachovia bank 
during november  we closed the swap as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates 
the full amount of the realized loss on closing the swap of million  along with million of related losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet  were charged directly to our consolidated statement of operations  as the swap position no longer represented an effective cash flow hedge under applicable accounting guidance 
we currently have no open hedge positions and did not have any open hedge positions during loss on investments was million in  compared to million in the losses reflect a million impairment loss on the johnston  rhode island property that is now vacant see note  an aggregate of million of impairment losses on four assets that were sold during two loans  one property and one security and one asset that is expected to be sold in cott property see note  of impairment losses on a mezzanine loan investment see note  and of impairment losses on a security investment see note 
losses in reflect a million write off of the investment in matapeake in the fourth quarter  a million impairment loss on securities investments in the fourth quarter see note  a million write off of a development loan in the third quarter  a million general reserve for loan losses in the fourth quarter see note  and a million impairment loss on the cott property in the third quarter see note 
general and administrative expense decreased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting higher legal expenses in the period related to our legal actions involving the real property we own in johnston  rhode island 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million 
the increase was primarily a result of an additional year of stock awards and an increase in estimated vesting percentage in the period  offset in part by reduced amortization expense related to the vesting of prior year awards 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in and  restricted shares made in  has not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in  compared to million in the period 
gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes and cdo debt see note 
gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes in december see note net loss 
net loss decreased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of lower interest expense in the period 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental revenue 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
the increase was driven by a full year of rental revenue from the entrecap portfolio which was acquired in april interest income was basically unchanged  decreasing million  or  to million 
expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to the large loss on derivatives  and higher levels of depreciation and amortization expense on real property  loss on investments  general and administrative expenses  property expenses and interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of additional interest expense on the secured term loan we issued in december  million of additional interest expense on the convertible senior notes we issued in october  and million of additional interest expense on property mortgages  partially offset by million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings and interest rates in and the impact in of million of fees and million of interest expense under the bridge facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition of the entrecap portfolio in april 
our average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under our floating rate borrowings other than the bridge facility was approximately million at during average day libor of  compared with approximately million at during average day libor of 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or  to million  as a result of the additional real estate investments made during property expense increased million  or  to million 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million  compared to million in we had a million loss on derivatives in the period  compared to of income in the period 
the loss in the period is discussed in the comparison of and results above 
loss on investments increased million  to million in  from million in the losses in are discussed in the comparison of and results above 
losses in reflect impairment losses on two cmbs securities during the second quarter of see note 
management determined that other than temporary declines in the fair value below cost basis had occurred on these two investments 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting higher legal expenses associated with litigation  including the actions we brought related to the real property we own in johnston  rhode island 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million  as a result of an additional year of stock awards amortizing to expense in  offset in part by a lower vesting percentage for performance based awards in as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  shares made in   shares made in   shares made in and  shares made in  had not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in  compared to million in the period 
gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes in december  and the gains in the period related to our retirement of debt we assumed when we purchased the entrecap portfolio 
the gains in the period resulted from interest rate changes between the date we assumed the debt and the date it was repaid 
net loss 
net loss increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of the loss on derivatives in the period 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of an equity reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income loss allocable to common stockholders to ffo for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss allocable to common stockholders add deduct non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries depreciation and amortization expense on real property depreciation and amortization expense on discontinued operations funds from operations weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted weighted average number of op units outstanding weighted average number of common shares and op units outstanding  diluted net loss per common share  basic and diluted funds from operations per share liquidity and capital resources we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
leverage also exposes us to a variety of risks which are discussed in more detail in this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
we expect our leverage levels to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction including through selected asset sales  and lower leverage on new asset acquisitions 
as a result of market conditions  the focus of our portfolio activity during and was reducing primarily recourse debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
during  we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment and or repurchase and also opportunistically resume portfolio growth as market conditions permit 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party non recourse mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two non recourse term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately billion of portfolio assets with third party mortgage debt of million and term financings of million 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including per share in each of the first  second and third quarters  and per share in the fourth quarter 
we declared a dividend of per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters of our dividend policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our cash available for distribution  our funds from operations  our maintenance of reit status  market conditions and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
short term liquidity and financing 
we define our short term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet day to day operating expenses and material cash commitments over the next twelve months 
our primary sources of short term liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and a portion of the cash proceeds from issuances of debt and equity capital 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our sources of short term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  including the payment of our dividend 
while we believe we will be able to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  the following are the primary factors that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our plans payment defaults on our assets which we expect could be triggered primarily in the event of the bankruptcy of the underlying tenant or tenants  unexpected capital expenditures on our owned properties  margin calls on our wachovia credit agreement  or margin calls on any future risk management transactions 
long term liquidity and financing 
we define our long term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet cash demands and commitments beyond the next months  including balloon payments on our debt obligations and capital expenditures on our owned properties 
our primary sources of long term liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  cash from long term financings on our asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
we have begun and may continue to selectively sell assets to allow us to generate additional long term liquidity 
we believe that our various sources of long term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
our primary long term liquidity requirement is repayment of our debt obligations 
we intend generally to manage our debt maturities by refinancing or repaying the related debt at maturity 
we expect to utilize a combination of i cash on hand  ii cash from sales of assets which may include the collateral for the debt  and iii cash from future debt or equity capital raises to fund any liquidity needed to satisfy these obligations 
these actions  however  may not enable us to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our borrowings and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay our debt obligations as they come due 
our ability to refinance debt  sell assets and or raise capital on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
see item a risk factors our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have two recourse debt obligations that will mature over the next few years 
our credit agreement with wachovia bank is scheduled to mature in april and our convertible senior notes can be called for repurchase at the option of the note holders at of the principal amount of the notes in october the credit agreement with wachovia bank is a secured borrowing agreement and the convertible senior notes are unsecured obligations 
with respect to the wachovia bank agreement  we have begun and will continue to seek a longer term extension or refinancing of this facility with wachovia 
we may also seek to refinance this facility with a variety of other lenders 
with respect to the convertible notes  we will continue to seek to opportunistically repurchase this debt over time and then intend to repay or refinance any remaining obligation at or prior to maturity 
while we believe we will be successful in either refinancing or repaying these obligations at or prior to maturity  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to do so 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing these obligations  we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the debt in full at maturity 
our failure to do so is a default under the debt and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in a variety of ways 
for example  if we default under the wachovia agreement  the bank could foreclose on its collateral causing us to lose some of our assets 
wachovia and the convertible note holders also would have general recourse against our company if we default in our obligations to them 
in addition  each of these obligations is cross defaulted with the other  meaning that a default under one obligation could result in the other lender accelerating the maturity of our obligations to them 
as an owner of commercial real estate  we will be required to make capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our properties 
we expect the vast majority of these expenditures will be made as the leases mature and we renew existing leases or find new tenants to occupy the property 
any estimates we make of expected capital expenditures are highly subjective and actual amounts we spend may differ materially and will be impacted by a variety of factors  including market conditions which are beyond our control 
our ability to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements could be materially adversely affected by capital expenditures we make on our owned properties 
sources of equity capital we have implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan and an at the market offering program as defined in rule of the securities act of  as amended  each of which may be utilized by us from time to time to sell shares of our common stock and increase liquidity 
in march  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the plan allows interested stockholders to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of our common stock and to make monthly purchases of our common stock generally up to a maximum of  unless a higher amount is approved by us in our sole discretion 
shares purchased through the plan may be either i newly issued by us or ii purchased by the plan administrator in the open market  at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
as of december   we have reserved an aggregate of  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
we filed a registration statement with the sec to increase the plan size by  shares to  shares  during december that registration statement was declared effective by the sec and the increased plan size became effective during january we are not currently issuing new shares through the plan  although we reserve the right to elect to do so in our sole discretion at any time in the future 
in october  we entered into a new sales agreement with brinson patrick securities corporation that permits us to issue and sell through brinson patrick  from time to time  up to  shares of our common stock  and brinson patrick agrees to use its best efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and on the terms set forth therein 
we must pay brinson patrick a commission ranging from to of the gross sales price per share sold  depending upon the aggregate proceeds raised by them 
the sales agreement replaces the sales agreement dated as of august   between us and brinson patrick  which initially authorized the issuance and sale by us of up to  shares of common stock and had been fully utilized by us 
we began selling shares pursuant to the new sales agreement during december we may at any time suspend solicitation and offers pursuant to the new sales agreement or terminate the new sales agreement 
we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock through the at the market offering program at an average price of per share  during the quarter ended december   and an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an average price of per share  during the year ended december  brinson patrick acted as our agent for these sales and received a sales commission on the sales 
we raised net proceeds of approximately million during the year ended december   and we used the proceeds to replenish cash that had been used to fund repurchases of outstanding debt 
we have continued to utilize the at the market offering program during between january  and march   we have issued and sold another  shares of common stock through the program at an average price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we have an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time  including an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for sale under the october brinson patrick sales agreement 
we intend to continue to raise additional capital from time to time to enable us to continue to implement our strategy 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you that conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
long term mortgage financings 
we have financed most of our owned properties through traditional mortgage financings provided through the commercial mortgage backed securitization market 
we also have utilized the term financings described below to add incremental leverage on many of our owned properties 
during the year ended december   we did not obtain any new mortgage financings 
our mortgage financings are all fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are non recourse to us subject to limited recourse exceptions and are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes are often interest only for all or a portion of the note term  and thus require a balloon payment at maturity 
as described above  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay these obligations at maturity and our ability to do so on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions

we have financed most of our loan and securities investments as well as a select number of our owned properties through the term financings described below 
as noted above  we have also utilized term financings to add incremental leverage on our owned properties financed with mortgage debt 
in december  we completed a million original principal balance secured term loan 
upon closing of the financing  we pledged approximately million principal amount of collateral to secure our obligations under the loan 
the interest coupon on the loan is fixed at annually until the loan matures in january our effective financing rate on the loan is annually inclusive of hedge and closing costs 
the loan is non recourse to us  subject to limited non recourse exceptions 
we also completed an entirely fixed rate cdo financing in march we aggregated approximately million face amount of assets and then transferred these assets into a wholly owned securitization vehicle  and issued million face amount of multi class notes and million of preferred equity through the securitization vehicle 
the assets serve as collateral for our obligations under the notes 
the securitization vehicle is an spe  with its business limited to the issuance of the notes and the preferred equity  the acquisition of the collateral and certain other matters related thereto 
the net amount of the debt we initially issued was million  inclusive of a million discount to face  as we retained the three most junior note classes aggregating a face amount of million and the full million of preferred equity 
each of the five note classes of the cdo was and continues to be rated investment grade 
the reinvestment period for the cdo which allowed us to reinvest principal payments on the underlying assets into qualifying replacement collateral expired during october the cdo notes have a stated maturity in january  although the actual life of the notes is expected to be substantially shorter 
our weighted average effective financing rate inclusive of original issue discount and debt issuance and hedge costs on our cdo is approximately 
our cdo debt is non recourse to us but is secured by the collateral assets 
we reduced the debt outstanding under our cdo by repurchasing million of our class a cdo notes during the year ended december  we have financed certain of our portfolio assets pursuant to a credit agreement we entered into with wachovia bank in april we drew a million term loan under the agreement at closing which we have reduced to million outstanding as of december  our borrowings are scheduled to mature in april the agreement is a floating rate libor based facility 
we are required to pay interest on our borrowings at prevailing short term rates day libor plus a pricing spread ranging from to basis points 
our borrowings under the facility are secured by a combination of first mortgage loan investments  intercompany mortgage loans on our owned property investments  commercial mortgage backed securities and a first lien on our ownership interest in the real property located in johnston  rhode island 
our obligations under the credit agreement are also fully recourse to all of our other assets and  pursuant to the margin call provisions in the agreement  we may be obligated to prepay a portion of the debt if wachovia determines the value of our collateral has declined  including as a result of an underlying tenant credit rating downgrade or other adverse tenant credit event  wachovia may require us to prepay a portion of our borrowings  provided that wachovia may not reduce the value of any of our collateral other than cmbs securities due to general credit spread or interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   we had million borrowed against collateral classified as cmbs securities by wachovia 
we are required to comply with the following financial covenants under the credit agreement minimum liquidity as defined in the agreement of at least million  and minimum consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of at least million plus of the aggregate net proceeds from equity offerings or capital contributions after september  we had million outstanding as of december  under our wachovia credit agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans and investments in our cdo with an aggregate carry value of million  cmbs investments with a carry value of million and a single owned property with a carry value of million 
we intend to continue to pursue a variety of strategies for the assets financed on the facility  which may include obtaining longer term floating rate financing  obtaining long term fixed rate financing when market conditions permit  pursuing selected asset sales  and retiring the debt on selected assets and holding the assets unlevered 
we expect credit market conditions to impact our ability to achieve these objectives and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so 
statement of cash flows operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net loss as adjusted by various non cash gains  losses  income and charges of million  partially offset by increases in other assets of million

we recognize rental income on our owned properties on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   this has resulted in us accruing million of rental income in excess of actual rents due under the various leases 
during the year ended december   rents on a straight line basis exceeded actual rents due under the leases by million 
we expect the impact of straight lining of rents to fluctuate over time as contractual rents step up and actual rents due increase under the various leases and we purchase additional properties 
certain of our owned properties are also subject to rents which pay semi annually  rather than monthly  and this also impacts the quarter to quarter changes due to straight lining of rents

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we may attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk in various aspects of our business 
the most significant ways we can be impacted by interest rates are as follows increases in the level of interest rates may impact our ability to add new assets  as spreads on assets we are targeting may compress unless there is a corresponding increase in asset returns and demand for our products may be adversely affected 
also  to the extent we finance assets in our portfolio on our floating rate borrowing facilities  our net income from these fixed rate assets will decrease as interest rates rise particularly libor rates and our borrowing cost increases 
our wachovia bank credit facility is currently our only floating rate borrowing facility 
low market interest rates kept our borrowing cost on the wachovia credit facility low during and we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
in addition  as interest rates rise  our anticipated cost to finance these assets on a long term fixed rate basis may rise  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced 
we may attempt to mitigate these risks by entering into risk management transactions that react in a manner that offsets our increased interest costs and by locking our long term financing cost as soon as practicable after we commit to an asset 
as a result of market conditions  we are not currently carrying an open interest rate hedge to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for assets for which we may obtain long term financing for in the future 
our decision to do so leaves us exposed to increases in long term interest rates for those assets and  therefore  may make it more difficult or more costly to obtain long term financing 
as noted above  there can be no assurance that our mitigation strategies will be successful 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our loans and real estate securities 
changes in the required yield would result in a higher or lower value for these assets 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value may affect the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the losses to be other than temporary  our statement of operations through impairment losses on our loans or securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
credit spread curve exposure we are subject to credit spread risk in various aspects of our business 
credit spreads represent the portion of the required yield on an income investment attributable to credit quality 
credit spreads fluctuate over time as investor appetite for credit risk changes 
changes in credit spreads can have many of the same impacts on us as a change in interest rates  or principally increases in credit spreads can result in spread compression on investments we target and  thus  a slowing of our new investment pace  increases in credit spreads can increase our anticipated cost to finance assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced  and increases in credit spreads can lower the value of our loans and securities as required yields on these assets increase 
market conditions since the summer of have resulted in increases in credit spreads and generally lower fair valuations for our securities 
if these conditions continue or persist  we may be required to record impairment losses on our securities  and these losses may be significant 
tenant credit rating exposure substantially all of our portfolio assets are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the underlying tenant or tenants 
deterioration in the underlying tenant s credit rating can result in a lower value for the related asset  which could result in a reduction in the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the loss to be other than temporary  an impairment loss on our statement of operations 
in addition  declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term fixed rate financing could result in a margin call by the related lender  and precipitous declines may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage these risks by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
any sales we make may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and december   as the case may be  and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the underlying tenants

we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans based on sales of loans with similar credit and structural characteristics where available  and management s estimate of fair values where comparable sales information is not available 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through commercial mortgage backed securities represent subordinate interests in securitizations  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans collectively  cmbs 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
the fair values of cmbs reflect management s best estimate and require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  index pricing  market yields and credit spreads on securities with similar credit ratings and duration  collateral values  and liquidity of the security 
fair value for the structuring fees receivable is shown at our amortized cost for these items 
for the cmbs  we expect to receive monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
our credit facility bears interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments  collateralized debt obligations and the secured term loan using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value 
the maturity date of the collateralized debt obligations of january reflects the first date the auction call mechanism in the notes is triggered and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate 
the carry value and effective financing rate on the convertible senior notes reflect the impact of the new accounting guidance applicable to the notes as of january  see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we estimate the fair value of our convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates  and indications of market yields  where available 
the maturity date of our convertible senior notes reflects our expected maturity date in october when the note investors have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate
