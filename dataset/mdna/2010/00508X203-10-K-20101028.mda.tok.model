item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a diversified global manufacturer of a broad range of industrial products and systems  organized into four reportable segments  industrial  energy  electrical and engineered solutions 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance  industrial  infrastructure and production automation markets 
the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services  as well as umbilical  rope and cable solutions to the global oil gas  power generation and energy markets 
the electrical segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy  wholesale  oem  utility and harsh environment markets 
the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets  as well as a variety of other industrial products 
business update results of operations for fiscal reflect improved sales trends  operating profit margin expansion driven by increased production volumes and savings from restructuring activities  strong cash flow generation  continued progress on restructuring projects and the completion of four tuck in acquisitions 
the following is a summary of the recent developments and trends in each of our segments industrial segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the industrial segment sales trend improved significantly  with core sales growth of compared to core sales growth in the third quarter driven by improved demand across all geographic regions 
this segment continues to focus on driving sales growth through the introduction of new products  market share gains penetration into emerging markets and geographies and strategic acquisitions including two business acquisitions completed during fiscal 
the considerable improvement in fourth quarter operating profit margins  despite unfavorable acquisition mix  was driven by increased sales levels  a reduced cost structure and the benefits from restructuring activities 
energy segment being a later cycle business  our energy segment was the last of the four segments to be impacted by the global recession and generated core sales growth for the first three quarters of fiscal however  since then it has reported quarterly core sales declines in the to range 
similar to other energy service providers  sales trends continue to be negatively impacted by the deferral of maintenance and capital spending activities by our customers  especially those in the refining business 
in response to the reduced sales and profitability levels over the past several quarters  we initiated various restructuring actions to centralize certain selling and administrative functions and rationalize manufacturing operations within this segment 
despite the difficult market conditions that continue to exist in the energy segment  operating profit margins excluding restructuring costs improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarters of fiscal electrical segment the electrical segment  which had experienced quarterly core sales declines since the first quarter of fiscal  returned to positive core sales growth in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the improvement in the core sales trend core sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by improved end market demand from marine and transformer customers 
other served markets  including commercial construction and electric utilities  which are later cycle in nature  continue to be weak 
in response to last year s economic slow down  this segment completed various actions to address its cost structure including reductions in workforce  consolidation of facilities and management  as well as product sourcing initiatives 
the significant year over year and sequential improvement in operating profit excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter are directly attributable to these restructuring actions 
engineered solutions segment engineered solutions segment core sales growth was in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which continued the recent trend of strong core sales growth 
the improvement in core sales growth is the result of increased demand from vehicle oems truck  auto and specialty and prior year sales volumes being negatively impacted by significant inventory destocking by oems 
a reduced cost 
table of contents structure from previously completed restructuring actions and the additional sales volumes improved absorption of manufacturing costs resulted in incremental operating margins and higher profits during the fourth quarter 
despite the challenging economic conditions that existed in early fiscal  we continued to generate substantial cash flows from operations  delivered improved financial results and completed key restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure and position the business for future growth as the economy recovers 
our priorities in fiscal include the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions  cash flow generation and a focus on growth initiatives to capitalize on niche markets and emerging economies  strengthen existing market positions and expand product offerings through new product development

most of our businesses and end markets started experiencing the impact of the economic downturn during the second quarter of fiscal in response to this slowdown in business  we took actions to address our cost structure  including workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions 
given the improved economic conditions in calendar  the benefits of restructuring activities and the fact that we believe we have anniversaried the weakest point during the economic downturn  sales and profitability comparisons improved in the second half of fiscal  reflecting the benefit of higher sales and improved profit margins

electrical segment electrical segment operating profit increased by million  to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the prior year period including a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the harsh environment electrical business and million of incremental restructuring charges 
excluding these charges  the improvement in operating profit primarily reflected restructuring related cost savings as we realized the benefits of facility consolidations  reduced headcount and the movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries

engineered solutions segment engineered solutions segment operating profit decreased by million from million for fiscal to an operating loss of million for fiscal the operating results for fiscal were adversely impacted by million of restructuring costs and a million non cash rv goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
fiscal operating results were also significantly impacted by lower sales and production levels resulting in decreased absorption of fixed costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rate changes 
general corporate general corporate expenses decreased by million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to lower incentive compensation expense  headcount reductions and the benefit of other cost reduction efforts 
restructuring charges in fiscal and  the company committed to various restructuring initiatives including workforce reductions  plant consolidations to reduce manufacturing overhead  the continued movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions 
total restructuring costs for these activities were million and million for the year ended august  and  respectively 
we believe these restructuring actions  which were substantially complete by august   will better align our resources with strategic growth opportunities  optimize existing manufacturing 
table of contents capabilities  improve our overall cost structure and deliver increased free cash flow and profitability 
these restructuring actions are expected to generate million of annual cost savings 
see note  restructuring in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment charges significant adverse developments in the rv market during the first quarter of fiscal  including sharply lower wholesale motorhome shipments by oem s  decreased consumer confidence and the lack of financing available to rv dealers and retail customers negatively impacted the financial results of our rv business 
as a result  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash impairment charge related to the goodwill and long lived assets of the rv business engineered solutions segment 
difficult economic conditions  low consumer confidence  increased unemployment and tight credit markets during the third quarter of fiscal  also negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending  resulting in a substantial reduction in recreational boating industry sales 
during  oem boat builders responded to the sharp drop in demand and high levels of finished goods inventory by temporarily suspending operations as well as eliminating brands and permanently closing facilities 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and long lived assets of the harsh environment electrical business electrical segment 
approximately million of the impairment charge is included in the loss from discontinued operations 
see note  impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as a result of an overall weak european economy  low consumer confidence and reduced demand in the retail diy markets  the company committed to a plan to divest its european electrical business during the fourth quarter of fiscal the european electrical business designs  manufactures and markets electrical sockets  switches and other tools and consumables  predominately in the european diy retail market 
this planned divestiture is also part of the company s portfolio management process to focus on businesses that create the most shareholder value 
as a result  a million non cash asset impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal to adjust the carrying value of the asset group to fair value 
see note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
financing costs  net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and therefore financing costs have not been allocated to our segments 
the million year over year decrease in financing costs in fiscal reflects substantially lower average debt levels and reduced interest rates on variable rate debt 
income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax expense recognized in fiscal benefited from foreign tax credits  increased taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the us statutory rate and favorable changes in valuation allowances offset somewhat by unfavorable provision to return adjustments and additional provisions for unrecognized tax benefits 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal  relative to fiscal  reflects the tax benefit on the impairment and restructuring charges being recognized at the domestic tax rate which is higher than our consolidated global effective tax rate 
in addition  the effective income tax rate for fiscal includes the benefit of income tax reserve adjustments resulting from settling tax audits for amounts less than previously accrued and the lapsing of various tax statutes of limitations 

table of contents discontinued operations as a result of our plan to divest the european electrical business  the assets and liabilities of the business are considered held for sale at august  and therefore the financial results are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations also reflect the results of the acme aerospace and bh electronics  inc businesses  which were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal for net cash proceeds of million 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations in millions year ended august  net sales net gain on disposal loss from operations of discontinued businesses income tax expense benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax includes non cash asset impairment charges of million european electrical and million bh electronics in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating  investing and financing activities for the three years ended august  in millions year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities were million 
excluding the million negative impact on working capital due to the expiration of the accounts receivable securitization program  net cash provided by operating activities increased relative to the prior year as a result of increased earnings from continuing operations  effective working capital management and the receipt of income tax refunds 
these operating cash flows and the million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the european electrical product line in the second quarter  funded million of acquisitions and million of capital expenditures  while reducing net debt by million 
effective cash flow management during fiscal resulted in substantial cash flow from operating activities of million and an improved financial position at august  operating cash flows benefited from lower working capital requirements  especially accounts receivable  given the decline in sales levels 
during fiscal  cash flows from operations  along with the million proceeds from the follow on equity offering and million of proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses  funded million of strategic acquisitions including the acquisition of the cortland companies  million of capital expenditures and a net reduction in debt of million 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities  driven by net earnings of million  which included non cash expenses principally depreciation and amortization of million 
the net 
table of contents earnings were somewhat offset by additional working capital requirements of million 
these operating cash flows funded million of capital expenditures and million of capital deployment in two strategic acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  consisting primarily of proceeds and the related tax benefits from stock option exercises 
borrowings on the revolving credit facility during fiscal were repaid by august  primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable  outstanding balances on the accounts receivable securitization facility  and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net accounts receivable securitization total accounts receivable inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital our net primary working capital percentage decreased year over year from to  the combined result of the increase in sales and the continued focus on effective working capital management 
excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  accounts receivable increased million and inventory increased million due to the accelerated ramp up in production and improved economic conditions in certain end markets we serve  while accounts payable balances increased million 
liquidity the senior credit facility  which matures on november   consists of a million revolving credit facility  is secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property assets and bears interest of libor plus 
the two financial covenants included in the senior credit facility agreement are a maximum leverage ratio of and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of we were in compliance with all debt covenants at august  holders of our convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase  for cash  all or a portion of the convertible notes on november   november  and november  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
if certain conditions are met  holders may also convert the convertible notes into shares of our common stock prior to the november maturity date 
in addition  we may redeem all or part of the convertible notes on or after november  at a cash redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
we will fund any put of the convertible notes through revolver borrowings under the senior credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we repurchased on the open market million of convertible notes and during the first quarter of fiscal  we repurchased an additional million of convertible notes 
see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the repurchases 
at august   we had million of cash and no borrowings under our million revolver 
approximately million of the revolver was available for borrowing  based on credit agreement terms 
we believe that this cash and revolver availability  combined with funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet operating  debt service  acquisition funding and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under our senior credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
no single customer generated or more of fiscal  and net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under the senior credit facility 
fiscal capital expenditures were unusually high due to construction of our new million china manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  we pay the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable us to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the contractual obligations table below for further information 
we are contingently liable for certain lease agreements held by businesses included in our former electronics segment  which was spun off to shareholders in fiscal some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  we could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for these leases was million at august  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at august  and  respectively  the majority of which secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable securitization in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we were a party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement whereby we sold certain trade receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary  which in turn  sold participating interests in the receivables to a third party financial institution 
we did not renew the securitization program on its september  maturity date and  as a result  utilized availability under the senior credit facility to fund the corresponding million increase in accounts receivable 

table of contents contractual obligations the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows in millions payments due thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases acquisition purchase price payable the above table includes deferred purchase price and contingent consideration related to acquisitions  completed in fiscal and previous years 
we made payments on past acquisitions totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for further information see note  acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the contractual obligation schedule for long term debt assumes we do not call the remaining convertible notes or have them put back to us in fiscal for further information  see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our operating lease obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services including software and hardware support services and leases and telecommunications services 
those obligations that are not cancelable are included in the table 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  they are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
we have long term obligations related to our deferred compensation  pension and postretirement plans at august  excluded from the contractual obligations table 
our liabilities related to these plans are summarized in note  employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million at august  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was not included in the table of contractual obligations above because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated 
raw material costs and inflation we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
additionally  many of our components are sourced from low cost countries  in currencies different than the functional currency of the acquiring business 
potential changes in exchange rates also create variations in material costs that could reduce our profitability 
we strive to offset such cost inflation by price increases to customers and driving operational cost reductions and improvement 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
however we did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august  or see our risk factors for additional information on the company s commodity risks 
no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations  after factoring in price increases and other manufacturing cost reductions 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by million at both august  and we perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
we believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair value method based on our judgments and assumptions 
the estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  we use a discounted cash flow model  which is dependent on a number of assumptions including estimated future revenues and expenses  weighted average cost of capital  capital expenditures and other variables 
the estimated fair value is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the annual impairment testing performed at august  for continuing operations indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and  as such  no impairment existed 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets  based on a relief of royalty model  are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required 
we also review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
refer to note  discontinued operations and note  impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions or adverse market developments could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health benefits 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on an august measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is based on the interest rate of non callable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of local market factors  participant demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact domestic benefit plan expense in fiscal by less than million 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on foreign benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns on plan assets  forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock  index funds and bond funds 
the expected return on domestic 
table of contents benefit plan assets was and at august  and  respectively 
a basis point change in this assumption would impact fiscal domestic benefit plan expense by less than million 
due to the limited amount of foreign benefit plan assets  changes in the expected return on plan assets does not materially impact our results of operations 
we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense also reflects best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and the effect of various tax planning strategies 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded 
use of estimates we record reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental matters  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
we base our estimates on historical experience  input from third party advisors and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that such estimates are made on a consistent basis and with appropriate assumptions and methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to accounting standards codification asc no 
 earnings per share  which concluded that unvested share based awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and  therefore  must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
outstanding unvested share based awards restricted stock awards granted under the actuant corporation and stock plans are participating securities as they contain non forfeitable rights to dividends 
the application of the two class method in computing basic and dilutive earnings per share  effective september   did not have a material impact on the weighted average shares outstanding or earnings per share amounts 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc no 
 consolidations  which changed the accounting and reporting for non controlling minority interests 
the company has one joint venture with a non controlling interest  which is not significant to the company s financial position and results of operations 
as a result  the adoption of this guidance on september  did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc no 
 business combinations  which changed the accounting for certain aspects of business combinations  including the treatment of contingent consideration  pre acquisition contingencies  transaction costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
this guidance also requires adjustments associated with changes in deferred tax balances or tax contingencies  that occur after the one year measurement period  be recorded as adjustments to income tax expense 
asc no 
was effective for the company for all acquisitions after september   however  the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of changes in income tax balances was applied retrospectively to all business combinations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
currency risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of those us dollar denominated amounts  approximately were denominated in euro  with the remainder denominated in british pounds and various asian and other currencies 
our identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
we periodically identify areas where we do not have naturally occurring offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect against anticipated exposures 
at august  and  there are no material hedging instruments related to the purchase of products from affiliates and third party suppliers 
our financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables and receivables 
interest rate risk we have earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on our outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are based on libor interest rates 
we have periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
since substantially all of our debt at august  was fixed rate  an increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates would have no impact on our interest costs 
commodity risk we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
we strive to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lead initiatives to further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
see also currency risk above 
we did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august  or to hedge exposure to commodity risk
