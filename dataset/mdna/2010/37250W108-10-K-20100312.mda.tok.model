item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and related notes in item of this annual report 
backlog includes our sla with the nga  access fee agreements with our international regional affiliates  regional affiliate ground station operations and maintenance contracts  commercial imagery contracts and value added products and services 
our backlog as of december   included approximately million of contracts with the us government  including approximately million related specifically to the sla 
in addition to this backlog  we have recently added another million with our most recent sla extension 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis  however  certain international government and commercial customers have signed multi year contracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in backlog 
in addition  there is million of remaining unamortized revenue related to payments made prior to foc from nga  of which million is expected to be recognized during we have not included this in our backlog because no specific services will be rendered to recognize the revenue 
the balance will be recognized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the satellite 
company history geoeye was initially organized as orbimage holdings  inc  delaware corporation  on april  it was formed to enable its predecessor registrant  and subsequently its wholly owned subsidiary  orbimage inc  a delaware corporation  to implement a holding company organizational structure 
orbimage inc was established on december  in conjunction with orbital imaging corporation s reorganization and emergence from chapter bankruptcy 
effective june   we reorganized into a holding company structure  by means of a merger conducted pursuant to section g of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the merger 
as a result of the merger  each stockholder of orbimage inc became a holder of the common stock of orbimage holdings inc  evidencing the same proportional interests  and orbimage inc became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of orbimage holdings inc accordingly  the company became the successor registrant of orbimage inc on january   we adopted the brand name geoeye 
on september   the stockholders of the company voted to formally change the legal name of the company from orbimage holdings  inc to geoeye  inc 
on september   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement purchase agreement to acquire the operating assets of space imaging 
on january   we completed the acquisition of space imaging si pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
the final cash purchase price  including acquisition costs  was approximately million 
the acquisition was financed mainly through the incurrence of million of indebtedness 
we were required to prepay the debt with of the excess cash flows of the acquired operations calculated on a quarterly basis 
we finished repaying the debt on february  on march   we acquired mj harden associates  inc mj harden through a stock purchase of all of the outstanding stock of mj harden s sole owner  i  inc mj harden is a leading provider of digital aerial imagery and geospatial information solutions 
in december  we established a new foreign subsidiary in singapore to service our expanding asia customer base  geoeye asia pte 
ltd 
in january  we changed the names of the company s subsidiaries as follows old name new name orbimage inc geoeye imagery collection systems inc orbimage si holdco inc geoeye solutions holdco inc orbimage si opco inc geoeye solutions inc orbimage license corporation geoeye license corporation competition we compete against various public and private companies  as well as systems owned by the us government and foreign state sponsored entities that provide satellite and aerial imagery products and services to the commercial market 
our major competitor for high resolution satellite imagery is digitalglobe  inc digitalglobe  a publicly listed commercial vendor of space imagery 
international competitors for high resolution satellite imagery and imagery products include the national remote sensing agency  department of space government of india  radarsat international canada  imagesat international nv israel  spot image sa france  taiwan and korea 
for risks associated with competition  see item a 
risk factors 
employees at december   we had employees 
generally  our employees are retained on an at will basis 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key employees 
certain of our employees have non competition agreements that prohibit them from competing with us for various periods following termination of their employment 
government regulation the satellite remote imaging industry is a highly regulated industry  both domestically and internationally 
in the us  the operation of remote imaging satellites generally requires licenses from the department of commerce doc and from the federal communications commission fcc 
furthermore  remote sensing satellite and ground control station technologies are subject to us export control licensing and regulation under the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the department of state and the export administration regulations ear administered by the doc 
in addition  we are party to certain classified us government contracts  the performance of which is subject to us facility and personnel clearance laws and regulations 
as is the case with any us business  we are subject to us government foreign corrupt practices act restrictions regarding conducting business with foreign government officials and us treasury department restrictions prohibiting conducting business with certain embargoed countries or entities or persons on the specifically designated nationals list maintained by the us treasury department 
finally  in order to provide satellite access services and imagery products internationally  our satellites may require international telecommunications union itu notification and registration and licenses from the governments of foreign countries where our services and products will be distributed 
united states department of commerce regulation the doc  through the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  is responsible for granting commercial imaging satellite operating licenses and for coordinating satellite imaging applications among several governmental agencies to ensure that any license addresses all us national security and foreign policy concerns  and complies with all international obligations of the united states 
we are required to obtain a doc license to operate each of our remote sensing satellite systems and provide imagery services to our customers 
we currently have doc licenses for all of our existing satellite systems 
we also hold a doc license that we intend to use for the geoeye satellite system that is being developed 
we intend to modify this doc license  subject to doc approval  to reflect the final technical specifications for the geoeye satellite if we are awarded an agreement to build the geoeye satellite under the nga s enhancedview program 
the doc license for geoeye is a constellation license and authorizes us to operate an additional satellite subject to doc approval 
the doc licenses for our satellites are valid through the operational lifetime of each satellite 
we expect to satisfy the terms of each of the doc licenses for our satellites and to maintain the regulatory licenses and approvals necessary for their ongoing operations 
our doc licenses generally include the following key operating conditions we are required to maintain positive operational control of our satellite systems from a location within the united states at all times  we are restricted from disseminating to anyone other than the us government panchromatic imagery with a resolution better than meters or multispectral imagery with a resolution better than meters  the us government reserves the right to exercise shutter control the interruption of service by limiting imagery collection and or distribution as necessary to meet significant us government national security or foreign policy interests or international obligations 
although the us government has never exercised shutter control with respect to our satellite systems  the exercise of this authority would require us to make imagery data available exclusively to the us government by means of approved re keyable encryption on the downlink 
we cannot anticipate whether or under what circumstances the us government would exercise its shutter control authority  nor can we reasonably determine what costs and terms would be negotiated between us and the us government in such event  we are required to obtain doc approval before implementing significant or substantial agreements with foreign nations  entities or consortiums foreign persons in order to protect the national security and foreign policy interests and international obligations of the us government 
transfers of significant or substantial agreements also require doc approval 
examples of significant or substantial agreements include customer agreements for high resolution imagery collection and distribution  operating agreements and agreements relating to equity investments in the company of or more of the total outstanding shares or that entitle a foreign person to a position on our board of directors 
foreign persons entering significant or substantial agreements with us are required to comply with our doc license imagery collection and distribution restrictions and are subject to the us government s exercise of shutter control  which could adversely affect our ability to collect imagery products for distribution to our foreign customers  and we are restricted from disseminating imagery of the state of israel with a resolution better than meters 
fcc regulation the fcc is responsible for licensing commercial satellite and ground systems and the radio frequencies used by commercial satellite systems 
in general  the fcc grants licenses to commercial satellite systems that conform to the technical  legal and financial requirements for these systems set forth in fcc regulations 
below is a table summarizing the fcc license grant and expiration dates for the operation of our current satellites and related ground systems geoeye ikonos orbview fcc satellite license grant date commercially operational yes yes yes fcc satellite license expiration date october  renewable for or more years subject to fcc approval grant date of associated fcc ground station licenses expiration date of associated fcc ground station license april   renewable for years subject to fcc approval december   october   and october   renewable for years subject to fcc approval october   renewable for or more years subject to fcc approval we also hold an fcc license to operate the orbview satellite  which remains in orbit but which ceased commercial operations in in the future  we will be required to obtain fcc licenses and approvals in connection with any new high resolution satellites that we plan to operate 
we expect that geoeye will operate in the same radio frequency bands as our geoeye and ikonos satellites and their associated ground systems or other frequency bands allocated for use by remote sensing satellite service providers  subject to fcc approval and that we will obtain the fcc licenses and approvals necessary for geoeye operations 
export controls and security clearance regulation we are subject to a complex set of export control and security clearance regulations for the products and services we offer 
among other things  we are a registrant under itar and we hold export licenses and other approvals from the us department of state s directorate of defense trade control ddtc for the export of hardware  software and technical data relating to the potential defense related satellites  ground stations  image processing facilities and support services provided to customers 
additional approvals may be required from ddtc and from the doc s bureau of industry and security in certain cases 
for example  export licenses may be required if certain foreign persons or entities are involved in the development or acquisition of our products and services 
also  the export of a geoeye supplied ground station or image processing facility to a foreign person would require a ddtc export approval 
the suspension or cancellation of our itar registration or ddtc approval to export our products and services would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  we require certain facility and personnel security clearances to perform our classified us government related business 
security clearances are subject to regulations and requirements including the national industrial security program operating manual  which provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information released or disclosed to industry in connection with classified us government contracts 
the suspension or cancellation of our facility clearances  or the inability to maintain personnel security clearances for our personnel to perform classified us government contracts  would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  any change in the ownership of geoeye involving a transfer to foreign persons or entities may increase us government scrutiny and lead to more onerous requirements in connection with both export controls and security clearances 
a transfer to foreign ownership could also trigger other requirements  including filings with and review by the committee on foreign investment in the united states pursuant to the exon florio provision and approval by noaa under our doc licenses 
depending on the country of origin and identity of foreign owners  other restrictions and requirements could arise 
future developments us regulators may subject us in the future to new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present us regulatory environment 
us regulators could decide to impose limitations on us companies that are currently applicable only to other countries  or other regulatory limitations that affect satellite remote imaging operations 
any limitations of this kind could adversely affect our business or our results of operations 
international all satellite systems providing services in the international markets must comply with the following general international regulations as well as the specific laws of the countries in which satellite imagery is downlinked or satellite imagery products are distributed 
international telecommunication union itu regulations itu regulations define for each service the technical operating parameters  including maximum transmitter power  maximum interference to other services and users and the minimum interference the user must operate under for that service 
the fcc  on our behalf  has completed the itu notification process for our ikonos  orbview and orbview satellite systems 
the itu received geoeye satellite system notification documents in june and we expect the itu to publish its findings recognizing completion of the geoeye itu notification within the next twelve months 
after completion of the itu notification process  ongoing coordination with other satellite systems could occur from time to time 
foreign downlink license the regulations of some foreign countries require satellite operators to secure appropriate licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum in each country 
within foreign countries  our foreign customers are responsible for securing appropriate licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum for downlinking our high resolution satellite imagery with assistance from us as required 
foreign imagery acquisition or distribution regulations the regulations or policies of foreign countries may restrict the acquisition or distribution of satellite imagery products and services 
for example  in the republic of india  we obtained permission from the government to promote satellite imagery product sales to customers in india  provided the actual product deliveries are made through a government appointed reseller 
while we believe we will be able to obtain all us  itu and foreign government licenses  authorizations and registrations necessary to provide services internationally  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
the failure to obtain some or all necessary licenses  approvals or registrations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors the risks described below  among others  could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward looking statements made in this form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
a substantial portion of our revenues are generated from contracts with us government agencies 
termination of these contracts at any given time could materially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 
revenues from us government contracts accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  us government agencies may terminate or suspend their contracts at any time  with or without cause  or may change their policies  priorities or funding levels by reducing agency or program budgets due to budgetary constraints 
our primary contract with the us government  through the nga  is the nextview imagery contract 
on march   the us government signed a modification to the sla to provide the option to extend this contract through june   followed by six additional one month option periods  with the last option period expiring on december  although we anticipate the nga will award a new contract to us on or around june   there can be no assurances that either such event will occur or that the us government will continue to purchase imagery from us at its current level  if at all 
if the nga terminates or suspends any of its contracts with us  or changes its policies  priorities  or funding levels  these actions would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sla provides for monthly payments of up to million  subject to a maximum reduction of based on performance metrics 
we recognized million of revenue under the sla for the year ended december   which accounted for approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  changes in us government policy regarding the use of commercial imagery products and service providers  or material delay or cancellation of the planned us government enhancedview program may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to fund operations and achieve our growth objectives 
current us government policy encourages the use of commercial imagery products and services to support us national security objectives 
we are considered by the us government to be such a provider 
us government policy is subject to change and any change in policy away from supporting the use of commercial imagery products and service providers to meet us government imagery needs could materially affect our revenue and our ability to fund operations and achieve our growth objectives 
enhancedview is a large us government procurement that is intended to serve as the follow on program to the nextview program  in which we currently participate 
our revenue under the nextview program accounted for of our total revenue in the enhancedview procurement is in the proposal stage 
satellites have limited useful lives and are expensive to replace 
satellites have limited useful lives 
we determine a satellite s useful life  or its expected operational life  using a complex calculation involving the probabilities of failure of the satellite s components from design or manufacturing defects  environmental stresses  estimated remaining fuel or other causes 
the expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of construction  the supply of fuel  the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels  the durability of various satellite components and the orbits in which the satellites are placed 
certain advanced components  such as its cameras  are integral to a satellite s design functionality and expected operational life 
the failure of satellite components can cause damage to  or loss of  the use of a satellite before the end of its expected operational life 
electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects could damage our satellites which could  in turn  impair their design functionality 
such objects could include debris from exploded satellites and spent rocket stages  dead satellites and meteoroids 
we cannot assure you that each satellite will remain in operation for its expected operational life 
we expect the performance of any satellite to decline gradually near the end of its expected operational life 
our geoeye satellite was launched in september and has an expected operational life of nine years 
ikonos  another of our satellites  was fully depreciated in june we currently expect to continue commercial operations with ikonos through based on a study that was completed in august of and updated in january by the ikonos manufacturer  which resulted in a revised life expectancy for ikonos 
however  there can be no assurance that ikonos will continue to operate adequately to remain commercially viable 
during the last year  our orbview satellite has on several occasions experienced operational anomalies related to various components 
when these have occurred  orbview has switched into safe hold mode in order to protect itself while our ground operations personnel worked to restore its functionality  which has historically taken two weeks to several months 
when in safe hold mode  orbview is unable to provide imagery 
the satellite recently returned to normal operations and we continue to monitor the situation 
management is currently doing a cost benefits analysis of continuing orbview operations  since we can obtain the information it provides from other external sources 
replacing a satellite is expensive 
we anticipate using funds generated from operations to develop and launch future high resolution imagery satellites 
if we do not generate sufficient funds from operations or we cannot obtain financing from outside sources  we will not be able to deploy new satellites to replace geoeye at the end of its expected operational life 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from operations or to raise additional capital on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all  to develop or deploy follow on high resolution satellites 
we cannot assure you that our satellites will operate as designed 
we may experience in orbit satellite failures or degradations in performance that could impair the commercial performance of our satellites  which could lead to lost revenue  an increase in our operating expenses  lower operating income or lost backlog 
our satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are subject to severe environmental stresses in space that could affect the satellite s performance 
hardware component problems in space could lead to degradation in performance or loss of functionality of the satellite  with attendant costs and revenue losses 
in addition  human operators may execute improper implementation commands that negatively impact a satellite s performance 
unanticipated catastrophic events  such as meteor showers or collisions with space debris  could reduce the performance of or completely destroy any of our satellites 
even if a satellite is operated properly  minor technical flaws in the satellite s sensors could significantly degrade their performance  which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products successfully 
our business model depends on our ability to sell imagery from our high resolution satellites 
we do not presently have plans to construct and launch a replacement satellite for ikonos or orbview if either fails 
during the last year orbview has on several occasions experienced operational anomalies related to various components 
when these have occurred  orbview has switched into safe hold mode in order to protect itself while our ground operations personnel work to restore its functionality  which has historically taken two weeks to several months 
when in safe hold mode  orbview is unable to provide imagery 
in september  orbview switched into safe hold mode and has been unable to provide imagery on a regular basis 
the satellite recently returned to normal operations and we continue to monitor the situation 
while we have historically had success in returning orbview to operational status from this mode  we cannot assure you that orb view will continue to operate normally or will return to operational status should it re enter the safe hold mode 
we are developing the geoeye satellite program  which will likely take approximately three to four years to complete 
accordingly  geoeye cannot be considered a near term replacement if the geoeye satellite were to fail 
in december  we announced that our engineers detected an irregularity in the equipment that geoeye uses to point the antenna that transmits imagery to receiving stations on the ground 
this irregularity appears to limit the range of movement of geoeye s downlink antenna  which affects geoeye s ability to image and downlink simultaneously to a few of our international customers that have contracted for that service 
geoeye is still able to downlink imagery to geoeye s four ground stations  since down linking to these ground stations is separate from imaging activities  however  as of the date of this filing  the irregularity has not yet been remedied and we cannot assure you that this irregularity will ever be fully remediated 
in may  we announced that we had identified an issue with a particular color imagery collection feature of geoeye while we have subsequently modified our operations mode to mitigate the risk associated with this imagery collection issue and believe that this was an isolated occurrence  we cannot assure you that our cameras will not experience similar issues in the future  which could have a material adverse affect on our collection capacity 
any other failure of our satellites or any interference with such satellites commercial operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business 
new or proposed satellites are subject to construction and launch delays  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations 
we have in the past experienced delays in satellite construction and launch which have adversely affected our operations 
such delays can result from delays in the construction of satellites  procurement of requisite components  launch vehicles  the limited availability of appropriate launch windows  possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures 
failure to meet a satellite s construction schedule  resulting in a significant delay in the future delivery of a satellite could also adversely affect our marketing strategy for the satellite 
even after a satellite has been manufactured and is ready for launch  an appropriate launch date may not be available for several months 
further  any significant delay in the commencement of service of any of our satellites would allow customers who pre purchased or agreed to utilize capacity on the satellite to terminate their contracts and could affect our plans to replace an in orbit satellite prior to the end of its service life 
we operate in a highly competitive and specialized industry 
the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can  which could result in loss of our market share 
our products and services compete with satellite and aircraft based imagery and related products and services offered by a range of commercial and government providers 
certain of these competitors may have greater financial  personnel and other resources than us 
our major us competitor for high resolution satellite imagery is digitalglobe 
digitalglobe currently operates three high resolution satellites  quickbird  launched in  worldview  launched in september  and worldview satellite  launched on october  we believe that worldview has the ability to provide commercial customers with meter resolution imagery 
in addition  worldview has the ability to collect color imagery  which could strengthen digitalglobe s position in the industry 
our satellites have different capabilities from those of digitalglobe 
in particular  all of our satellites have the ability to produce color imagery  while only two of digitalglobe s satellites can image in color and geoeye s image resolution of meters is believed to be the highest resolution of any commercial satellite 
historically  we have enjoyed a competitive advantage over digitalglobe in the international markets because our high resolution satellites have had the capability to directly download imagery to our customers ground stations 
however  the worldview and worldview satellites may now have some of the same capabilities 
additionally  both the worldview and worldview satellites have higher resolutions and more advanced technologies than our ikonos satellite 
it is possible that foreign governments could subsidize  fund the development  construct  launch and operate imagery satellites with higher resolution and accuracy in the future  which could enable them to sell earth imagery from their satellites in the commercial market and thereby compete on price with our imagery products 
if competitors develop and launch satellites with more advanced technologies than ours  or offer services at lower prices than ours  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
if we cannot maintain our margins  our financial position could be impacted and our stock price could decline 
us and foreign governmental agencies may build and operate their own systems which could affect the current and potential market share of our products and services 
the us government currently relies and is likely to continue to rely on government owned and operated systems for classified satellite based high resolution imagery 
the us government could reduce its purchases from commercial satellite imagery providers or decrease the number of companies to which it contracts with no corresponding increase in the total amount spent 
the us government and foreign governments also may develop  construct  launch and operate their own imagery satellites  which could reduce their need to rely on commercial suppliers 
in addition  such governments could sell earth imagery from their satellites in the commercial market and thereby compete with our imagery products and services 
these governments could also subsidize the development  launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors 
any reduction in purchases of our products and services by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of operations 
the success of our products and services will depend on market acceptance  and you should not rely on historic growth rates as an indicator of future growth 
our success depends on existing markets accepting our imagery products and services and our ability to develop new markets 
our business plan is based on the assumption that we will generate significant future revenues from sales of high resolution imagery produced by geoeye and ikonos to current and new customers in our existing markets and to customers in new markets 
the commercial availability of high resolution satellite imagery is still a fairly new market 
consequently  it is difficult to predict accurately the ultimate size of the market and the market acceptance of our products and services 
our strategy to target certain markets for our satellite imagery relies on a number of assumptions  some or all of which may be incorrect 
the actual market for our products and services could vary materially from the potential markets that we have identified causing us to target less promising markets and miss opportunities 
we cannot accurately predict whether our products and services will achieve significant market acceptance or whether there will be a market for our products and services on terms we find acceptable 
market acceptance of our commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services depends on a number of factors  including the quality  scope  timeliness  sophistication and price and services and the availability of substitute products and services 
lack of significant market acceptance of our offerings  or other products and services that utilize our products and services  delays in acceptance  failure of certain markets to develop or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market would negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not continue to grow in line with historical rates  or at all 
if we are unable to achieve sustained growth  we may be unable to execute our business strategy  expand our business or fund our liquidity needs and our prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
interruption or failure of our infrastructure and image downloading systems could impair our ability to effectively perform our daily operations  protect and maintain the earth imagery content stored in our image archives and provide our products and services  which could damage our reputation and harm our results of operations 
the availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our infrastructure  information technology and communications systems 
any system downtime or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service  which could reduce our revenue and profits 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems 
our data centers and ground stations have the ability to be powered by backup generators 
however  if our primary source of power and the backup generators fail  our daily operations and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  our ground stations and collection systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  intentional bad acts  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  fires  war  terrorist attacks  power losses  hardware failures  systems failures  telecommunications failures and similar events 
our satellite imagery is downloaded directly to our ground stations and then stored in our image archives for sale to our customers 
as a result  our operations are dependent upon our ability to maintain and protect our earth imagery content and our image archives and to provide our images to our customers  including our foreign distribution network and value added resellers 
the impairment of our ability to perform any of these functions could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and or damage our reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations 
we rely on resellers and a foreign distribution network to market and sell our products and services in certain markets and to certain customers 
if these distributors and resellers fail to market our products and services successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we rely principally on foreign regional distributors to market and sell our imagery from the geoeye and ikonos satellites internationally 
we are currently intensifying our efforts to further develop our current and future operations in international markets 
these regional distributors may not have the skill or experience to further develop regional commercial markets for our products and services 
if we fail to enter into additional regional distribution agreements or if our foreign regional distributors fail to market and sell our imagery products and services abroad successfully  these failures could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on resellers to develop  market and sell our products and services to address certain target markets  including certain industries and geographical markets 
if our value added resellers fail to develop  market and sell our products and services successfully  this failure could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance coverage may be more difficult and costly to obtain or maintain 
in october  the company issued million of senior secured notes due october  notes 
the terms of the notes require us to obtain launch and in orbit insurance for any future satellites we construct and launch and also requires us to maintain specified levels of in orbit operation insurance for geoeye  to the extent that such coverage can be obtained at a premium that is not disproportionately high 
with respect to geoeye  we currently carry million of in orbit insurance  consisting of million of in orbit insurance in the event of the total loss of the satellite expiring december   plus million of in orbit coverage to be paid if the satellite s capabilities become impaired as measured against a set of specifications  of which million expires on september   million expires on december  and million expires on september  we believe that under current market conditions the premiums for additional coverage would be disproportionately high 
this insurance is not sufficient to cover the cost of a replacement high resolution imagery satellite such as geoeye or to provide us with sufficient funds to repurchase all of the notes then outstanding in the event that  as a result of such a loss  we are required to make a mandatory offer to repurchase the notes 
with respect to ikonos  we currently carry million of in orbit coverage to be paid if the satellite s capabilities become impaired as measured against a set of specifications  expiring december  we do not carry any insurance coverage for the orbview satellite 
accordingly  our current levels of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fund operations in the event loss proceeds are required for the repurchase of our notes 
insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at a time when we would seek required insurance  such as failure of a satellite using similar components or a similar launch vehicle  could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates 
higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs 
should the future terms of launch and in orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available  this may result in limits on amounts of coverage that we can obtain or may prevent us from obtaining insurance at all 
any failure to obtain required insurance could cause a default under the notes 
a partial or complete failure of a revenue producing satellite  whether insured or not  could require additional  unplanned capital expenditures  an acceleration of planned capital expenditures  interruptions in service  a reduction in contracted backlog and lost revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the global financial crisis may impact our business  financial condition and results of operations in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continuing credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business  our financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the cost of capital has increased substantially while the availability of funds from the capital markets has diminished significantly 
accordingly  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted or be available only on terms we do not consider favorable 
limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our strategy 
the current economic situation could have an impact on our customers  causing them to fail to meet obligations to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results from operations and cash flows 
state and local governments may be more vulnerable to the economic downturn and  accordingly  our mj harden operations have and could continue to face greater exposure to this risk 
for example  our revenue from production and other services decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  which we believe was partially due to a decrease in state and local funding for imaging products from our digital aerial imagery services as a result of the economic downturn 
a continued economic downturn coupled with the uncertainty and volatility of the global financial crisis may have further adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows that we currently cannot predict or anticipate 
in addition  the current economic downturn has also led to concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the financial strength of our counterparties 
for example  if one or more of our insurance carriers fails  we may not receive the full amount of proceeds due to us in the event of loss or damage to one of our satellites 
in addition  if we attempt to obtain future insurance in addition to  or replacement of  our existing coverage  the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such insurance 
our business is capital intensive  and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies  including any future satellite  or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business 
the implementation of our business strategies requires a substantial outlay of capital 
as we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry  our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future 
we currently expect that our operational liquidity requirements in will be satisfied by cash on hand  cash generated from our operations and the net proceeds from the notes offering 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to execute our business strategies 
lending institutions have suffered and may continue to suffer losses due to their lending and other financial relationships  especially because of the general weakening of the global economy 
as a result  changes in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain new financing or refinance our existing debt on commercially reasonable terms and in adequate amounts  if at all 
if we determine we need to obtain additional funds through external financing and are unable to do so  we may be prevented from fully implementing our business strategies 
in particular  if we determine to construct and launch a next generation satellite  we may require significant capital  and the timing of the construction will depend on our ability to raise the necessary capital on terms which we deem to be acceptable 
we expect to continue to make reasonable investments in geoeye s development  but we do not expect to launch or commission the geoeye satellite on an accelerated basis without an agreement with the nga under its enhancedview program 
therefore  we would most likely proceed so that a next generation satellite could be used as a replacement satellite for geoeye in the to timeframe  which may nonetheless require additional capital 
regardless of our desired delivery schedule  if any  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to allow for the construction of a next generation satellite 
failure to obtain  or the revocation or suspension of  regulatory approvals could result in service interruptions and materially adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
us government approvals 
operation of our satellites requires licenses from the doc 
the failure to obtain these licenses  or the revocation of one or more licenses  could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
the doc licenses provide that the us government may interrupt service or otherwise limit our ability to distribute satellite images to certain parties  including certain of our customers  in order to address national security or foreign policy concerns or because of the international obligations of the us actual or threatened interruptions or limitations on our service could adversely affect our ability to market our products 
in addition  the doc has the right to review and approve our agreements with foreign entities  including contracts with international customers for high resolution imagery 
we have received such approvals for the agreements in place with our existing international customers 
however  such reviews could delay or prohibit us from executing new international agreements or renewals or extensions of our existing agreements  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have in the past and may in the future supply certain of our international customers with access to ground stations that enable these customers to downlink data directly from our satellites 
exporting these ground stations and technical information relating to these stations may require us to obtain export licenses from the doc or the us department of state 
if the doc or the us department of state does not issue these export licenses in connection with future exports  or if these licenses are significantly delayed or contain restrictions  or if the doc or the us department of state revokes  suspends or denies a request for renewal of existing licenses  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our operation of satellites and ground stations also requires licenses from the fcc 
the fcc regulates the construction  launch and operation of our satellites  the use of satellite spectrum and the licensing of our ground stations terminals located within the united states 
we currently have all required fcc licenses necessary to operate our business as it is currently conducted 
however  these licenses have expiration dates which are expected to occur while the satellites and ground systems are still in use 
the fcc generally renews licenses routinely  but there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates for full terms or without adverse conditions 
failure to renew these licenses or obtain fcc authorization to construct  launch and operate any new satellites could have a material adverse affect on our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business as currently planned 
international registration and approvals 
the use of satellite spectrum is subject to the requirements of the itu 
additionally  satellite operators must abide by the specific laws of the countries in which downlink services are provided from the satellite to ground station terminals within such countries 
our customers or distributors are responsible for obtaining local regulatory approval from the governments in the countries in which they receive imagery downlinked directly from our satellites to ground stations within such countries 
if the necessary approvals are not obtained  we will not be able to distribute real time imagery in those regions and this inability to offer real time service in a foreign country could negatively affect our business 
in addition  regulatory provisions in countries where we wish to operate may impose unduly burdensome restrictions on our operations 
our business may also be adversely affected if the national authorities where we plan to operate adopt treaties  regulations or legislation unfavorable to foreign companies or limiting the provision of our products and services 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
with respect to the material weakness  our management concluded that we did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy and valuation of the provision for income taxes 
see item a 
controls and procedures 
until the material weakness is fully remediated  this material weakness could lead to errors in our reported financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
notwithstanding our remediation efforts  the material weakness described above will not be remediated until the new controls operate for a sufficient period of time and are tested to enable management to conclude that the controls are effective 
our management will consider the design and operating effectiveness of these controls and will make any additional changes management determines appropriate 
further  we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional material weaknesses and cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated under section the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
our international business exposes us to risks relating to increased regulation and political or economic instability in foreign markets 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues were derived from international sales 
we intend to continue to pursue international contracts and we expect to continue to derive substantial revenues from international sales of our products and services 
international operations are subject to certain risks  such as changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements  deterioration of relations between the united states and a particular foreign country  increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers  changes in political and economic stability  including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  which may make payment in us dollars  as provided for under our existing contracts  more expensive for foreign customers  and difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends upon a limited number of key personnel 
our success depends on attracting  retaining and motivating highly skilled professionals 
a number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other professionals 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the members of our senior management 
competition for highly skilled individuals is intense  and if we fail to continue to attract  retain and motivate such professionals  our ability to compete in our industry could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including  without limitation risks and uncertainties affecting our current and proposed business and the imagery derived products and processing service satellite industry  increased competition in the industry  and general economic conditions 
as a result of these possible fluctuations  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be reliable indicators of future performance 
the price of our common stock has been volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies in the technology sector 
in particular  over the last twelve months  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for small companies and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance or prospects for future operations 
these broad fluctuations may adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
future market movements may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the company has agreed to issue to cerberus capital management l 
p  subject to certain conditions  up to million of convertible preferred stock of the company which could adversely impact the price of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently expect to retain our future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we are prohibited from paying dividends under instruments governing our notes until the principal amount of all the notes has been repaid 
we have substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   after giving effect to the offering of the notes  we have million of long term debt in the aggregate  consisting of the notes and million of the outstanding notes which remain outstanding 
the million of notes were repaid in full on january  we also hold a commitment from cerberus capital management l 
p 
to purchase up to million of senior unsecured notes if the company so elects  with the notes maturing in our substantial indebtedness has important consequences 
for example  it limits our ability to borrow additional funds  limits our ability to pay dividends  limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limits our ability to make strategic acquisitions  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness  reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  and places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 
interest costs related to our debt are substantial and  as a result  the demands on our cash resources are significant 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund operations and planned capital expenditures will depend on our future results of operations and ability to generate cash 
our future results of operations are  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
servicing our indebtedness will require significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
for the year ended december   our interest expense was million  compared to million for the year ended december  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if our cash flows are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness  we may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  or that we will be able to refinance on commercially reasonable terms or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  the value of our outstanding debt including the notes and our ability to make any required cash payments under our indebtedness 
government audits of our contracts could result in a material charge to our earnings and have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment 
our government contracts are subject to cost audits which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates 
if an audit identifies significant unallowable costs  we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position 
our effective income tax rate may vary 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes 
all of these factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate

risk factors  which describes key risks associated with our operations and industry 
overview geoeye is a leading commercial provider of highest accuracy and highest resolution earth imagery  image processing services and imagery information products to us and foreign government defense and intelligence organizations  domestic federal and foreign civil agencies  and commercial customers 
we own and operate three earth imaging satellites  geoeye  ikonos and orbview and three fixed wing aircraft with advanced high resolution imagery collection capabilities 
geoeye is the world s highest resolution and most accurate commercial imaging satellite 
in addition to our imagery collection capacities  we are a global leader in the creation of enhanced satellite imagery information products and services 
we operate four high resolution image processing and production facilities which can process  manage  analyze and share imagery from any commercial or government satellite 
our satellite and aerial imagery products and services provide our customers with the timely  and accurate location intelligence  enabling them to analyze  monitor and map to their needs and demands 
we serve a growing global market that requires high resolution imagery and precision mapping products for applications such as national defense and intelligence  online mapping  environmental monitoring and resource management  energy exploration  asset monitoring  urban planning  infrastructure planning and monitoring  and disaster preparedness and emergency response 
we own one of the largest commercial color digital satellite imagery libraries in the world  which contains more than million square kilometers of color imagery of the earth 
we believe the combination of our highly accurate satellite and aerial imaging assets  our high resolution image processing and production facilities  and our color digital imagery library differentiates us from our competitors 
this enables us to deliver a comprehensive range of imaging products and services to our diverse customer base 
impact of significant transactions geoeye satellite  nextview program and service level agreement the us government s nga  announced in march that it intended to support  through the nextview program  the continued development of the commercial satellite imagery industry 
the nga also announced that it intended to award two imagery providers with contracts to support the engineering  construction and launch of the next generation of imagery satellites 
on september   the nga awarded us a contract as the second provider under the nextview program and  as a result  we contracted for the construction of a new satellite  geoeye under the nextview program  we began delivering imagery to nga from our ikonos satellite in february and from our geoeye satellite in the first quarter of geoeye was launched in september and started commercial operations and obtained certification from the nga in february  at which point the satellite commenced full operations 
geoeye is currently the world s highest resolution and highest accuracy commercial imagery satellite and offers both black and white and color imagery 
the geoeye satellite was constructed as part of our participation in the nextview program 
we achieved deployment of geoeye for less than the maximum cost specified in our nextview contract with the nga 
total final capitalized costs including financing and launch insurance costs of the geoeye satellite and related ground systems were million 
under the nextview contract  the nga agreed to support the project with a cost share totaling approximately million spread over the course of the project development and subject to various milestones 
on march   the nga paid us the final installment of its cost share obligation 
we recognize this as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected nine year operational life of the satellite 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of deferred revenue under the nextview contract 
on december   we entered into a sla  with the nga under which the nga agreed to purchase geoeye imagery from us through november  the sla provides for monthly payments of million  subject to a maximum reduction of based on performance metrics 
under the sla  to the extent that less than million is paid by nga in any month  the shortfall is used to fund an extension of the contract 
on september   the nga extended the sla through march  in addition  the nga  on march   modified the sla giving it the option to extend the term of the sla beyond march  the sla has been extended through june   followed by six additional one month option periods 
the last option period expires on december  during the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue under the sla 
in addition to the sla modification to the nextview contract  we received new us government awards during the year ended december   totaling more than million to supply geospatial products and services 
under these awards  which are expected to be completed during  we will provide the nga with a significant amount of value added  imagery based geospatial intelligence products 
we began delivering imagery to the nga under the new awards in the first quarter of and recognized million of imagery revenue during the year ended december  in december  our engineers detected an irregularity in the equipment geoeye uses to point the antenna that transmits imagery to receiving stations on the ground 
the irregularity limits the range of movement of geoeye s downlink antenna  which affects geoeye s ability to image and downlink simultaneously 
geoeye is able to downlink imagery to geoeye s four ground stations  since down linking to these ground stations is separate from imaging activities 
as a result  we expect no impact on our on going ability to deliver imagery to the nga under the sla and to those of our regional affiliates for whom we collect and deliver imagery 
geoeye satellite we believe that demand for satellite imagery from the us government will increase beyond the available supply in the timeframe 
given the long lead time associated with providing additional capacity  we entered into a contract with itt corporation during the third quarter of pursuant to which itt has commenced work on the advanced camera for geoeye  which could be used to accelerate the deployment of geoeye so that it could be launched in late and commercially available in the timeframe 
as of december   we have spent a total of million on components of geoeye we view these expenditures as prudent and believe they will position us to move quickly should an opportunity arise to expand our existing nga relationship to a new satellite 
on march   the company announced the selection of lockheed martin space systems company to build the geoeye satellite 
we expect to continue to make reasonable investments in geoeye s development  but we do not expect to launch or commission the geoeye satellite on an accelerated basis without an agreement with the nga under its enhancedview program 
we are currently participating in the nga request for proposal contract process for the enhancedview program 
this program will allow our government to continue to receive a supply of unclassified  highly accurate satellite imagery from commercial satellite imagery providers and will replace the nextview program  which could expire in june  unless the nga exercises their option to extend it through december prior to launch and commissioning geoeye  we may require additional capital depending on the terms of our agreement  if any  with nga 
if we were not to build geoeye on an accelerated basis  we would most likely proceed so that a new high resolution satellite could be used as a replacement satellite for geoeye in the to timeframe 
business and industry factors business strategy with a broad range of imagery collection assets  world class image processing and production facilities  and a strong global distribution network  we are well positioned as a leading global provider of imagery and imagery information products 
key elements of our strategy to take advantage of our competitive position and grow our business include build on our existing  geographically diverse customer base 
we continue to build on our existing relationships with our customers and our international resellers so that we can offer value added products and services to meet their needs 
we remain committed to growing our geographically diverse customer base and driving growth through continued development of our relationships with international resellers and international ground stations 
continue to deliver quality and timely imagery 
our ability to provide high quality  accurate imagery to our customers in a timely manner is the foundation of our business 
we plan to continue to provide high quality imagery and production services to our customers through geoeye and to deploy capital into research and development to augment and enhance our ability to service our customers 
further expand our value added products and service offerings 
we believe our industry leading image resolution  our proprietary production process and expert personnel establish us as a leader in the field of image production and enhancement 
we have also recently expanded the production capacity of our facilities housing our classified and multi source production operations 
to support the growth of our aerial imagery operations  we purchased a third aircraft with an additional digital mapping camera that we placed into service in we believe these and continued investments in our image enhancement and production capabilities will enable us to serve the next generation demand for customer specific satellite imagery products and services 
further commercialize our industry leading high resolution imagery 
we have developed new platforms and distribution technologies to make our imagery and products more accessible to our current and potential customers 
we will seek to further commercialize our products and services to an increased variety of customers 
for example  with the successful launch in january of geofuse  our new web based suite of search and discovery tools  our customers are now able to browse our image catalog archives  and quickly and easily locate and preview imagery for their specific ends 
we believe geofuse and our investment in establishing similar content delivery platforms will enable us to make our products and services available to a larger number of customers 
industry factors the geospatial technologies industry is affected by many factors 
factors that drive market demand for our products and service include  but are not limited to  increased demand for technologies in response to national defense and environmental observation initiatives  commercial demand for satellite mapping technologies  infrastructure project initiatives and advances in communication technologies 
factors that could negatively impact market demand for our products and services include  but are not limited to  us and foreign governments launching their own imagery programs  the proliferation of competing surveillance technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles  us export constraints and decreasing defense budgets 
as with any industry there are trends  both positive and negative  that can have an impact on the commercial data providers 
positive trends include the following we expect that due to geopolitical uncertainty  global terrorist activity  a changing climate and large natural disasters  there will be continued demand from us and international government agencies for up to date and accurate digital mapping databases 
defense personnel may be called upon to deploy to support actions in hostile environments or respond to disasters  and combat mission planners will require the latest geospatial information 
countries will continue to need to monitor borders and the other areas of interest 
the frequency of natural disasters such as tsunamis  hurricanes and earthquakes has increased awareness of the utility of imagery information products for humanitarian missions and the need for geo information in risk assessment  response and recovery 
satellite data is a valuable tool in assessing disaster response and recovery and planning logistical operations 
commercial satellite imagery was once again put to immediate use following the january earthquake in haiti 
geoeye was the first to deliver commercial satellite imagery to the us government  foreign governments and commercial customers 
within twelve hours of the earthquake  imagery from the geoeye satellite was posted to the web 
the entire world saw the practical application of commercial satellite imagery for understanding the extent and scope of the damage in and around port au prince  haiti 
relief and government agencies used geoeye s satellite imagery to make better decisions about their relief and recover efforts 
additionally  in late february  geoeye provided imagery from both geoeye and ikonos to the us government after a magnitude earthquake struck chile 
commercial demand for geospatial technologies is growing 
according to an industry study  the commercial market for imagery better than three meter ground resolution from high resolution imaging satellites is expected to grow over the next few years 
we believe that growth will be fueled in part by the broad awareness created by the on line mapping search engines such as google earth tm and microsoft virtual earth tm 
consumers are beginning to utilize location based technologies for everything from navigation to social networking 
the convergence of imagery with gps and personal navigation devices  combined with inexpensive access to broad band communications networks  appears to have generated a development of new applications incorporating imagery and imagery information products 
our technology is well suited for infrastructure project management 
both satellite and aerial imagery  along with other location based technologies  can help the us achieve its infrastructure goals more efficiently and cost effectively since every infrastructure project has a reference to a physical location on the surface of the globe 
according to an industry trade group  a significant portion of the new stimulus programs proposed by the current us administration will require geospatial data or services  particularly in the areas of design and planning for infrastructure projects  wildfire mapping  environmental infrastructure projects  surveying and charting and improvements to airports 
we believe the heightened focus on the global environment could increase use of imagery for global observation to support climate change initiatives or to verify or monitor carbon reduction projects established through legislation or done voluntarily 
rapid advancements in it infrastructure capabilities such as cloud computing  mobile communications and broadband may have dramatic effects on the industry 
while digital information  including satellite imagery and products  is easily distributed to customers over the internet  there is increasing customer interest in having others host imagery for them while adding value to it in a service oriented environment 
as a result  we anticipate growth in the increasing use of cloud computing where data and applications reside in cyberspace rather than on company servers or hard drives 
the nga s sla is an example of how agencies may utilize geospatial technology rather than just buying imagery pixels by the square kilometer 
there are also some negative industry trends the us government may build and launch its own classified satellite imaging program and produce imagery similar to that currently provided by commercial data providers 
while the current and the last two administrations in the us developed commercial remote sensing policies that are favorable for the commercial satellite imagery industry  the intelligence community may make efforts to fund satellite systems that could compete with the commercial data providers 
the current economic demands on the us government resources and the inherent time it takes to design and deploy new imagery satellite systems may mitigate any near term impact should the government decide to develop competing assets 
however  we continue to monitor for any evolution in the us government s policy toward commercial imagery providers 
more countries are increasingly interested in building and launching their own imaging systems 
according to a noaa study in october  more than two dozen countries are or will be operating imaging satellites within the next few years 
while none of these imaging systems can currently match the resolution and accuracy of us commercial systems  several countries are planning to launch systems with capabilities similar to our imaging assets 
the development and launch of such systems does involve significant risk and uncertainty  including technological  launch and financing risk 
we are mindful of this trend as we consider how best to grow our business 
the us government is increasingly using other sensors such as unmanned aerial vehicles for more persistent surveillance 
while these systems are mainly used for tactical intelligence collection  they provide commanders with visibility over an area of interest on a more sustained basis 
we believe that our imagery and products will remain an important element in fulfilling the us government s broad imagery needs in both tactical and non mission critical situations 
while not new  the us government continues to place onerous restrictions on the export of space components to all countries 
itar created a decade ago to ensure us space technology does not fall in the wrong hands  has  in effect  hampered us competitiveness overseas 
such strict government licensing restricts exchange of technical data and export of commercial remote sensing hardware  such as ground stations  thereby encouraging development of foreign manufacturing capability 
because of itar  us sales of earth observation satellite systems overseas is virtually non existent 
we are mindful of overall market trends and the pressure on defense and intelligence budgets 
while our satellite imagery business is somewhat insulated from the general economic downturn because we provide crucial information to defense and intelligence agencies around the world  economic conditions at the state and local level could affect mj harden  and it may be harder to penetrate new markets  especially on the commercial side

the totals shown above may not appear to sum due to rounding 
revenues for the year ended december  change between and revenues amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands  except percentages imagery nextview cost share production and other services total revenues imagery revenues increased million primarily due to the substantial increase in levels of deliveries to nga using the geoeye satellite under the new sla agreement which commenced in february during the fourth quarter of  we recorded reductions of revenue of million as a result of the geoeye satellite irregularity and contract modifications 
nextview cost share revenues of million are related to the recognition of deferred revenue from cost share amounts received from nga and recognized over the useful life of the satellite 
production and other services revenues decreased by a net million in compared to primarily due to a million revenue decrease in the combination of our digital aerial imagery service and the seastar fisheries information service  both of which have been negatively affected by the economic downturn resulting in lower sales volumes 
this revenue decline was partially offset by a million increase in our us government and commercial based value added production services

subcontractor costs increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in operational and maintenance costs to support the geoeye satellite during other direct costs include third party costs and fees to support our satellite programs as well as payments to international regional affiliates to purchase ikonos imagery collected by them in their exclusive regions and which we resell to our customers 
other direct costs decreased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of the sale of ground station upgrades of million in that did not occur in as well as our decreased need to purchase ikonos imagery from our regional affiliates for resale to other customers by million  offset by a million increase in related to the recognition of the costs of the ground systems upgrades that are being recognized over the combined delivery term of the service 
labor and overhead costs increased million compared to the same period in primarily due to increased labor and overhead related to the operation of the geoeye satellite  which became operational in the first quarter of satellite insurance increased million compared to the same period in due to the commencement of amortization of in orbit insurance premiums for the geoeye satellite which began operations in february depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  change between and depreciation and amortization amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands  except percentages depreciation amortization total depreciation and amortization the increase of million in depreciation in from was primarily due to the commencement of geoeye satellite operations in february  when we began depreciating the geoeye satellite and the related ground systems

payroll  commissions  and related costs increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in headcount  commissions  and the annual performance bonus and stock compensation expense as a result of growth of our operations 
the increase in professional fees of million compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to fees for accounting and tax services and related internal control remediation efforts as well as for bid and proposal efforts related to new business development mainly for the enhancedview program 
research and development expenses primarily include the cost of services and supplies in the development of the new information services business 
inventory impairment and satellite impairment settlement during  we determined that million of certain inventory costs related to a terminated customer contract should be written off 
we had a post launch on orbit milestone payment obligation with orbital sciences in connection with the ongoing performance of orbview that was written off in the first quarter of in conjunction with the loss of orbview the obligation was subsequently settled and million was paid in april interest expense  net the composition of interest expense  net is as follows for the year ended december  change between and interest expense  net amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands  except percentages interest expense capitalized interest interest income total interest expense  net interest expense  net includes interest expense on our notes and notes  amortized prepaid financing costs  amortization of debt discount  market adjustments to fair value of the related derivative instruments and excludes capitalized interest expense associated with the construction of the satellites and related ground systems as well as interest income 
interest expense  net increased primarily due to the decrease in capitalization of interest of million as a result of the commencement of the geoeye satellite operations in february offset by the million decrease related to losses recorded on the derivative instruments in and not incurred in due to the issuance of the notes in the fourth quarter of  we were able to lower our cost of capital by reducing our interest rate from a floating rate of at least to a fixed coupon rate of 
interest expense related to the notes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense related to the notes was million for the year ended december  in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in june pursuant to which the effective interest rate under the notes was fixed at through july  in february  we entered into a million interest rate cap agreement that intended to protect us from increases in interest rates by limiting our interest rate exposure to the three month libor with a cap of 
the cap option cost was million and was effective july  through january  as of december  the fair value of the interest rate cap was zero 
interest income decreased by million in primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower average interest rates on cash balances during as compared with other non operating expense during the fourth quarter of we impaired a cost method investment in the amount of million 
loss from early extinguishment of debt the loss from early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was million  due to the issuance of the notes with a face value of million in october and repayment of million of our notes 
the early extinguishment of debt represents the expensing of the unamortized prepaid financing costs  unamortized discount and tender premium related to the notes 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million for and  respectively 
tax provisions were calculated using our estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately and for and  respectively  prior to the application of discrete items 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits for and was million and million  respectively 
during  we paid certain items that were reserved  removed certain items for which we have received waivers from related jurisdictions and removed those items settled as a result of filing our income tax returns and related method changes 
we recorded additional reserves related to income tax penalties and interest for state taxes and research and development credits 
on october   the internal revenue service approved our ruling request regarding an ownership change to effectively allow us to recover million of previously limited net operating loss generated prior to november we plan to amend prior year income tax returns resulting in a tax receivable of approximately million and the remaining million carryforward balance has been recorded as an million deferred tax asset 
the utilization of the deferred tax asset related to the restored net operating loss carryforward is limited to approximately million per year as part of a section ownership change 
additionally  we plan to carryback our current year loss for tax purposes and adjust the effect of prior year restatements  resulting in an income tax receivable of approximately million and the remaining million carryforward balance has been recorded as an million deferred tax asset 
the total federal and state net operating loss carryforward  is approximately million 
the federal net operating loss carryforward will expire between tax years and and the state net operating loss carryforward from various jurisdictions will expire between tax years and the statutes of limitations for income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions for tax years through have not expired and thus these years remain subject to examination by the irs and state jurisdictions 
significant state jurisdictions that remain subject to examination include colorado  virginia and missouri for tax years through for tax years that we are no longer subject to federal  state and local tax examinations by tax authorities  the tax attribute carryforwards generated from these years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities 
during  we filed an application for change in method of tax accounting for the nextview cost share payments with the internal revenue service 
as a result of the filing  we will recognize a revenue adjustment of million annually until tax year comparisons of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  change between and amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands  except percentages revenues operating expenses direct costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative inventory impairment and satellite impairment settlement total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net other non operating expense income income before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income percentages in this table and throughout our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may reflect rounding adjustments

in  interest expense on our million indebtedness si credit agreement incurred on january  to finance our purchase of space imaging was million 
our final payment for this debt occurred in february in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in june pursuant to which the effective interest rate under the notes was fixed at through july  the fair value of the derivative instrument at december  was approximately million and was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in february  we entered into a million interest rate cap agreement that is intended to protect us from increases in interest rates by limiting our interest rate exposure to the three month libor with a cap of 
the cap option cost was million and was effective july  through january  as of december  the fair value of the interest rate cap was immaterial 
on the settlement of the interest rate swap on july   we recorded a realized loss of million 
we recorded unrealized losses of million and million on the derivative instruments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in net interest expense 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower average interest rate returns on cash balances during as compared to other non operating expense income we recorded a loss of million in the first quarter of due to the impairment of the orbview satellite 
we submitted an insurance claim on june  and received the full proceeds during the third quarter of and recognized the net million as a non operating gain 
non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that represents net income loss before depreciation and amortization expenses  net interest income or expense  loss from early extinguishment of debt  income tax expense benefit  non cash loss on inventory and investment impairments and non cash stock based compensation expense 
we present adjusted ebitda to enhance understanding of our operating performance 
we use adjusted ebitda as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an operating performance measure  and not a liquidity measure  that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under financial performance under gaap  and our calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures of other companies 
the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool has limitations and it should not considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for all contractual commitments  it does not reflect our significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness  it does not reflect cash requirements for the payment of income taxes when due  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing adjusted ebitda in isolation  and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as cash flow provided by used in operating activities and capital expenditures  to measure our liquidity 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  net income adjustments interest expense  net loss from early extinguishment of debt provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization non cash loss on inventory and investment impairments non cash stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources in thousands  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital current ratio year ended december  cash from operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above the company s principal sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and accounts receivable 
our primary cash needs are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
we believe that we currently have sufficient resources to meet our operating requirements through the next twelve months 
however  our ability to continue to be profitable and generate positive cash flow through our operations beyond that period is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control and dependent on the continued expansion of commercial and government services  adequate customer acceptance of our products and services and numerous other factors 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
during the fourth quarter  we issued million in new debt which allowed us to repurchase and discharge approximately million of our existing debt and fix our interest at a lower rate as well as providing us the financial flexibility to continue building geoeye we are in a strong cash position and continue to make prudent investments in geoeye s development  but we won t complete the launch or commissioning of geoeye on an accelerated basis without an agreement with the nga under its enhancedview program 
our nextview contract with the nga has been extended through june   with options for nga to extend the contract for an additional six months through december  we will continue to fund our capital expenditures with cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from the notes and revenues from existing contracts 
our total long term debt consists of million of notes  net of unamortized discount of million  at december  in connection with the notes offering in the fourth quarter of  the company deposited million of the net proceeds into a restricted account 
these restricted proceeds are held by a trustee for the benefit of the note holders and are only available to the company or one of its restricted subsidiaries to finance the procurement  construction and or launch of one or more satellites after the october  issue date provided that at such time of the withdrawal from the restricted account  the company or one of its subsidiaries will have been selected by nga for an award with respect to a new satellite 
as of december   the net proceeds of million is included as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
cash flow items net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to million in income tax refunds for and million in changes to the current tax receivable and deferred tax accounts offset by the timing of vendor payments 
the decrease of million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in the non current income tax reserve attributable to income taxes paid related to the nextview cost share payments as a result of a tax accounting method change in the third quarter of in addition  the decrease is offset by the increase in the deferred revenue balance in compared to which represents milestone payments received from nga for the nextview program during net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures decreased by million compared to the same period in primarily attributable to expenditures related to the construction of geoeye that were incurred in prior to the full satellite operations in february however  we also incurred million of capital expenditures for geoeye during we are continuing to evaluate our options regarding the timing for the potential construction of geoeye in conjunction with our discussions with the us government related to the enhancedview program 
in addition  there was a net transfer to restricted cash of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the net proceeds of the notes that are restricted for construction of a new high resolution satellite 
we have contracted with itt corporation to work on the camera for geoeye on march   the company announced the selection of lockheed martin space systems company to build the geoeye satellite 
we have spent million in building our next earth imaging satellite  geoeye through december  capital expenditures increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in these increased cash outflows were primarily attributable to expenditures related to the construction of geoeye and its related ground system assets 
however  million of capital expenditures in was attributable to costs incurred for the construction of geoeye during  we received million of proceeds from insurance for the loss of the orbview satellite 
in addition  during  we used million of cash to purchase the mj harden operations 
this partially offset million in capital expenditure in  primarily related to the construction of the geoeye satellite 
net cash used in or provided by financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we issued senior secured notes net of discount and net of financing costs of million  which was used to pay for the repurchase of our notes  plus accrued interest 
in addition  we received funds in the amount of million for the issuances of common stock primarily due to the exercise of warrants 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million 
the funds were primarily used to repay the remaining million balance on the debt incurred to purchase the space imaging operations in the first quarter of the funds were offset by cash provided in the amount of million for the issuance of common stock related to stock options and warrants exercised 
long term debt in october  we closed on a private placement offering of million of our notes due october  the net proceeds of the notes offering were used to fund the repurchase of million in outstanding principal  or approximately  of the company s outstanding million notes due july  as of december   our total long term debt consisted of million of notes  net of original issue discount of million 
in addition  million of the notes remained outstanding until january  at which time the company exercised its rights to discharge these final notes 
under the indenture governing the notes  we are prohibited from paying dividends until the principal amount of all such notes has been repaid 
at any time on or after october   geoeye  inc may on one or more occasions redeem all or part of the notes at of principal for the subsequent month period and at of principal on october  and thereafter 
the indenture governing our notes contains a covenant that restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness unless  among other things  we can comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we may incur additional indebtedness only if  after giving pro forma effect to that incurrence  our ratio of adjusted cash ebitda to total consolidated debt for the four fiscal quarters ending as of the most recent date for which internal financial statements are available meet certain levels or we have availability to incur such indebtedness under certain baskets in the indenture 
adjusted cash ebitda is defined as adjusted ebitda less amortization of deferred revenue related to the nextview agreement with nga 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our borrowings 
in march  we entered into a binding commitment letter to issue preferred stock and obtain debt financing totaling up to million with cerberus capital management  lp cerberus  provided that we receive an award from nga to build geoeye under the enhancedview program 
the additional indebtedness under this commitment does not cause a covenant violation under the indenture governing our notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year 
funding sources and uses on march  the company entered into a binding commitment letter with cerberus to purchase preferred stock and provide debt financing  the proceeds of which will be used for development and launch of geoeye the agreement to purchase the preferred stock and the commitment to provide financing expires on march  unless definitive documents have been executed by both parties 
cerberus will purchase up to million in preferred stock provided that the company receives an award from the nga to build geoeye under the enhancedview program 
the preferred stock will be entitled to receive a dividend at an annual rate of  payable in kind  in cash or securities  at the company s option 
the preferred stock will have a conversion price of per share  or after taking into effect the original issue discount oid 
cerberus will also provide the company with debt financing of million  also contingent upon the company receiving an award from nga to build geoeye under the enhancedview program 
the facility will mature on april  and will bear an annual interest rate of three month libor plus  with a minimum interest rate of 
there is no requirement to draw down on the facility and partial draws are permitted  with some limitations 
this additional financing is necessary due to the fact that the nga request for proposal for enhancedview requires that upon a successful contract award the company provide a letter of credit for the full amount of any potential cost share award which would be received from nga through development of geoeye and for a period of up to three years after full operational capability foc 
the company estimates that it could require letters of credit up to million  which must be fully cash collateralized 
the company will use cash on hand  cash flow from operations  proceeds from the nga cost share  and the additional financing provided by cerberus to build geoeye and post the required letters of credit 
if the company is awarded the enhanced view imagery acquisition contract without the letter of credit requirement  the company will no longer be obligated to issue  shares of preferred stock to cerberus  but cerberus will have the option to purchase a reduced number of  shares of preferred stock  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of million 
in addition  the company paid a non refundable commitment fee of or million of the face value of the debt 
in the event  the company is not awarded a new satellite contract under the enhancedview program  the company will be required to pay an additional million fee for the preferred stock commitment 
we completed the construction of and launched the geoeye satellite in contractual provisions allowed us to hold back million due to our contractors as of december  these amounts were paid in contracted backlog we have historically had and currently have a substantial backlog  which provides some assurance regarding our future revenue expectations 
backlog reduces the volatility of our net cash provided by operating activities more than would be typical for a company outside our industry 
our backlog was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  backlog includes our sla with the nga  access fee agreements with our international regional affiliates  regional affiliate ground station operations and maintenance contracts  commercial imagery contracts and value added products and services 
our backlog as of december  included approximately million of contracts with the us government  including approximately million related specifically to the sla 
in addition to this backlog  we have recently added another million with our most recent sla extension 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis  however  certain international government customers have signed multi year access fee and operating and maintenance contracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in backlog 
in addition  there is million of remaining unamortized revenue related to payments made prior to foc from nga  of which million is expected to be recognized during we have not included this in our backlog because no specific services will be rendered to recognize the revenue 
the balance will be recognized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the satellite 
capital expenditures for  our capital expenditures included million for satellites and ground systems and million for property  plant and equipment 
we currently expect our total capital expenditures  excluding the geoeye satellite  to range from approximately million to million 
we intend to fund our capital expenditure requirements through cash on hand  cash provided from operating activities  proceeds from the notes and  if necessary  additional borrowings or funding from a customer or customers 
to the extent that we sign a contract for the construction of the geoeye satellite  we would expect to incur additional capital expenditures in excess of cash on hand and cash provided from operating activities in and beyond 
the timing of the geoeye program may vary depending on our perception of the market potential  especially the potential interest from the us government 
in light of the significant capital required to build geoeye and the current state of the financial markets  timing may also vary subject to our ability to negotiate a cost share with the us government on terms which we deem to be acceptable 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 
we do not have any other significant off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations  as of december  payments due by year and contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations interest expense on long term debt purchased obligations total contractual obligations represents contractual interest payment obligations on the million outstanding principal balance of our notes  which bear interest at a rate per annum of purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding on us that meet any of the following criteria they are non cancelable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services 
if the obligation is non cancelable  the entire value of the contract is included in the table 
if the obligation is cancelable  but we would incur a penalty if cancelled  the dollar amount of the pentaly is included as a purchase obligation 
if we can unilaterally terminate the agreement simply by providing a certain number of days notice or by paying a termination fee  we have included the amount of the termination fee 
as of december   purchase obligations include ground system and communication services 
contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included 
in addition to the above  the company has entered into commitments subsequent to december   totaling up to approximately million  primarily purchase obligations  all of which expire in operating leases we have commitments for operating leases primarily relating to equipment and office and operating facilities 
these leases contain escalation provisions for increases as a result of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  revenue recognition  satellites and related ground systems  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from imaging services  the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers and the provision of direct access to our satellites and associated ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services 
we also derive significant revenue from value added production services where we combine our images with data and imagery from our own and other sources to create sophisticated information products 
we enter into fixed price  unit price and time and materials contracts with our customers 
when recognizing revenue  we consider the following we consider the nature of our contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements 
we record revenues from the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers based on the delivery of the imagery 
we recognize revenues for the provision of direct access to our satellites on a straight line basis over the delivery term of the contract 
however  certain multi year sales contracts are based on minimum levels of access time with adjustments based on usage 
we recognize revenues for the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and support services based on the delivery of these products and services 
if the satellite access service is combined with the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services and the requirements for separate revenue recognition are not met  we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the combined delivery term of the services 
revenue is recognized on contracts to provide value added production services using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recognized on each production contract based either on the contract price of units of production delivered during a period or upon costs to date plus an estimate of gross profit to date 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known 
under the units of delivery method  revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
contract costs are recognized as incurred  with costs to date of unfinished production for which revenue has not been recognized being capitalized 
under the cost plus gross profit earned method  progress toward completion is measured against all measurable deliverables based on either resources applied or cost incurred compared to total resources or cost projected for the project 
we recognize costs as incurred 
profit is determined based on our estimated profit on the contract multiplied by our progress toward completion 
revenue represents the sum of our costs and profit on the contract for the period 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
we review our contract estimates on a continual basis to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion 
at times we may receive payments from some customers in advance of providing services 
amounts received from customers pursuant to satellite access prepayment options are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as deferred revenue 
these deferred amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the agreement terms 
in addition  cost share amounts received from the us government are recorded as deferred revenue when received and recognized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the satellite 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether the collection is reasonably assured  which requires us  among other things  to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments in these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing and or amount of revenue recognition 
satellites and related ground systems satellites and related ground systems are recorded at cost 
the cost of our satellite includes capitalized interest cost incurred during the construction and development period 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellite and related ground systems include internal direct labor costs incurred in the construction and development  as well as depreciation costs related to assets which support the construction and development of our satellite and related ground systems 
during the construction phase  the costs of our satellites are capitalized  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the satellite 
the portion of any insurance premiums associated with the insurance coverage of the launch and on orbit commissioning period prior to a satellite reaching start of commercial operations  are capitalized in the original cost of the satellite and are amortized over the estimated life of the asset 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss were to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
asset impairment assessments goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we calculate the fair market value at the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the company exceeds the fair market value  impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
an impairment test was performed on recorded goodwill and it was determined that no impairment existed as of december  long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of our satellites  fixed assets and other long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be impacted by  among other things  changes in estimates of the useful lives of the assets for example  degradation in the quality of images downloaded from the satellite  changes in estimates of our ability to operate the assets at expected levels for example  due to intermittent loss of satellite transmissions and by the loss of one or several significant customer contracts 
satellites and other property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we estimate the useful lives of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance  including its orbital design life and its estimated service life 
the orbital design life of a satellite is the length of time that the manufacturer has contractually committed that the satellite s hardware will remain operational under normal operating conditions 
in contrast  a satellite s service life is the length of time the satellite is expected to remain operational as determined by remaining fuel levels and consumption rates 
our in orbit satellites generally have operational lives of nine years and service lives as high as ten years 
the useful depreciable lives of our satellites are generally the operational lives 
although the service lives of our satellites have historically extended beyond their depreciable lives  this trend may not continue 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our satellites to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary based on the health of the individual satellites 
changes in our estimate of the useful lives of our satellites could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we charge to operations the carrying value of any satellite lost as a result of a launch or in orbit failure upon the occurrence of the loss 
in the event of a partial failure  we record an impairment charge to operations upon the occurrence of the loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the satellite 
we measure the impairment charge as the excess of the carrying value of the satellite over its estimated fair value as determined by the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we reduce the charge to operations resulting from either a complete or a partial failure by the amount of any insurance proceeds that were either due and payable to or received by us  and by the amount of any deferred satellite performance incentives that are no longer applicable following the failure 
income taxes income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse 
significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of our deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
as part of our financial process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based in part on the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed more likely than not that certain tax positions will be sustained 
under sfas  a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and  if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we evaluate our tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable  based solely on its technical merits and presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and having access to all relevant facts and information 
when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard  a liability is recorded for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
additionally  for those tax positions that are determined more likely than not to be sustainable  we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit more likely than not determined by cumulative probability to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
there is limited historical information available to support our estimate of certain assumptions required to value our stock options 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we use the simplified calculation due to the lack of historical exercise data 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change

recent and pending accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued guidance on financial instruments  which amends prior authoritative guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements and also amends prior guidance to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements 
the adoption of the updated guidance did not have an effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification asc and identified the asc as the authoritative source of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the changes to the gaap hierarchy did not result in any accounting changes 
in august  the fasb revised its guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
the revised guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using certain techniques 
the revised guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability 
the revised guidance also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quote price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the adoption of the updated guidance did not have an effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
in october  the fasb issued revised guidance on revenue from multiple deliverable arrangements including principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the allocation of the consideration 
additionally  this revised guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements using estimated selling prices of deliverables if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
the new guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance and do not expect any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new guidance that require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provide clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  it requires reporting entities to disclose separately the amount of significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers and provide information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the level fair value measurements disclosures that are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this update to materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
all of our debt as of december  is fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
effective july   we had entered into an interest rate cap agreement associated with the notes that was intended to protect us from increases in interest rates by limiting our interest rate exposure to the three month libor with a cap of 
the notes were subject to interest rate fluctuation because the interest rate reset semi annually for the term of the notes 
the interest rate cap agreement was outstanding until january when we paid off the remaining balance of the notes 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate cap was zero 
we do not currently have any material foreign currency exposure 
our revenue contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and the majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars
