item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis has been prepared with reference to the historical financial condition and results of operations of air transport services group  inc  and its subsidiaries the company and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors on page of this report  our historical financial statements  and the related notes contained in this report 
introduction air transport services group  inc the company is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries include three independently certificated airlines  abx air  inc abx  capital cargo international airlines  inc ccia and air transport international  llc ati and cargo aircraft management  inc cam  an aircraft leasing company 
when the context requires  we may also use the terms company and atsg in this report to refer to the business of atsg and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
segment analysis the company has three reportable segments dhl  acmi services  and cam 
the company s other business activities do not constitute reportable segments and are included in other activities 
the company s aircraft fleet is summarized below as of december  in thousands 
dhl acmi services cam total in service aircraft aircraft owned or under capital lease boeing boeing boeing dc total carrying value operating lease aircraft in freighter modification boeing carrying value idle aircraft not scheduled for revenue aircraft owned or under capital lease dc boeing carrying value operating lease as of december   acmi services was leasing of its in service aircraft internally from cam 
as of december   cam had four boeing aircraft having a book value of million  which were in the process of being modified to standard freighter configuration and were temporarily removed from service 
acmi services had idle airframes with a carrying value of million whose engines and rotables were being used for other aircraft in the company s fleets 
the spare airframes can be reactivated  as needed 
acmi services had one aircraft under an operating lease that was not scheduled for service through the end of its lease term in october 
table of contents dhl segment the company  through abx  has had long term contacts with dhl network operations usa  inc and dhl express usa  inc 
which are collectively referred to as dhl  since august  dhl  an international  integrated delivery company  is the company s largest customer 
the dhl segment accounted for of the company s revenues from continuing operations and of the company s pre tax earnings from continuing operations in abx provides airlift including aircraft  aircraft flight crews and maintenance to dhl under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance agreement dhl acmi agreement 
this agreement will be terminated effective march  and replaced with new operating and lease agreements with dhl under a hub services agreement  which expired without renewal in august  abx provided package handling  sorting and other cargo related services to dhl 
in  dhl began to restructure its us operations due to continued losses 
dhl s restructuring significantly impacted abx s operations 
pursuant to its restructuring plans  dhl discontinued intra us domestic pickup and delivery services in january dhl now provides only international services to and from the us a summarized chronology of dhl s restructuring actions in and their effects on abx s operations follows in january  the regional sorting hubs staffed by abx were closed  the sort operations in wilmington  ohio were downsized to process only international shipments and all of abx s remaining dc aircraft were terminated from the dhl acmi agreement 
in march  dhl gave abx notice to remove five pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft having a net book value of approximately million  from the dhl network 
on march   dhl agreed to restructure an unsecured promissory note and assume financial responsibility for the capital leases associated with five boeing aircraft guaranteed by dhl 
the promissory note was subsequently amended in may and a lease assumption and option agreement was executed in june on april   dhl announced that it planned to relocate its package sorting and aircraft hub operations from the dhl air park in wilmington  ohio to the cincinnati northern kentucky international airport in hebron  kentucky cvg 
on may   dhl notified abx that dhl would not be renewing the hub services agreement when its term expired on august  on july   sort operations in wilmington ceased and the sorting and hub operations were transferred to cvg 
abx assisted dhl with the transition to cvg by providing temporary staffing for the cvg operations through early september in conjunction with the transfer of the hub operations to cvg in july  dhl assumed management of fueling services for its us network previously provided by abx 
abx ceased providing aircraft fuel and related services for its aircraft that remain in the dhl network 
the hub services operations and the aircraft fueling operations are now reported as discontinued operations 
on august   dhl notified abx that dhl would not be renewing the dhl acmi agreement when its initial term expires on august  revenues from the dhl acmi agreement were million for pre tax earnings from the dhl acmi agreement were million  or of consolidated pre tax earnings for in  abx and dhl executed a severance and retention agreement s r to facilitate the restructuring and wind down of dhl s us operations 
the s r specifies employee severance  retention and other benefits that dhl reimburses abx for payment to its employees that are affected by dhl s us restructuring plan 
through december   abx has terminated approximately  employee positions since dhl s restructuring began in mid employees received severance  retention and other benefits under the s r 
in accordance with the agreement  dhl is obligated to reimburse abx for the cost of non pilot 
table of contents employee severance  retention  productivity bonuses and vacation benefits paid 
the s r also included a provision for dhl to fund up to million contingent upon abx negotiating an agreement with its pilot union in regards to severance  retention and or other issues arising from dhl s us restructuring plan 
in december  such an agreement was reached and dhl remitted million to abx 
pre tax earnings from continuing operations included million for administering the wind down of dhl operations under the s r in in december  abx and the pilots union reached an agreement with regard to the distribution of the million provided by the s r for pilot severance and benefits 
to settle the s r funding  abx amended the pilot pension plans in december to effectively increase benefits of more senior crewmembers 
the company recorded a pension expense of million for the benefit amendments 
the company also agreed to fund the pilot pension plan with million in in addition to previously remitted contributions 
the company further agreed to pay million to terminated crewmembers for severance benefits 
as a result  pre tax earnings for included million for settling the s r fund with the crewmembers 
including the additional pension contribution of million made by the company  the settlement of the million fund will result in a net cash outflow of approximately million after all payments are completed 
our pre tax earnings from the s r for also included million for the reimbursement of employee vacation benefits that abx paid to terminated employees 
our pre tax earnings from continuing operations for included million from the s r related to reimbursed employee vacation 
pre tax earnings from the dhl acmi agreement were million for and decreased by million compared to due to the reductions in service in conjunction with dhl s us restructuring 
revenues from the dhl acmi agreement reflected revenue amendments in and which effectively fixed abx s pre tax earnings from the dhl acmi agreement for the fourth quarter of and each quarter of prior to the revenue amendments  expenses incurred under the dhl acmi agreement were generally marked up by and included in revenues 
the dhl acmi agreement also allowed abx to earn incremental revenues calculated on mark ups above the base mark up up to an additional under the dhl acmi agreement from the achievement of certain cost related and service goals specified in the two agreements 
under the revenue amendments  annual goals were not set for  nor were quarterly cost goals 
instead  the agreed revenue for includes amounts to replace these incremental revenues 
the table below compares our dhl segment earnings from continuing operations in thousands year ended december  acmi agreement s r agreement total dhl pre tax earnings outlook abx currently remains the primary provider of airlift capacity for dhl s us based international delivery network through its fleet of boeing aircraft 
in addition to boeing aircraft provided under the primary dhl acmi agreement  abx is also supplying dhl with seven boeing standard freighters under supplemental  short term acmi arrangements 
in june  abx and dhl executed a lease option agreement  which gave dhl the option to lease up to four abx boeing standard freighter aircraft under month lease terms  commencing august  in march  the company and dhl terminated the acmi agreement and executed new follow on agreements effective march  under the new agreements  dhl will lease boeing freighter aircraft from cam and abx will operate those aircraft for dhl under a separate crew  maintenance and insurance cmi agreement 
the cmi agreement is not based on a cost plus pricing arrangement  but instead 
table of contents pricing will be based on a pre defined fee  scaled for the number of aircraft operated and the number of crews provided to dhl 
the initial term of the cmi is five years  while the term of the aircraft leases are seven years 
the aircraft include the four boeing aircraft which dhl already had an option to lease under the june lease option agreement 
the terms of those option lease agreements will be extended from month terms to month terms 
under the cmi agreement  abx will be able to contract with ames to provide scheduled maintenance for the boeing aircraft 
at the initiation of the cmi agreement  cam will not have all boeing freighter aircraft available for lease to dhl 
until cam completes the aircraft modification process for the aircraft committed to dhl  abx will operate bridging aircraft for dhl under short term  month to month arrangements under economic terms similar to the leases for the aircraft 
in conjunction with terminating the acmi agreement  abx and dhl entered into a termination agreement which addressed several open issues between the parties 
the s r agreement will also be terminated effective april  and settlement of reimbursed vacation  which had been an issue of dispute between abx and dhl  was resolved 
dhl agreed to reimburse abx for million of accrued vacation payments  which is in addition to million previously reimbursed by dhl 
abx will recognize million of this reimbursement in pre tax earnings in additionally  under the termination agreement  dhl agreed to pay abx  in may  its carrying value of million to complete the sale of aircraft that abx previously put to dhl 
the termination agreement also includes a fee which abx can earn for assisting dhl in the management of workers compensation claims 
for the first quarter of  we reached an agreement with dhl for approximately the same level of mark ups and pre tax earnings for the dhl acmi agreement as were recognized for the fourth quarter of acmi services segment through its three airline subsidiaries  the company provides airlift to other airlines  freight forwarders and the us military  typically through acmi agreements 
the airlines serve a variety of customers in the air cargo industry by flying in the us  europe asia  africa and throughout the americas 
ccia and ati each have contracts to provide airlift to bax global  inc bax under acmi agreements 
bax provides freight transportation and supply chain management services  specializing in the heavy freight market for business to business shipping 
ati also provides passenger transportation  primarily to the us military  using its dc combi aircraft that are certified to carry passengers as well as cargo on the main flight deck 
at december   acmi services included in service aircraft 
abx operated boeing freighter aircraft that were not under the dhl acmi agreement  while ccia and ati operated aircraft and aircraft  respectively 
customers are usually charged based on the number of block hours flown or the amount of aircraft and crew resources provided during a reporting period 
typically agreements specify a minimum level of monthly revenue 
acmi services also include revenues from block space agreements  in which customers contract for specific amounts of space on certain flights 
in these agreements  customers are typically charged by the weight carried on the aircraft during a flight  or based on the number of aircraft load positions purchased 
acmi services revenues  excluding directly reimbursed fuel expenses  were million and million during and  respectively  decreasing in compared to the previous year 
block hours increased for  to  hours compared to  hours in increased block hours reflect additional boeing and boeing aircraft placed into service since mid the decline in revenues is due to the lower cost of aviation fuel for those acmi  block space and charter contracts that include fuel in their price 
the price per gallon of aviation fuel in declined approximately compared to excluding those contracts that include fuel  revenues per block hour declined in compared to acmi services results included revenues of million from boeing freighter aircraft that abx supplied to dhl during under short term supplemental agreements compared to million during 
table of contents pre tax earnings for acmi services were million for compared to a loss of million during our results included impairment charges totaling million to write down goodwill and customer relationship intangibles to their fair values 
the results for acmi services include losses from abx driven by a boeing transatlantic scheduled service which commenced in january we experienced higher costs for abx flight crews and lower cargo volumes than expected 
the costs of abx flight crews were detrimentally impacted due to scheduling changes caused when senior dc flight crewmembers were retrained for the boeing high levels of sick occurrences among crew members in resulted in higher pay premiums for unscheduled crewmembers who flew open routes 
in january  abx terminated the scheduled transatlantic service which generated the losses 
the operation was replaced by a conventional acmi agreement with tnt airways sa  a large international shipper 
pre tax earnings in were also negatively impacted by the timing of scheduled maintenance checks 
abx  which expenses aircraft maintenance as it is incurred  completed eight scheduled maintenance checks during  compared to six maintenance checks during ati and ccia each generated pre tax profits for outlook we believe that terminating the transatlantic scheduled service and replacing that block space agreement with a conventional acmi agreement will contribute to the segment s improved profitability in in november  the abx pilots union ratified an amended collective bargaining agreement cba which contained several key aspects that were contingent upon abx and dhl reaching a long term operating agreement 
we believe that when implemented  the amended cba provides for a lower cost structure and favorable work rules so that abx may more effectively compete in the acmi air cargo markets with lower cost carriers 
the amended cba becomes fully effective after the new cmi agreement between abx and dhl becomes effective 
new customer agreements typically involve start up expenses  including those for route authorities  overfly rights  travel and other activities  and may impact future operating results 
revenue generating service may begin sometime later  however  depending on satisfaction of a number of conditions  including international regulations and laws  contract negotiations  flight crew availability  and arranging resources for aircraft handling 
additional aircraft dry leases by cam to other airlines may adversely impact the acmi services operating results by reducing utilization levels for its aircraft 
additionally  our pre tax earnings will fluctuate due to the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance  which  under abx s policy  are expensed as maintenance is performed 
cam segment the company offers aircraft leasing through its cam subsidiary 
aircraft leases normally cover a term of several years 
in a typical leasing agreement  customers pay rent and a maintenance deposit on a monthly basis 
cam had aircraft that were under lease as of december   of them to abx  ati and ccia 
in september  cam contracted with israel aerospace industries ltd 
iai for the conversion of up to non standard boeing aircraft to full freighter configuration 
this is in addition to two boeing aircraft that cam already had contracted to modify 
the conversion primarily consists of the installation of a standard cargo door and loading system  replacing the passenger door and loading system currently in the aircraft 
since september  cam has successfully modified four boeing and one boeing into standard freighters 
all five aircraft were leased internally to the company s airlines 
the completed boeing aircraft are in service under the acmi services segment  primarily supporting dhl under short term supplemental agreements 
as of december   four boeing aircraft were undergoing freighter modification 
pre tax segment earnings for cam were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in pre tax earnings reflects eight additional aircraft that cam has placed in service since december  cam s results reflected an allocation of interest expense of million and million 
table of contents in and  respectively  based on prevailing interest rates and the carrying value of its operating assets 
cam s revenues for and included million and million  respectively  for the leasing of aircraft to ati  ccia and abx 
outlook the decision by dhl to terminate the dhl acmi agreement adds impetus to management s strategy of modifying abx s non standard boeing aircraft into standard freighter configuration 
the fuel efficiency  cubic capacity  payload and operating costs of the boeing make it a desirable freighter aircraft in medium range international air cargo markets and in trans us routes less than  nautical miles 
interest in efficient  reliable boeing aircraft remains strong 
as the modified boeing aircraft become available for service  some portion of them will be leased to dhl and others  while some may be operated by an atsg airline 
cam could modify up to eight more non standard boeing aircraft that are currently under contract to dhl under the dhl acmi agreement to a standard freighter configuration as the aircraft are removed from the dhl acmi agreement 
currently  we plan to modify all of the eight remaining non standard boeing aircraft into a standard freighter configuration 
we will consider a number of factors  including the fleet plans of customers  long term demand for airlift  the quantity and quality of customer prospects  competitive alternatives and general economic conditions  when deciding to place aircraft into the modification process 
if a non standard boeing aircraft is not placed into the modification process  we will consider other alternatives  including the sale of the aircraft  continuing to operate the aircraft as a non standard freighter  or salvaging and parting out of the aircraft to support the company s other boeing aircraft 
besides the four boeing aircraft that were undergoing modification at december   cam owned one aircraft  a boeing passenger aircraft that is scheduled for lease in the second quarter of in february  cam finalized an agreement to lease two boeing aircraft to a miami  florida based operator 
the lease agreement for the first of two aircraft began in march and the second is expected to begin in the second quarter of these aircraft leases are starting later than expected because additional time was required by the customer to obtain faa approval and train pilots for the boeing aircraft 
the miami  florida based operator has an option to lease up to three additional boeing aircraft 
other activities through separate subsidiaries  the company sells aircraft parts and provides aircraft maintenance and modification services to other airlines 
the company also operates three us postal service usps sorting facilities 
the company also provides equipment leasing and facility maintenance  as well as specialized services for aircraft fuel management and freight logistics 
these other business activities do not constitute reportable segments 
other activities include general and administrative expenses not associated with the dhl commercial agreements  including an allocation of abx s overhead expenses  starting january  in may  the aircraft maintenance and engineering business operations of abx were transferred to a newly formed atsg subsidiary  airborne maintenance and engineering services  inc ames 
organizing the aircraft maintenance and engineering capabilities separately from abx facilitates a cost structure and marketing organization which can better compete in the aircraft maintenance industry 
ames operates as a federal aviation administration faa certificated repair station  utilizing the wilmington  ohio facilities  including hangars and a component shop  leased by abx from dhl 
abx is ames s primary customer at this time 
ames leverages the company s existing engineering skills and technical experience to perform airframe maintenance  component repairs  part sales  line maintenance and avionics modifications for other atsg airlines  as well as external customers 
revenues from all other activities increased million during compared to increased revenues were primarily a result of an increase in aircraft and facility maintenance services when compared to 
table of contents pre tax earnings from all other activities were million during compared to million in lower pre tax earnings for compared to were a result of a net gain of million recorded in stemming from the insurance proceeds for an aircraft which experienced a fire prior to engine start and a charge of million in for professional fees stemming from the arbitration of a dispute with dhl 
outlook under the follow on agreements reached with dhl  ames will continue to provide maintenance services for the company s boeing aircraft that operate in the dhl network 
our three contracts with the usps generated revenues of million in these contracts have a four year term  with original expiration dates in either september or october with multi year extensions at the discretion of the usps 
it is our understanding at this time that the usps plans to maintain the three sorting centers that we operate

as of december   cam had three aircraft which were in the process of being modified to standard freighter configuration 
dhl segment on may   dhl announced a plan to restructure its us business and eight months later ceased its intra us domestic pickup and delivery services 
as a result  abx s revenues from the dhl acmi agreement declined in compared to due to reductions in the services provided to dhl during pre tax earnings for the dhl segment were million for compared to million for in november  abx and dhl amended the pricing provisions of the acmi agreement revenue amendment 
the revenue amendment  which became effective october   effectively fixed abx s pre tax earnings for the dhl agreements for the fourth quarter of  including the incremental mark ups 
under the revenue amendment  abx billed dhl the base revenues and incremental revenues that abx would have earned based on its service and cost performance levels had the dhl restructuring not occurred 
additionally  under the s r agreement  dhl reimbursed abx for employee accrued vacation benefits that abx paid to terminated employees 
pre tax earnings for in the dhl segment  included million in reimbursement of vacation benefits paid to employees 
acmi services segment acmi services revenues  excluding reimbursed expenses  were million for  increasing million compared to approximately million of this growth was organic to abx  while the remaining increase resulted from the acquisition of ati and ccia 
abx s organic growth reflects the deployment of four additional boeing aircraft into service since mid the acmi services segment had a pre tax loss of million for  including impairment charges of million for goodwill and intangible assets 
the acmi services segment had pre tax earnings of million for and there were no impairment charges 
in  segment results for acmi services were positively impacted by ccia and ati  which contributed million to pre tax earnings 

table of contents in  abx incurred significant maintenance expenses compared to periods due to planned c checks  which are expensed as incurred for boeing aircraft 
abx flight crew wages negatively impacted results  when abx flight crews decided not to voluntarily bid for extra flying  as is customary 
as a result  abx assigned the trips at an additional cost 
during  ati and ccia incurred approximately million of expenses excluding intercompany lease charges of million from cam while completing the faa certification process to add aircraft types to their respective operating certificates 
ati added the boeing to its operating certificate  while ccia added the boeing acmi services results included revenues of million from boeing freighter aircraft that abx supplied during under a supplemental agreement with dhl 
additionally  abx charged a carrying cost to dhl for ad hoc usage of abx boeing aircraft that were not under the dhl acmi agreement 
such costs were based on block hours flown and a pre established rate 
the costs are included in acmi expenses subject to mark up and accordingly reflected in the dhl segment revenues with a corresponding expense reduction to acmi services 
acmi services expenses were credited million for the global economic recession affected us customers  including bax 
ati and ccia each reduced their planned flying for bax in by removing aircraft from bax s us network 
ati planned to operate seven aircraft in the bax network in compared to nine dc aircraft in  and ccia planned to operate eight aircraft in  compared to twelve boeing aircraft for bax s us network in in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we tested the recorded goodwill associated with ati and ccia for impairment 
to test the goodwill  we determined the fair values of ati and ccia separately using industry market multiples and discounted cash flows  utilizing a market derived rate of return 
after comparing the fair values of each reporting unit to their respective carrying values  the company recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce the combined ati and ccia goodwill to million in the impairment charge was precipitated by a large scale drop in market values of transportation companies and higher costs of capital emerging from the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of projected cash flows for the airlines were expected to decline beginning in due to the deep economic recession 
in conjunction with the goodwill test  we recorded a charge of million in to reduce ati s and ccia s customer relationship intangibles to their fair value at december  the company recognized an impairment charge in december  because the carrying amount of the finite lived intangible was determined to not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of the finite lived intangible assets was determined to not be recoverable because the carrying amount exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment charge was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded its fair value 
the fair value of these assets was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates using the guidance under fasb asc topic property  plant  and equipment  separately from a discounted cash flow model used for goodwill impairment 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital based on market participant assumptions 
the impairment charge reflects lower projected revenues and earnings in future years from existing customers 
deep recessionary conditions in the us caused the demand for airlift from ati and ccia s major customer to decline 
additionally  ati experienced reductions in flying for the us military 
cam segment segment earnings for cam were million for and reflect an allocation of interest expense based on prevailing interest rates and the carrying value of its operating assets 
cam s revenues included million for the leasing of aircraft to ati  ccia and abx 
at december   cam had aircraft that were under lease to subsidiaries of the company  including two idle aircraft 
during  cam began leasing two boeing aircraft to an external customer under a long term lease 
cam had two boeing aircraft and one boeing aircraft that were undergoing freighter modification as of december  
table of contents other activities revenues from other activities increased million to million in compared increased revenues were primarily a result of an increase in aircraft parts sales and maintenance services when compared to of this increase  million was for the inter company aircraft part sales and maintenance services within the atsg companies 
internal sales and earnings were eliminated from the consolidated results 
pre tax earnings from other activities were million in compared to million in pre tax earnings in included a net gain of approximately million related to the disposition of an abx boeing aircraft that experienced a fire prior to engine start 
the aircraft was fully insured and the company s insurer rendered the aircraft a complete loss 
this gain was offset in by expenses resulting from an arbitration matter with dhl 
in accordance with the arbitrator s ruling  abx recorded a million non reimbursable expense in for professional fees stemming from astar air cargo s astar indication of interest and issued a corresponding expense credit to dhl 
additionally  abx and dhl agreed to an overhead allocation of million for  thus reducing revenue from dhl and increasing non dhl expenses accordingly 
discontinued operations our pre tax earnings from discontinued dhl operations increased by million for compared to our pre tax earnings from the discontinued dhl operations for included million for the reimbursement of employee vacation benefits that abx paid to terminated employees under the s r agreement

the company also repaid million of chi s existing indebtedness under its senior credit facility and acquired approximately million in chi cash 
the overall transaction value was approximately million 
the company obtained million of these funds from a new unsubordinated term loan 
the acquisition of chi and its wholly owned subsidiaries results in a number of strategic benefits  including improved economies from a larger base of operations and expanded market leadership in boeing freighter services

as abx s operations for dhl were scaled back  cash in flows from the operations declined while vendors and former employees were paid 

table of contents all of the cash generated from the discontinued operations was classified as operating cash flows because there were no assets or debts related to discontinued operations that generated investing or financing cash flows

net operating cash generated from discontinued operations was million in primarily reflecting advances from dhl for aircraft fuel costs 
capital expenditures cash payments for capital expenditures were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
capital spending levels were primarily a result of aircraft acquisitions and related freighter modification costs

as amended on may   the company agreed to pay dhl million of the principal balance of the dhl promissory note  while dhl agreed to extinguish an additional million of its principal balance 
we expect to pay the million from the proceeds of aircraft puts the company has billed to dhl  when the sale of the aircraft to dhl is completed see note b to the accompanying financial statements 
the due date for the remaining million remains unchanged  august until that time  the promissory note continues to bear interest at a rate of per annum  and dhl will continue to reimburse abx the interest expense from the note at least through unconditional purchase obligations of million as of december  reflects the estimated remaining cost to complete the modification of four aircraft that were undergoing freighter conversion at year end if cam were to cancel the conversion program as of december   it would owe the vendor  iai  in addition to payments for aircraft currently undergoing modification  approximately million for non recurring engineering costs and approximately million associated with additional conversion part kits which have been ordered 
employee severance and retention benefits reflect amounts payable under the s r agreement with dhl 
abx provides employee severance benefits  retention payments and vacation payouts to abx employees that are affected by dhl s restructuring plans 
dhl is contractually obligated to reimburse abx after abx makes the related benefit payments

 accounting for income taxes 
at december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million includes million recorded as a non current liability that would be paid from cash and a million reduction to the net operating loss deferred tax asset 
the amount of the liability and the timing of its recognition are subject to significant uncertainty and are contingent on the occurrence of future events  such as audits and examinations by various income tax authorities 
the company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employee groups 
the table above does not include cash contributions for pension funding due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
the timing of pension and post retirement healthcare payments cannot be reasonably determined  except for million scheduled to be paid in  including million that abx agreed to contribute to the pilots plan if a follow on cmi agreement was reached with dhl 
we will periodically evaluate whether to make additional contributions 
provisions of the company s credit agreement requires that cash proceeds from the sale of equipment and recoveries from insurance proceeds must be reinvested in like kind assets within days of receipt or remitted as a repayment against the term loan 
aggregate proceeds exceeding million in a calendar year must be remitted as a repayment against the term loan  except that the company is not required to remit proceeds from the put of aircraft to dhl toward the term loan 
at this time  we do not anticipate a required repayment of the term loan with proceeds from the sale of equipment or insurance recoveries 
liquidity at december   the company had approximately million of cash balances 
the company had million of unused credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  through a syndicated credit agreement that expires in december as of december   dhl owed the company million 
additionally  abx has million of aircraft that are in the process of being sold to dhl 
conversely  the company has significant liabilities and commitments stemming from the wind down of dhl s operations including employee severance  retention and benefits 
based on the newly executed follow on agreements with dhl  the company is scheduled to be fully paid for the aircraft in may 
table of contents credit agreement through its credit agreement  the company has a syndicated  unsubordinated term loan and a revolving credit facility that are collateralized by substantially all the aircraft  property and equipment owned by the company that are not separately collateralized under aircraft loans or capital leases 
the lenders currently consist of us based banks 
under the credit agreement  the company is subject to expenses  covenants and warranties that are usual and customary 
the credit agreement contains covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  and the level of annual capital expenditures 
the credit agreement stipulates events of default including unspecified events that may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the conditions of the credit agreement and the aircraft loans cross default 
if a lender within the credit agreement declares a material adverse event mae  availability under the revolving credit facility will be reduced by that lender s portion of the facility 
further  the credit agreement provides that if lenders having more than half of the outstanding dollar amount of the commitments assert that an mae exists at the time the company attempts to borrow under the credit facility  they can assert that an event of default exists under the credit agreement and require the lead bank to exercise its remedies 
if an event of default occurs  the company may be forced to repay  renegotiate or replace the credit agreement 
considering the current tight credit markets  the interest rates and other costs of a renegotiated or new facility  assuming the company could obtain a new facility  would be more expensive and may require more rapid amortization of principal than under the terms of the current credit agreement 
the company is in compliance with all financial covenants specified in the credit agreement 
outlook through cam  we have contracted with an aircraft maintenance and modification provider  iai  to convert some of abx s boeing aircraft from passenger door loading systems to standard freighter configuration 
cam has the right to convert up to eight more boeing aircraft at iai through we currently plan to modify all of these aircraft as well as complete four aircraft that were in the modification process as of december  we plan to finance the cost of modifying aircraft with existing cash  cash generated from aircraft sold to dhl under existing put options  and cash generated from operations during the modification period 
we estimate the total level of capital spending for will be approximately million 
the company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employee groups see note k to the accompanying financial statements 
scheduled cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plans are currently estimated to be at least million in we will periodically evaluate whether to make additional contributions 
management currently believes that the company has adequate sources of liquidity in place to operate its businesses  make planned capital expenditures  meet its anticipated financial obligations and remain in compliance with its financial covenants during these sources of liquidity include its internally generated cash flows  funds from the sale of aircraft to dhl and the availability of credit under the company s credit agreement 
there are circumstances beyond the company s control that could adversely impact liquidity in the near term  such as weakening demand for boeing aircraft  the failure to recover wind down and termination costs from of dhl  or a decision by the company s lenders to declare an event of default under the credit agreement 
if management should conclude that the company has insufficient liquidity to fund its operations  it would carefully evaluate a number of alternatives including the sale of assets  the suspension of planned capital expenditures  further cost reductions in its operations and the securing of additional financing 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special 
table of contents purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
certain of our operating leases and agreements contain indemnification obligations to the lessor or one or more other parties that are considered ordinary and customary eg use  tax and environmental indemnifications  the terms of which range in duration and are often limited 
such indemnification obligations may continue after the expiration of the respective lease or agreement 
no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of guarantees and indemnifications 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as certain disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in certain cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques which could be selected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our selection of policies and the estimation techniques we use  including those related to revenue recognition  post retirement liabilities  bad debts  self insurance reserves  accruals for labor contract settlements  valuation of spare parts inventory  useful lives  salvage values and impairment of property and equipment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant and critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from dhl were determined based on expenses incurred during a period under the two commercial agreements with dhl and are recognized when the related services were performed 
except for the amendments described below  expenses incurred under these agreements were generally subject to a base mark up of  which was recognized in the period the expenses were incurred 
certain costs  the most significant of which include interest on the promissory note due to dhl  rent  ramp and landing fees  incurred under the two commercial agreements were reimbursed and included in revenues without mark up 
both agreements also allowed the company to earn incremental mark up above the base mark up up to under the dhl acmi agreement  and under the hub services agreement as determined from the achievement of certain cost related and service goals outlined in the two commercial agreements 
the agreements stipulated the setting of quarterly and annual cost related goals and annual service goals expressly specified in each of the two agreements 
the company measured quarterly goals and records incremental revenues in the quarter in which earned 
historically  at the end of each fiscal year  the company measured the achievement of annual goals and recorded any incremental revenues earned by achieving the annual goals during the fourth quarter 
abx and dhl amended the dhl acmi agreement and the hub services agreement to set the base mark up and incremental mark up to specific amounts for the fourth quarter of and for each quarter of under these revenue amendments  annual goals were not set for  nor was a quarterly cost goal 
instead  the agreed revenue for each of the four quarters of included amounts to replace the incremental 
table of contents revenues 
in  abx and dhl executed a severance and retention agreement s r agreement which specifies employee severance  retention and other benefits that dhl reimburses abx for payment to its employees that are displaced in conjunction with dhl s us restructuring plan 
the company s revenues for includes reimbursement for certain expenses incurred under the commercial agreements  the incremental revenues set by the revenue amendments and reimbursement for employee severance  retention and other benefit costs incurred during the year 
acmi revenues from customers other than dhl are typically recognized based on hours flown or the amount of aircraft and crew resources provided during a reporting period 
charter service revenues are recognized on scheduled and non scheduled flights when the specific flight has been completed 
aircraft parts and fuel sales are recognized when the parts and fuel are delivered 
revenues earned and expenses incurred in providing aircraft related maintenance  repair or technical services are recognized in the period in which the services are completed and delivered to the customer 
revenues derived from transporting freight and sorting parcels are recognized upon delivery of shipments and completion of service 
lease revenues from aircraft leases are recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we assess in the fourth quarter of each year whether the company s goodwill acquired in acquisitions is impaired 
additional assessments may be performed on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators occur 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the company has two reporting units  ati  and cam that have goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of ati separately using a market approach and an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows applied to a market derived rate of return 
we estimate the fair value of cam using only the income approach due to lack of appropriate market comparables 
the market approach utilizes market multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
the market multiples include revenues  ebit earnings before interest and taxes and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we derive cash flow assumptions from many factors including recent market trends  expected revenues  cost structure  aircraft maintenance schedules and long term strategic plans for the deployment of aircraft 
key assumptions under the discounted cash flow models included projections for the number of aircraft in service  capital expenditures  long term growth rates  operating cash flows and market derived discount rates 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step is performed 
in the second step  fair values are assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference and charged to operations 
we have used the assistance of an independent business valuation firm in estimating an expected market rate of return  and in the development of a market approach for ati using multiples of ebitda  ebit and revenues from comparable publicly traded companies 
based on our analysis  as of december   cam and ati s fair values each exceeded their carrying values by 

table of contents the company s key assumptions used for goodwill testing include uncertainties 
those uncertainties include the level of demand for cargo aircraft by shippers  the us military and freight forwarders and cam s ability to lease aircraft near expected modification completion dates 
we anticipate  as of december   that cam will successfully modify at least twelve boeing aircraft into standard freighter configuration over the next two years this is in addition to five aircraft modifications during and deploy them with dhl and other customers under long term lease agreements 
we expect that ati will continue to operate for its major customer and for the us military 
the demand for customer airlift is projected based on inputs from customers  the volume of bids requested by the us military  management s interface with customer planning personnel and aircraft utilization trends 
certain events or changes in circumstances could negatively impact our key assumptions 
customer preferences for cargo aircraft may be impacted by changes in aviation fuel prices 
dhl and other customers may decide that they do not need as many aircraft as projected  or they may find alternative airlift 
the company s finite lived intangible assets are for customer relationships acquired with ati 
these assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the fair value of this asset was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates using the guidance under fasb asc topic property  plant and equipment separately from a discounted cash flow model used for goodwill impairment 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital  based on market participant assumptions 
depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the lesser of the asset s useful life or lease term 
we periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment 
the acceleration of depreciation expense or the recording of significant impairment losses could result from changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we may change the estimated useful lives due to a number of reasons  such as the existence of excess capacity in our air system or ground networks  or changes in regulations grounding or limiting the use of aircraft 
self insurance we self insure certain claims relating to workers compensation  aircraft  automobile  general liability and employee healthcare 
we record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data  recent claims trends and  in the case of employee healthcare and workers compensation  an independent actuarial evaluation 
changes in claim severity and frequency could result in actual claims being materially different than the costs provided for in our results of operations 
we maintain excess claim coverage with common insurance carriers to mitigate our exposure to large claim losses 
contingencies we are involved in legal matters that have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there also can be no assurance that we know all matters that may be brought against us at any point in time 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been 
table of contents recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has significant deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards nol cfs for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in based upon projections of taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that all the net deferred tax assets  related to federal income taxes  including the nol cf s will be realized prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we do not have an allowance against these deferred tax assets at this time 
during  we placed a valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets because the reduced flying from dhl s restructuring limited our ability to utilize them 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
post retirement obligations the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans for abx s flight crewmembers and other eligible employees 
the company also sponsors non qualified  unfunded excess plans that provide benefits to executive management and crewmembers that are in addition to amounts permitted to be paid through our qualified plans under provisions of the tax laws 
by december   we had amended each defined benefit plan to freeze the accrual of additional benefits and we had provided notification to the affected employees 
the company also sponsors unfunded post retirement healthcare plans for abx s flight crewmembers and non flight crewmember employees 
the accounting and valuation for these post retirement obligations are determined by prescribed accounting and actuarial methods that consider a number of assumptions and estimates 
the selection of appropriate assumptions and estimates is significant due to the long time period over which benefits will be accrued and paid 
the long term nature of these benefit payouts increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our post retirement costs 
in actuarially valuing our pension obligations and determining related expense amounts  assumptions we consider most sensitive are discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets and future salary increases 
other assumptions concerning retirement ages  mortality and employee turnover also affect the valuations 
for our post retirement healthcare plans  consideration of future medical cost trend rates is an important assumption in valuing these obligations 
actual results and future changes in these assumptions could result in future costs that are materially different than those recorded in our annual results of operations 
our actuarial valuation includes an assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 
our assumed rate of return is based on a targeted long term investment allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equities  fixed income  real estate and cash 
the company s pension investments include million of the company s assets whose fair values have been estimated in the absence of readily determinable fair values 
such investments include private equity  multi fund investments and real estate funds 
management s estimates are based on information provided by the fund managers or general partners of those funds 
in evaluating our assumption regarding expected long term investment returns on plan assets  we consider a number of factors including our historical plan returns in connection with our asset allocation policies  assistance from investment consultants hired to provide oversight over our actively managed investment portfolio and long term inflation assumptions 
the selection of the expected return rate materially affects our pension costs 
we reduced our expected long term rate of return from to after analyzing current expected returns on investment vehicles 
if we were to lower our long term rate of return assumption by a hypothetical basis points  expense in would be increased by approximately million 
we use a market value of assets as of the measurement date for determining pension expense 

table of contents in selecting the interest rate to discount estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation  we match the plan s benefit payment streams to high quality bonds of similar maturities 
the selection of the discount rate not only affects the reported funded status information as of december as shown in note k to the accompanying financial statements but also affects the succeeding year s pension and post retirement healthcare costs 
the discount rates selected for december   based on the method described above  was for three plans and for two plans 
if we were to lower our discount rates by a hypothetical basis points  pension expense in would be increased by approximately million 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is no longer a significant estimate in determining pension costs because each defined benefit pension plan was frozen during with respect to additional benefit accruals 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the aforementioned assumptions on our pension expense in thousands effect of change december  change in assumption pension expense funded status accumulated other comprehensive income pre tax basis point decrease in rate of return basis point decrease in discount rate aggregate effect of all the above changes discontinued operations in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic presentation of financial statements  a business component whose operations are discontinued is reported as discontinued operations if the cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and the company will no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the business component 
the results of discontinued operations are aggregated and presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations 
fasb asc topic requires the reclassification of amounts presented for prior years to reflect their classification as discontinued operations 
exit activities we account for the costs associated with exit activities in accordance with fasb asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations 
one time  involuntary employee termination benefits are generally expensed when the company communicates the benefit arrangement to the employee that it will no longer require the services of the employee beyond a minimum retention period 
liabilities for contract termination costs associated with exit activities are recognized in the period incurred and measured initially at fair value 
pension obligations are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits in the event that the expected working life of employees is significantly reduced due to terminations or a pension plan is suspended 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu no 
pertaining to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance will affect accounting and reporting for companies that enter into multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with their customers when those arrangements are within the scope of asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be 
table of contents allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted and the guidance may be applied retroactively 
we are currently evaluating the impact that asu no 
will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which incorporates into the fasb codification amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  made by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for variable interest entities  to require that a comprehensive qualitative analysis be performed to determine whether a holder of variable interests in a variable interest entity also has a controlling financial interest in that entity 
in addition  the amendments require that the same type of analysis be applied to entities that were previously designated as qualified special purpose entities 
the amendments are effective as of the start of the first annual reporting period beginning after november   for interim periods within the first annual reporting period  and for all subsequent annual and interim reporting periods 
we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we have million of fixed interest rate debt and million of variable interest rate debt outstanding 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term debt through a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
as of december   a increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt by approximately million 
to reduce the effects of fluctuating libor based interest rates on interest payments that stem from its variable rate outstanding debt  the company entered into interest rate swaps in january under the interest rate swap agreements  the company will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate that resets quarterly based on libor 
for the outstanding notional value  the company expects that the amounts received from the floating leg of the interest rate swap will offset fluctuating payments for interest expense because interest rates for its outstanding debt and the interest rate swap are both based on libor and reset quarterly 
the notional values were million as of december  see note m in the accompanying financial statements for discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions 
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits  cash equivalents  marketable securities and derivatives 
as part of our risk management process  we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business 
the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated 
we are exposed to counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted 
at december   the abx defined benefit pension plan had total investment assets of million under investment management 
see note k in the accompanying financial statements for further discussion of these assets 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by reimbursement through the dhl acmi agreement and charter agreements with other customers
