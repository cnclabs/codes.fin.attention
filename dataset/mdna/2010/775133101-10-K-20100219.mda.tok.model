item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k 
business overview company background and strategy we are a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer electronics  mass transit  automotive  ground transportation  defense and alternative energy 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily oem s and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
our ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions 
it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on sales and earnings 
our current focus is on worldwide markets that have an increasing percentage of materials being used to support growing high technology applications  such as cellular base stations and antennas  handheld wireless devices  satellite television receivers  wind and solar energy applications and hybrid electric and electric vehicles 
we continue to focus on business opportunities around the globe  particularly in the asian marketplace  as evidenced by the continued investment in our facilities in suzhou  china  which functions as our manufacturing base serving our customers in asia 
our goal is to become the supplier of choice for our customers in all of the various markets in which we participate 
to achieve this goal  we strive to make the best products in these respective markets and to deliver the highest level of service to our customers 
executive summary we began in the midst of the global economic recession  which had a significant negative impact on our business  particularly in the first half of the year 
our management team responded to the economic downturn early in the year through aggressive cost cutting measures  including reductions in work force  as well as strategic reviews of our businesses 
these strategic reviews led in part to the recognition of certain impairments and other one time charges in the second quarter of overall in  sales declined by approximately from million in to million in in  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share as compared to net income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in results included a charge  in the second quarter  of million related to the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax asset  as well as million of other net one time charges  primarily related to asset impairments  severance and discrete tax adjustments  partially offset by a million gain on the acquisition of certain assets of mti global  inc note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
these charges were primarily due to the impact the economic downturn had on certain businesses  as well as strategic decisions made by management related to the future direction of certain businesses and the reduction in the cost structure and work force necessitated by the overall decline in our business 
although the first half of the year was a challenge from both a sales and operations standpoint  we began to experience a rebound late in the second quarter of that carried through the end of the year 
in the third and fourth quarters  sales volumes increased approximately as compared to the first and second quarters sales of million and million  respectively  in the first and second quarters of  compared to million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively and we returned to profitability in the second half of the year 
the reductions in the workforce and the cost cutting measures that occurred in the first half of the year allowed the company to become much more streamlined  which further enabled a return to profitability at much lower sales volumes than would have been possible before such actions were taken 
although we will have to add back certain costs in the coming years  due primarily to salary increases and incentive compensation programs that were eliminated in  we believe that many costs will not return  which will enable us to become more profitable when and if sales volumes grow  depending in large part on our future sales mix  both from a geographic and product standpoint 
strategically  we continue to focus on growing our business as the economy recovers 
we have focused resources on our new business development activities  which include exploring acquisition opportunities that range from acquiring existing companies to making strategic investments in early growth stage companies  as well as investing in technologies adjacent to our own 
in  the efforts of this group led to the acquisition of certain assets of mti global  inc  a silicone foam manufacturer  in the second quarter and a strategic investment in solicore  inc  a leader in embedded power solutions  offering its patented flexion advanced ultra thin  flexible  lithium polymer batteries for smart cards  controlled access cards  rfid tags  and medical devices  in the third quarter 
our management team is also focused on growing our business organically through existing and new products by gaining market share in existing markets  expanding into new  developing markets  as well as through product extensions in both existing and new applications 
our management team believes that  although it seems that the most difficult times are behind us  many challenges still lie ahead as the economy continues to struggle to recover as we enter into however  based on the strategic decisions and changes made in  management believes it is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that are presented over the coming months and years that will enable us to profitably grow rogers in the future 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales gross margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income loss equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income  net net investment losses interest income  net acquisition gain income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales is attributable to declines at all of our reportable segments  most notably our custom electrical components segment  which declined by year over year  our high performance foams reportable segment  which declined by  and our printed circuit materials reportable segment  which declined as compared to the prior year 
a primary driver of these declines was the global economic recession that severely impacted our volumes in  particularly in the first half of the year 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased by approximately basis points to in from in margins decreased at all three of our strategic reportable segments  with the most significant declines occurring in our custom electrical components and high performance foams reportable segments with declines of and  respectively  in as compared to these margins were significantly impacted by the volume declines experienced during the year  particularly in the beginning of the year as margins in the first quarter our low point for sales were approximately 
as the year progressed  volumes increased and the company s cost cutting efforts  which were initiated in the first and second quarters of  began to take effect  which resulted in sequential margin improvement  as evidenced by fourth quarter margins of  which were more comparable to levels achieved during  albeit on lower average volumes 
our margins will continue to be driven to a large extent by both our volume levels and product mix 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million from million in expenses declined  partially as a result of the cost cutting measures initiated during the first quarter of as a result of the global economic recession 
results included approximately million of one time costs related to a product liability claim on our printed circuit material products and million of costs associated with the integration of mti global operations  as well as approximately million of incremental costs related to our deferred benefit pension plan as a result of the decline in asset value during results included a one time charge of approximately million related to the settlement of and legal fees for our lawsuit with calamp see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion  as well as incentive compensation expense of approximately million 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased in to from in  primarily as a result of the significant decline in sales experienced in as compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by from million in to million in this decline was due in part to the timing of expenditures  as well as overall cost reductions as part of the cost reduction program initiated in the first half of as a percentage of sales  expenses remained consistent at for and in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges of which million is recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
the restructuring and impairment charges were comprised of the following million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets in our flexible circuit materials million  durel million  advanced circuit materials million  thermal management systems million and high performance foams operations million  million in severance related to a global workforce reduction  and million in charges related to additional inventory reserves related to the restructuring of our durel and flexible circuit materials operations  which is recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are discussed in greater detail below 
flexible circuit materials in the second quarter of as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would exit the flexible circuit materials market and effectively discontinue any new product development or research in this area 
over the past several years  the flexible circuit materials market has experienced increased commoditization of its products  resulting in increased competition and extreme pricing pressures 
in  we took certain initial actions to streamline our flexible circuit materials business  including shifting production of certain products to our joint venture in taiwan  and retaining only certain  higher margin products 
however  we determined that the future markets for these products were very limited and did not fit with the strategic direction of the company 
therefore  we determined that we would immediately stop production of certain remaining flexible circuit materials products and continue to support only select customers for a limited time period going forward  ultimately resulting in the abandonment of our wholly owned flexible circuit materials business 
as a result of these management decisions  we determined it appropriate to evaluate the assets related to this business for valuation issues 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge related to specific equipment located in our belgian facility 
this equipment was to be used primarily for the development of certain flexible circuit materials related products  however  based on the decision to abandon the business  this equipment is no longer of use to us 
we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million related to this equipment and wrote it down to an estimated salvage value of approximately million 
this charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations and is contained in our other polymer products reportable segment 
we also recorded an impairment charge on a building located in suzhou  china that was built to support our flexible circuit materials business in the asian marketplace 
we are currently marketing this building for sale and have classified it as an asset held for sale and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reflect the current fair market value of the building less costs to sell 
the remaining asset value of million will be classified as an asset held for sale in the current asset section of our consolidated statements of financial position 
the impairment charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations and is contained in our other polymer products reportable segment 
further  as part of the decision to exit the flexible circuit materials business  we recorded additional reserves on certain inventory that will no longer be sold  of approximately million 
this charge is reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations and is contained in our printed circuit materials reportable segment 
we also recorded an impairment charge on certain other assets pertaining to the flexible circuit materials business in asia of approximately million  which is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations and is contained in our other polymer products reportable segment 
high performance foams during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our manufacturing facility located in richmond  virginia which was acquired as part of the acquisition of certain assets of mti inc the building was classified as an asset held for sale when acquired in the second quarter of current market conditions resulted in the fourth quarter impairment charge 
this charge is in our high performance foams reportable segment 
durel over the past few years  our durel electroluminescent el lamp business has steadily declined as new technologies have emerged to replace these lamps in cell phone and other related applications 
in the second quarter of  we took initial steps to restructure the durel business for this decline  as we shifted the majority of manufacturing to our china facility and recorded impairment charges on certain us based assets 
since that time  we have continued to produce el lamps out of our china facility at gradually declining volumes and our management team has initiated efforts to develop new product applications using our screen printing technology 
our initial forecasts indicated the potential for new applications to go to market in the second half of  however  at this point we have not successfully developed any new applications that we currently estimate would generate material cash flows in the future 
we concluded that this situation  plus the fact that our el lamp production is now primarily limited to automotive applications as there are no longer material sales into the handheld market as of the second quarter of  is an indicator of impairment 
the resulting analysis concluded that these assets should be treated as abandoned  as they are not in use and we do not anticipate the assets being placed in use in the near future 
as such  these assets were written down to their current fair value  which in this case approximates salvage value as there is not a readily available market for these assets since the technology is becoming obsolete 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to these assets  resulting in a remaining book value of approximately million 
this charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
further  as a result of reaching end of life on certain handheld applications  we recorded additional inventory reserves of approximately million  as this inventory no longer has any value or future use 
this charge is reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the continued decline in the durel business  as described above  we made the decision to market for sale the durel facility located in chandler  arizona 
as a result of this decision  the fair value of the building was appraised at approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
technically  the building does not meet the definition of an asset held for sale  per the relevant accounting guidance  and therefore it will continue to be classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated statement of financial position at december  these charges are reported in our custom electrical components reportable segment 
advanced circuit materials early in  management determined based on forecasts at that time  that we would need additional capacity for our high frequency products later that year 
management had already undertaken initiatives to build additional capacity through a new facility on our china campus  but needed a solution to fill interim capacity needs 
therefore  we initiated efforts to move idle equipment from our belgian facility to our arizona facility and incurred costs of approximately million due to these efforts 
at the end of  our overall business began to decline due in part to the global recession  and management determined that we would not need this equipment at that time but that we would still need certain capacity later in prior to the china capacity coming on line 
however  in  business did not recover as quickly as anticipated and we now believe that we will not need this equipment as we currently have sufficient capacity to meet our current needs and the china facility will be available in time to satisfy any increase in demand 
therefore  we have determined that the costs incurred related to the relocation of this equipment should be impaired and equipment purchased or refurbished as part of the relocation should be written down to an estimated salvage value  resulting in a charge of approximately million  which is reflected in the restructuring and impairment line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are reported in our printed circuit materials reportable segment 
thermal management systems in the second quarter of as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would abandon the development of certain products related to our thermal management systems start up business  specifically products related to our thermal interface material tim 
we have not been successful in developing this product and are not confident in its future market potential  therefore  we chose to abandon its development to focus solely on the development of aluminum silicon carbide products  which we believe have a stronger market potential 
this decision resulted in a charge of approximately million from the impairment of certain assets related to tim production 
this charge is reflected in the restructuring and impairment line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are reported in our other polymer products reportable segment 
severance in the first half of  we announced certain cost reduction initiatives that included a workforce reduction and a significant reduction in our operating and overhead expenses in an effort to better align our cost structure with the lower sales volumes experienced at the end of and in as a result  we recognized approximately million in severance charges in  and paid out approximately million in severance during a summary of the activity in the severance accrual as of december  is as follows balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  these charges are included in the restructuring and impairment charges line item on our consolidated statements of operations and are reported across all reportable segments 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in the decrease is primarily driven by the continued decline of our flexible circuits joint venture in taiwan  rogers chang chun technology  co  combined with the decline experienced in our polyurethane foam joint venture with inoac corporation in china  which experienced weakened demand  due primarily to the impact of the global recession  as well as excess inventory in the supply chain  particularly in the first half of the year 
sales improved in the third and fourth quarters  particularly at ris  primarily due to the improvement in the chinese economy in the second half of other income other income decreased from million in to million in the decrease is due in part to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program that was implemented in  which collectively contributed approximately million in unfavorable net adjustments in  compared to million in favorable adjustments in  as well as a decrease in in commission income of million related to our pls joint venture 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in  our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by recording a valuation allowance charge of million against our us deferred tax assets 
this charge is comprised of an initial charge of million in the second quarter and additional adjustments over the remainder of  of million 
this charge was primarily due to the fact that in  we were in a significant three year cumulative loss position in the us also  in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
we are eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years 
in  the fifth year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a negligible decrease in our effective tax rate 
in  the fourth year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate based upon rsh s pretax income of million 
in  rsh was subject to a rate of tax of  which resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate based upon their pretax income of million 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in the fourth quarter of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the high performance foams reportable segment  as backlog for the polyurethane and silicone foam business  primarily sold into the portable communications  mass transit and consumer electronics markets  combined with the effect of the acquisition of certain assets of mti global inc increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales was primarily due to a decrease in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in and in the printed circuit materials reportable segment of million  or  from million to million  partially offset by an increase in sales in our high performance foams reportable segment of million  or  from million to million 
the factors resulting in these changes in sales are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased approximately basis points to in from in margins increased at our three strategic segments high performance foams  printed circuit materials and custom electrical components due in part to our focus on cost containment measures as well as gaining operational efficiencies in anticipation of the volume declines that occurred at the end of also  in  we recognized certain charges relating to our restructuring activities that included recognizing reserves on certain inventories at our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments that negatively impacted our margins in a portion of this inventory reserved in was sold in  which positively impacted our margins in by approximately basis points 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the results included approximately million in charges related to the settlement of and legal fees for our lawsuit with calamp see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion  as well as incentive compensation expense of approximately million 
these charges were partially offset by the cost containment initiatives and operating efficiency measures that were implemented during the year 
the expense included approximately million of charges related to restructuring activities that were initiated in the second quarter of related to our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments 
overall selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses remained consistent at in both and our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges were million in  while there were no such charges in the charges in related primarily to our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments 
the charges consisted of i accelerated depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and contracts million  ii an increase in inventory reserves million  iii severance costs related to a company wide headcount reduction million  and iv the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials operating segment million 
for income statement presentation purposes  approximately million of these charges are included in cost of sales  million are included in selling and administrative expenses and million are included in restructuring and impairment charges 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows durel in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our durel operating segment  which is aggregated into our custom electrical components reportable segment 
this charge included a million restructuring charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the durel business and a million charge related to the accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with a certain flexible electroluminescent el lamp product 
these charges were partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of these charges resulted from a significant change in the current outlook for existing and future el lamp programs during the second quarter of based on information related to certain program terminations from our most significant customer of el lamps in the portable communications market 
as a result of this change in business conditions  all remaining production of el lamps for the portable communications market that was located at durel s manufacturing facility in arizona was shifted to china by the end of the second quarter of as of year end  substantially all el production  including lamps for the automotive industry  shifted to our china facility 
the significant change in the outlook of el programs and the planned shift in el production to china was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of the durel business 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process  led us to conclude that no impairment charge associated with the durel long lived assets was necessary 
as such  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of el lamp related equipment in durel s us manufacturing facility 
in addition  the reduced forecast of el lamp sales  specifically related to flexible el lamps for the portable communications market  caused us to accelerate the expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with flexible el lamps based on the current forecasted revenues 
we incurred charges of approximately million in related to these restructuring activities and sold approximately million of previously reserved inventory 
flexible circuit materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our flexible circuit materials operating segment  which was aggregated into our printed circuit materials reportable segment 
this charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the flexible circuit materials business and was partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of flexible circuit materials  which are used in a variety of consumer electronic products  had become a commodity product with increased global competition and pricing pressure driven by excess capacity 
this commoditization caused the operating results of the flexible circuit materials business to significantly decline in recent periods  which resulted in our revaluation of the strategic future viability of this business 
we determined that these market factors were an indicator of impairment that triggered an analysis of the long lived assets related to the flexible circuit materials business 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process  concluded that no impairment charge associated with the flexible circuit materials long lived assets was necessary 
as such  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of the equipment related to the flexible circuit materials operating segment 
we also determined  based on business conditions at that time that certain inventories associated with this business would not be saleable  and we reserved for these inventories accordingly 
we incurred minimal charges in related to these restructuring activities and sold approximately million of previously reserved inventory 
composite materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment  which is aggregated into our other polymer products reportable segment 
the operating results of the composite materials business had gradually declined over the past few years 
during the second quarter of  a government program  which was material to the sales and earnings of the composite materials business  expired 
we determined that the loss of this program  which we had previously thought would be replaced with new business  was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenues of this business 
consequently  we performed an impairment analysis on the composite materials operating segment 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process  resulted in us recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the business other long lived assets 
no additional charges related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment were recorded during the remainder of severance in  as part of the restructuring activities previously discussed  we took a number of actions to reduce costs  including a company wide headcount reduction 
this resulted in million of severance charges recorded in in addition  we made severance payments of million in and the remaining million was paid in equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in joint venture sales were down across all businesses  which were primarily related to customers managing inventories caused by the softening in consumer demand 
most impacted were our polyurethane foam joint ventures with inoac corporation in japan and china  which experienced weakened demand  particularly in the gaming console and cell phone markets 
other income other income increased from million in to million in the increase was due in part to our foreign currency hedging program that was implemented in  which contributed approximately million in favorable foreign currency adjustments in  as well as an increase in commission income related to our pls joint venture million and the inclusion of certain one time charges associated with adjusting our legal entity structure in china that negatively impacted results  as well as certain other one time charges  that did not occur in income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity and general business tax credits 
we are eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years 
in  the fourth year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate 
in  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of and which resulted in a decrease to our effective tax rate of 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate based upon their pretax income of million 
in  rsh reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of and which resulted in a decrease to our effective tax rate of 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease at the end of was primarily related to the decrease in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for electroluminescent lamps and inverters  primarily sold to manufacturers of portable communications equipment and automobiles  decreased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end segment sales and operations printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our printed circuit materials pcm reportable segment is comprised of high frequency circuit material products 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to and by in as compared to in  the decline in sales was partially driven by the economic recession  although not to the same extent as some of our other businesses 
this segment was also impacted by the overall worldwide softness in the wireless infrastructure market and delays in spending on third generation program awards in china 
these declines were partially offset by strong demand for high frequency materials into the satellite television market for low noise block down converters lnbs in china  with moderate demand in the us and europe 
additionally  sales into the defense and high reliability markets were up modestly  particularly in the second half of the year 
from an operating results perspective  included approximately million of costs related to the impairment of certain equipment  million related to additional inventory reserves  million related to a product liability claim and severance charges of million 
results included charges of approximately million related to the settlement of and legal fees for our lawsuit with calamp 
from to  the decline in sales was due primarily to the reduced sales volumes of flexible circuit material products  which has effectively been eliminated from our product portfolio as the market became commoditized over the past few years 
results also included approximately million for settlement costs and legal fees related to the calamp litigation 
results included one time charges of approximately million of net restructuring charges related to accelerated depreciation on certain equipment used to manufacture flexible circuit materials in the us  an increase in inventory reserves  and severance costs 
high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income our high performance foams hpf reportable segment is comprised of poron urethane and bisco silicone foam products 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to and increased by approximately in as compared to in  hpf was impacted significantly by the recession  particularly in the first half of the year  as weakened consumer spending and supply chain inventory issues negatively impacted revenues across all end markets 
cell phone applications in particular experienced significant declines as manufacturers had excess inventory in the supply chain 
however  as the year progressed  sales into the portable handset applications and consumer electronics market  improved as the supply chain inventory corrections were completed and order rates increased 
in the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of certain assets of the silicone foam business of mti global  inc  which was accretive to our sales volumes over the second half of the year 
in the second half of  we experienced sales volume increases as compared to the first half of the year  particularly in cell phone and consumer electronics markets 
additionally  orders improved for our silicone foam materials into the mass transit and general industrial markets  in part due to the acquisition of certain mti global  inc assets 
results include approximately million of one time integration costs related to this purchase  as well as million in severance charges related to both the acquisition  as well as the worldwide workforce reduction announced in the first half of the year 
at the end of  the integration of the assets of mti global  inc was substantially complete 
in as compared to  sales and operating profits both increased year over year  as the segment experienced growth driven by strong demand in the portable communications and transportation markets 
in  we added a second urethane foam manufacturing line in our suzhou  china campus under the management of our ris joint venture in order to better meet customer demand in the asian marketplace 
however  as came to a close  sales across all markets declined as the global economic crisis and associated decline in consumer spending began to impact the business 
custom electrical components dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our custom electrical components cec reportable segment is comprised of electroluminescent lamps  inverters  and power distribution systems products 
net sales in this segment have decreased significantly since as the segment experienced a decline of approximately in as compared to and approximately in as compared to  while operating results continued to produce losses across all three years 
the consistent decline in sales is directly attributable to the reduction in demand for el backlighting in the portable communications market 
these declines have been partially offset by sales of power distribution systems products into the mass transit market  as well as into sustainable energy markets  particularly for wind turbine applications  where demand continues to grow as more countries focus on alternative clean energy sources 
results included million of asset impairment charges related to the write down of certain equipment and buildings  million of incremental inventory reserves  and severance charges of approximately million related to our global workforce reduction in early also  results included a net restructuring charge of million  which was comprised of increased inventory reserves  accelerated depreciation related to idle equipment in the us  accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with certain el lamp product sales  and severance costs 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
we are currently exploring other potential opportunities for our el technology  particularly in the consumer electronics markets  among others 
other polymer products dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our other polymer products opp reportable segment consists of the following products elastomer rollers  floats  non woven materials  flexible circuit materials resale from rcct and thermal management products 
net sales decreased in as compared to by and increased from to by approximately 
the declines in are primarily attributable to sales volume decreases of our elastomer rollers and float products due mostly to the global recession and increased competition in asia 
also contributing to the declines  particularly in operating results  were costs associated with our thermal management products  which is still in its start up phase and has yet to generate material sales volumes 
from an operating results standpoint  results included approximately million in asset impairment charges related to equipment and buildings and severance charges of million 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
the increase in sales in as compared to was primarily due to the inclusion of a new operating segment in this reportable segment 
in  as previously disclosed  we restructured our flexible circuit materials operating segment and outsourced the majority of the manufacturing of these products to our joint venture  rcct 
as part of this restructuring  we agreed to distribute the products now produced by rcct  the related sales for which are included in this segment 
also as previously disclosed  we sold our induflex operating segment  which was previously reported in this reportable segment but is now reported as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 
the segment s operating results declined in as compared to primarily due to the start up costs associated with our thermal management systems operating segment  as well as losses associated with the new flexible circuit materials distribution segment mentioned above 
in  this segment s results included approximately million in restructuring charges related to the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials business 
also in  we formally divested our polyolefin foam operation  which is now classified as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes and is not included in the results presented here 
we continuously evaluate the viability of the product portfolio in this segment as it relates to our long term strategic and operational focus 
joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  our joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales decreased from to following an increase of from to the increase experienced in and early in was primarily driven by new lcd gasket design wins in portable communications and electronic games for the domestic japanese market 
however  sales volumes declined at the end of and through due to softening demand  primarily as a result of the global recession 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris ris  our joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china  began operations in sales decreased from to  following a similar decrease  from to the decline in sales for is a result of the global recession and excess inventory in the supply chain  particularly in the first half of sales levels improved in the third and fourth quarters of due primarily to the improvement in the chinese economy 
rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  our joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit materials for customers in taiwan 
sales decreased from to and from to the decreases experienced in and were primarily driven by the overall global decline in the flexible circuit materials market 
polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  our joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sells adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
sales declined from to and increased by in as compared to the increase in was due to strong demand in the first half of the year in the personal computer market  however demand declined significantly by the end of and into  primarily as a result of the global recession which led to the sales decline and excess inventories at our primary customer 
discontinued operations on october   we closed on an agreement to sell the shares of our induflex subsidiary to bv capital partners 
under the terms of the agreement  rogers received approximately million euros us million at the october  spot price  which represented the purchase price of approximately million euros plus other amounts due under the agreement 
in addition to this purchase price  there is an opportunity for rogers to receive additional earnout amounts for three years from the date of the sale based on the future performance of the divested business 
this subsidiary had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
net income of million and million have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the net gain reflected as discontinued operations at december  includes a million gain related to the sale of induflex 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the tax related to the discontinued operations was million and million of tax expense for december  and december   respectively 
there was no effect to operating results in  as a result of this discontinued operation 
on july   we completed the closure of the operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment  which had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
for the fiscal year ended  million of net income has been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million for in the third quarter of  we ceased operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment and there were no net sales associated with the discontinued operations for the second half of see note discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our businesses by developing cost effective solutions that enable or improve the performance of customers products 
research and development as a percentage of sales was approximately in as compared to in and in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development  and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to expand product offerings based on existing platforms  improving existing products and developing new platforms 
we introduced a variety of new products during for example  our high performance foams business  we introduced a poron product that enables sports equipment and protective gear makers to improve impact protection  and also new grades of thin  highly compressible dust seal materials to better protect cell phone displays 
in our custom electrical components business  we introduced an integrated circuit that drives piezoelectric devices to enable tactile feedback on touchscreens and a product that combines polymer dispersed light shutter technology with electroluminescent lighting to enable reconfigurable keypads that are visible under a wide range of lighting conditions 
in our printed circuit materials business  we introduced two new products for cell phone base station antennas  a product that allows the size of power amplifiers to be reduced and a family of environmentally friendly halogen free circuit materials for wired broadband communications infrastructure 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by our financial position remaining strong throughout in a year of declining sales 
we have remained debt free since and continue to finance our operational needs through internally generated funds 
we believe that over the next twelve months  our cash position and internally generated funds during the year will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditures and ongoing financial needs of our business 
in addition  we continue to have access to a substantial line of credit should any unforeseen need impact the business 
we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our lending facilities and banking relationships 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at december   december  and december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively  and working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in significant items that impacted operating cash flows included the following a decrease in inventories of million in as compared to million in and million in the continuing decline from to is the result of the sales declines in the customer electrical components and printed circuit materials reportable segments  as well as a focused effort to reduce inventory levels to improve cash flows and strengthen our working capital position as sales declined significantly late in and through the first half of an increase in accounts receivable of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in the increase in  versus the decrease in and  is primarily due to increased sales volumes in the second half of  even though collections remained strong 
a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and million in the decline in is primarily due to the payout in of the annual incentive compensation plan and the payout of million related to the settlement of the calamp lawsuit 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in raw material purchases related to the decreased production levels which is further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable periods as discussed above  driven by our efforts to maintain cash flows in the face of lower sales in a declining economy 
contributing to the decline in is the payout in of the annual incentive compensation plan and the payout of million related to the settlement of the calamp lawsuit 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million in and million in in we used approximately million of cash for the acquisition of certain assets of the mti global  inc business and for a million investment in solicore 
additionally  had lower cash used in investing activities because of million of cash received related to the sale of the induflex business 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the higher capital spending was driven by our continued investment in manufacturing capacity in suzhou  china 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to cash used by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the use of cash in and was driven primarily by our stock repurchase program  as million and million were spent to reacquire stock in and  respectively 
we did not repurchase any stock in credit facilities we have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement with rbs citizens  national association bank  a successor in interest to citizens bank of connecticut credit agreement 
on november   we entered into amendment no 
amendment to this credit agreement 
pursuant to this amendment  the total facility under the credit agreement was reduced from million to million  by eliminating the previously existing million credit facility and reducing the previously existing million credit facility to million 
the current million credit facility credit facility is available for loans or letters of credit 
it is a multi currency facility under which we may borrow in us dollars  japanese yen  euros or any other currency freely convertible into us dollars and traded on a recognized interbank market 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we have the right to incur additional indebtedness outside of the credit agreement through additional borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit facility expires on november  the rate of interest charged on any outstanding loans can  at our option and subject to certain restrictions  be based on the prime rate or at a rate basis points over libor 
under the arrangement  the ongoing commitment fee is basis points of the maximum amount that can be borrowed  net of any outstanding borrowings and the maximum amount that beneficiaries may draw under outstanding letters of credit 
there were no borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants primarily related to total indebtedness  interest expense  and capital expenditures 
the amendment modifies the definition of ebitda contained in the credit agreement by adding back into earnings non cash stock compensation charges and certain asset impairment charges  thereby relieving certain restraints on our ability to borrow 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  and december  at december  we had the following standby letters of credit loc and guarantees that were backed by the credit facility million irrevocable standby loc to guarantee rogers self insured workers compensation plan million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers shanghai no amounts were owed on the locs as of december  and december   respectively 
the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions 
however  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months 
financial position the following discusses the significant fluctuations on our balance sheet at december  as compared to december  decrease in inventories of is the result of our efforts to reduce inventory levels in order to strengthen our working capital position and better align our inventory levels with our expected sales levels 
increase in accounts receivable of is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of as compared to the significant decline in sales in the fourth quarter of  offset by our concentrated collection efforts in order to strengthen our cash and working capital position 
decrease in accrued employee benefits and compensation of is a result of the annual incentive compensation and commission payouts for  which were not earned in as a result of the poor results of the business 
decrease in accounts payable of is primarily attributable to the decrease in raw material purchases to support current production levels as further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable period as discussed above  as well as the timing of payments at year end 
increase in additional paid in capital of is primarily related to equity compensation combined with stock option exercises 
auction rate securities as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities at par value as compared to approximately million as of december  at the end of  these securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value based on market valuations at that time level input in accordance with accounting guidance 
however  in the first quarter of  the markets in which these securities traded became illiquid  causing us to reclassify these securities from a level input to a level input  as an active market no longer existed for these securities  and therefore we had to base our valuations on unobservable inputs 
accordingly  our asset value was determined considering several factors  including an estimated time horizon for redeeming such securities  a discount factor to determine the present value of such securities  as well as the quality of the underlying securities  most of which were backed by investment grade student loans or municipalities 
our initial valuations utilized a discount period of approximately two years  which represented our best estimates of the time period over which these securities would be redeemed 
however  as progressed  we determined that  based on the market conditions at the time that the estimated time horizon for redemption of such securities would be greater than two years and  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our assumptions for this consideration 
the total fair value of the auction rate securities at december   was million 
these securities are classified as long term assets  except for those that are scheduled to be redeemed within the next three months  which are classified as short term investments 
the impairment described above  as of year end  is classified as an other than temporary loss  separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in earnings  and as long as we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  the remaining amount is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the amount recognized in earnings as of december  was million 
the assumptions utilized in the valuation will continue to be reviewed and  as market conditions continue to evolve and change  we will adjust our assumptions accordingly  which could result in either positive or negative valuation adjustments in the future 
currently  we believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery 
we also do not believe that the illiquid nature of these securities will negatively impact our business  as we believe we have the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund the operations and future growth of the business absent these securities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years operating leases capital commitments pension and retiree health and life insurance benefits total pension benefit payments  which amount to million  are expected to be paid through the utilization of pension plan assets  retiree health and life insurance benefits  which amount to million  are expected to be paid from operating cash flows 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are in the opinion of management reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting standards effective date for subject date issued summary effect of adoption rogers consolidation of variable interest entities june requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this standard also requires an ongoing reassessment of the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
currently assessing the potential effects of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
january  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believe that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances that are known  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows environmental and product liabilities we accrue for our environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prp s  we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
we are exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
in late  we determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine our potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  our limited claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  we believe that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  we also believe that our ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required us to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
we believe the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of our asbestos litigation 
we believe  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to us  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify our liability is five years  resulting in a liability at december  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if we were to adjust our assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from five years to seven years would be an increase to the liability of million  which we believe would be substantially covered by insurance  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from five years to three years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  we plan to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and we will update them if needed based on our experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that our accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate our actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that our accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional charges for our asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot estimate such excess amounts at this time 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
it is our policy that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
we provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture as well as our taiwanese flexible circuit materials joint venture 
inventory allowances we maintain a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on our estimates  and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
we closely monitor the market place and related inventory levels and have historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  we value certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
our obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a basis point adjustment to the december  obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill our goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
determining the fair value of an operating segment is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of on the two operating segments for which we had goodwill recorded at that time and it did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for these operating segments ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each operating segment  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
these valuations are based on a five year discounted cash flow analysis  which utilized a discount rate of approximately and a terminal year growth rate of 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in  we recorded impairment charges related to certain long lived assets in our printed circuit materials  custom electrical components and high performance foams reportable segments 
see the results of operations section of item of this form k  for further discussion 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide various defined benefit pension plans for our us employees and sponsor three defined benefit healthcare plans and a life insurance plan 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the citigroup index and  to a lesser extent  the moody s aa bond index  ii the salary growth is based on our historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  market conditions and our expectations of future returns 
the rates used to determine our costs and obligations under our pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our net benefit cost by approximately million and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when we are made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on our estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of our customer base 
the risk with this estimate is associated with failure to become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  our estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and we have processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues  additionally  we have credit insurance which mitigates some of the risk of loss 
historically over the past three years  our allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in our current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase our allowance reserve by approximately million 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility in determining expected volatility  we have considered a number of factors  including historical volatility and implied volatility 
expected term we use historical employee exercise data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes valuation 
risk free interest rate we use the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period commensurate with the expected term assumption as its risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield we currently do not pay dividends on our common stock  therefore  a dividend yield of was used in the black scholes model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of december  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
forward looking information certain statements in this annual report on form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are based on management s expectations  estimates  projections and assumptions 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  changing business  economic  and political conditions both in the united states and in foreign countries  increasing competition  changes in product mix  the development of new products and manufacturing processes and the inherent risks associated with such efforts  the outcome of current and future litigation  the accuracy of our analysis of our potential asbestos related exposure and insurance coverage  changes in the availability and cost of raw materials  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and any difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our operations 
such factors also apply to our joint ventures 
we make no commitment to update any forward looking statement or to disclose any facts  events  or circumstances after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statements  unless required by law 
additional information about certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those items described in item a to this form k  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk currently  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risks and manage such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
we have various borrowing facilities where the interest rates  although not fixed  are currently relatively low 
currently  an increase in the associated interest rates would not significantly impact interest expense on these facilities  as we currently have no debt 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and nature of our investment portfolio 
at the beginning of our short term investments were comprised of auction rate securities 
these investments had been classified as available for sale due to the short term nature of the investments however  during the first quarter of we reclassified them to long term 
changes in market conditions caused us to change the nature of these investments and record an impairment during the first quarter of and each subsequent quarter through at year end this impairment is classified as an other than temporary loss  separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in earnings  and as long as we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  the remaining amount is recorded in other comprehensive income 
due to the company s current liquidity and intent to hold the investments until they recover  the amount of the impairment not related to credit loss is recorded in other comprehensive income 
our financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we do business 
our primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
we can initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively
