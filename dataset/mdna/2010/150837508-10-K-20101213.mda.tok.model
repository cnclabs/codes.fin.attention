item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
cel sci s most advanced product  multikine  which is cleared for a phase iii clinical trial in the us and in canada  is being developed for the treatment of cancer 
cel sci also owns a pre clinical technology called leaps ligand epitope antigen presentation system 
all of cel sci s projects are under development 
as a result  cel sci cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
since inception  cel sci has financed its operations through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes  loans and certain research grants 
cel sci s expenses will likely exceed its revenues as it continues the development of multikine and brings other drug candidates into clinical trials 
until such time as cel sci becomes profitable  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist cel sci s capital requirements 
results of operations fiscal during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to continuing expenses relating to the preparation for the phase iii clinical trial on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september   primarily due to legal fees caused by the iroquois lawsuit 
interest income during the year ended september  increased by  compared to the year ended september  the increase was due to the greater amount of capital cel sci had for investment in money market funds 
the gain on derivative instruments of  for the year ended september   was the result of the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities on the balance sheet 
the series a e warrants issued in conjunction with several financings during the fiscal year ended september   as well as others are considered derivative liabilities and must be valued at the end of each period 
the fluctuation of the price of cel sci s common stock is a major cause of derivative gains or losses 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was interest on the related party loan 
previous years included amortization of the series k discount and the premium on the related party loan 
fiscal during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to continuing expenses relating to the preparation for the phase iii clinical trial on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september   primarily because of an increase in the codification share based payment costs of approximately  the codification share based payment cost is a non cash charge 
this increase was primarily offset by a reduction in travel costs  shareholder costs  and presentation costs 
interest income during the year ended september  decreased by  compared to the year ended september  the decrease was due to lower interest rates and a decline in the funds available to invest  until the later part of the year 
the loss on derivative instruments of  for the year ended september   was the result of the change in fair value of the series a e warrants as well as the series k notes and series k warrants during the period 
the series a e warrants issued in conjunction with several financings are considered derivative liabilities and must be valued at the end of each period 
the fair value of these warrants was calculated to be  at september  in addition  the remaining series k warrants were valued at  at september  this loss was due to three factors an increase in the company s share price  and the repricing of the series k notes to as a result of the june financing  and the resulting increase in the number of shares and warrants owned by the series k investors 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was composed of five elements amortization of the series k discount and short term loan discount  interest paid and accrued on the series k debt  other interest  interest on the short term loan  and net of amortization of loan premium  this represents a decrease of  from the year ended september  due to the cost of the warrants issued to the short term note holder  a noncash cost 
the corresponding amounts for the year ended september  are     and research and development expenses during the five years ended september  cel sci s research and development efforts involved multikine and leaps 
the table below shows the research and development expenses associated with each project during this five year period 
multikine      leaps   total     in january  fda gave the go ahead for the phase iii clinical trial which had earlier been cleared by the canadian regulatory agency  the biologics and genetic therapies directorate 
as explained in item of this report  as of september   cel sci was involved in a number of pre clinical studies with respect to its leaps technology 
as with multikine  cel sci does not know what obstacles it will encounter in future pre clinical and clinical studies involving its leaps technology 
consequently  cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials and the timing of future research and development projects 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
liquidity and capital resources cel sci has had only limited revenues from operations since its inception in march l cel sci has relied primarily upon proceeds realized from the public and private sale of its common and preferred stock and convertible notes to meet its funding requirements 
funds raised by cel sci have been expended primarily in connection with the acquisition of an exclusive worldwide license to  and later purchase of  certain patented and unpatented proprietary technology and know how relating to the human immunological defense system  patent applications  the repayment of debt  the continuation of research and development sponsored by cel sci  administrative costs and construction of laboratory facilities 
inasmuch as cel sci does not anticipate realizing revenues until such time as it enters into licensing arrangements regarding the technology and know how licensed to it which could take a number of years  cel sci is mostly dependent upon the proceeds from the sale of its securities to meet all of its liquidity and capital resource requirements 
in august  cel sci leased a building near baltimore  maryland 
the building  which consists of approximately  square feet  has been remodeled in accordance with cel sci s specifications so that it can be used by cel sci to manufacture multikine for cel sci s phase iii clinical trials and sales of the drug if approved by the fda 
the lease expires on october   and requires annual base rent payments of approximately  during the twelve months ending october  see item of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease 
in august  cel sci sold series k convertible notes  plus series k warrants  to independent private investors for  the notes were convertible into shares of cel sci s common stock 
on august   all of the series k notes had either been repaid or had been converted into shares of cel sci s common stock 
as of november    series k warrants had been exercised 
the remaining series k warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to february  if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below the  the warrant exercise price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
one of the series k note holders  iroquois master fund ltd  has indicated that it believes the conversion price of the series k notes  as well as the exercise price of the series k warrants  should be as opposed to 
it is cel sci s position that the correct conversion price was and the correct exercise price of the warrants is 
on october   iroquois filed suit against cel sci 
in its complaint  alleging breach of contract  breach of fiduciary duty  conversion  and negligence  iroquois seeks actual and punitive damages  the issuance by cel sci of additional shares and warrants  and a ruling by the court that the conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrants are both

between december and june  maximilian de clara  cel sci s president and a director  loaned cel sci  the loan was initially payable at the end of march  but was extended to the end of june at the time the loan was due  and in accordance with the loan agreement  cel sci issued mr 
de clara a warrant which entitles mr 
de clara to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable at any time prior to december  although the loan was to be repaid from the proceeds of cel sci s recent financing  cel sci s directors deemed it beneficial not to repay the loan and negotiated a second extension of the loan with mr 
de clara on terms similar to the june financing 
pursuant to the terms of the second extension the note is now due on july   but  at mr 
de clara s option  the loan can be converted into shares of cel sci s common stock 
the number of shares which will be issued upon any conversion will be determined by dividing the amount to be converted by 
as further consideration for the second extension  mr 
de clara received warrants which allow mr 
de clara to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to january  the loan from mr 
de clara bears interest at per year and is secured by a lien on substantially all of cel sci s assets 
cel sci does not have the right to prepay the loan without mr 
de clara s consent 
between july  and march   cel sci received approximately  from the exercise of stock options and other warrants including a number of cel sci s series a  j  k and l warrants previously issued to private investors 
inventory has increased significantly in the fiscal year ended september  cel sci has been purchasing supplies for the manufacturing of multikine in order to begin the phase iii trial 
in addition  prepaids have increased with the purchase of insurance for the phase iii trials 
future capital requirements other than funding operating losses  funding its research and development program  and paying its liabilities  cel sci does not have any material capital commitments 
material future liabilities as of september  are as follows contractual obligations 
del years ending september  total thereafter operating leases  employment contracts     del 
for additional information on employment contracts  see item of this report 
in addition  cel sci has an additional contract with a consultant for a nine month period ending in fiscal year this contract totals approximately  further  cel sci has contingent obligations with vendors for work that will be completed in relation to the phase iii trial 
the timing of these obligations cannot be determined at this time 
the amount of these obligations for the phase iii trial is approximately million with the net cost to cel sci being between million 
cel sci believes that its capital will allow it to enroll the patients in the phase iii clinical trial 
cel sci will need to raise additional funds  either through its existing warrants options  through a debt or equity financing or a partnering arrangement  to complete the phase iii trial and bring multikine to market 
cel sci management believes that all of the above will be much easier than it used to be in the past since cel sci will be involved in a very large phase iii clinical trial for an unmet medical need and should therefore be more attractive as an investment 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
in the absence of revenues  cel sci will be required to raise additional funds through the sale of securities  debt financing or other arrangements in order to continue with its research efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or be available on favorable terms 
ultimately  cel sci must complete the development of its products  obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials  the timing of future research and development projects  or when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
cel sci s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its certificates of deposit  and  to an immaterial extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies cel sci s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this report 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by management 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on cel sci s historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
cel sci s significant accounting policies include patents patent expenditures are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
in the event changes in technology or other circumstances impair the value or life of the patent  appropriate adjustment in the asset value and period of amortization is made 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and from disposition  is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
stock options and warrants codification requires companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model 
codification applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employees 
using the modified prospective transition method of adoption  cel sci reflected compensation expense in its financial statements beginning october  the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods to reflect the impact of codification as such  compensation expense is recognized for awards that were granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after october  options to non employees are accounted for in accordance with codification s accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  compensation is recognized when goods or services are received and is measured using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires cel sci s management to make assumptions regarding the fair value of the options at the date of grant and the expected life of the options 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments cel sci reviews its fixed assets  intangibles and deferred rent every fiscal quarter 
this review requires that cel sci make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  cel sci is then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
cel sci believes that it has made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether its long lived assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in its determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  cel sci could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of the reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
prepaid expenses and inventory inventory consists of bulk purchases of laboratory supplies used on a daily basis in the lab and items that will be used for future production 
the items in inventory are expensed when used in production or daily activity as research and development expenses 
these items are disposables and consumables and can be used for both the manufacturing of multikine for clinical studies and in the laboratory for quality control and bioassay use 
they can be used in training  testing and daily laboratory activities 
prepaid expenses are payments for services over a long period and are expensed over the time period for which the service is rendered 
derivative instruments cel sci enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci accounts for these arrangement in accordance with codification  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  as well as related interpretations of these standards 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments 
embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings if they can be reliably measured 
when the fair value of embedded derivative features cannot be reliably measured  cel sci measures and reports the entire hybrid instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings 
cel sci determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models  giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument and precluding the use of blockage discounts or premiums in determining the fair value of a large block of financial instruments 
fair value under these conditions does not necessarily represent fair value determined using valuation standards that give consideration to blockage discounts and other factors that may be considered by market participants in establishing fair value 
accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued codification  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which changes disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for periods ending on or after november   with early application encouraged 
cel sci has adopted this statement with no effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb finalized codification  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the eitf lays out a procedure to determine if the debt instrument is indexed to its own common stock 
the eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  cel sci has adopted this codification and reviewed all outstanding options and warrants as of october  see note in the financial statements included as part of this report for a discussion 
in september  the fasb staff issued codification a  disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees an amendment of fasb statement no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 and clarification of the effective date of fasb statement no 

the codification applies to credit derivatives within the scope of statement and hybrid instruments that have embedded credit derivatives 
it deals with disclosures related to these derivatives and is effective for reporting periods ending after november  it also clarifies the effective date of codification as any reporting period beginning after november  cel sci has adopted this codification and it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued codification  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the codification amends fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair values of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair values of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
the codification also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
this codification topic became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  cel sci adopted this codification in the quarter ended june  there was no significant impact from this adoption on cel sci s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued codification  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
the codification establishes the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the codification became effective for cel sci for the period ended june  and is to be applied prospectively 
the impact of the adoption was not significant 
in january  the fasb amended codification  improving disclosures about fair value measurement  effective for interim periods beginning after december  this amendment changes disclosures required for interim and annual periods with respect to fair value measurements 
cel sci has adopted the change in the disclosure requirements and the effect was immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
cel sci enters into financing arrangements that are or include freestanding derivative instruments or that are  or include  hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments is affected primarily by volatility of the trading prices of the cel sci s common stock 
for three years ended september   cel sci recognized a gain or loss of   and  respectively  resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
cel sci has no exposure to risks associated with foreign exchange rate changes because none of the operations of cel sci are transacted in a foreign currency 
the interest risk on investments on september  was considered immaterial due to the fact that the interest rates at that time were nominal at best and cel sci keeps its cash and cash equivalents in short term maturities
