table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in item of this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
this discussion addresses primarily our continuing operations  except in the discussion under the heading discontinued operations 
for more information on our discontinued operations  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview mantech is a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  the departments of defense  state  homeland security and justice  and other us federal government customers 
our expertise includes systems engineering  systems integration  enterprise architecture  cyber security  information assurance  intelligent operations and analysis support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information operations and information warfare support  information technology  communications integration  global logistics and supply chain management and service oriented architectures 
our commitment to customer mission is one of our key differentiators 
we currently operate in approximately countries worldwide  and approximately  of our  highly qualified employees are deployed supporting us forces in theater 
we derive revenues primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security  and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence  homeland security and other federal agencies 
related to the evolving terrorist threats and world events  the us government has continued to increase its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
our revenues increased mainly as a result of our cyber security business and progress supporting computer network operations  efforts involving isr systems and telecommunications infrastructure  maintenance and repair  the expansion of our sustainment and countermine support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  our work with intelligence agencies  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past three years 
for the years ended december   and  over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps  and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including nasa and pto  as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows revenues from each type of customer as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies  international agencies and commercial entities total revenues 
table of contents we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
years ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price total revenues time and materials contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from contracts directly with the us government or as a subcontractor to other providers of services to the us government 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenues for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenues subcontract revenues total revenues 
table of contents our prime contract revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased from to largely due to our sole source prime contract award in to continue and expand our support for the route clearance family of contract and mrap vehicles and growth in cyber security efforts 
our prime contract revenues as a percentage of our total revenues decreased from to as customers increased the purchase of goods and services through larger  more consolidated contract vehicles 
revenues substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees  our subcontractors and through solutions that include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants and third party materials  including hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenues to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party materials 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are facilities  corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance and executive and senior management 
in addition  we included stock based compensation  as well as depreciation and amortization expense of million related to the general and administrative function for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships and contract backlogs acquired in business combinations  and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings and notes payable  deferred financing charges and interest on capital leases 
interest income interest income is primarily from cash on hand and notes receivable 

table of contents results of operations recent event on january   we completed the acquisition of sensor technologies inc sti for million in cash 
we utilized a combination of cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility to finance the acquisition 
sti is a leading provider of mission critical systems engineering and command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr services and solutions to the department of defense 
sti s largest contract is the strategic services sourcing s indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract with the us army 
in  sti produced revenues of million 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenues as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars in thousands revenues cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our contracts supporting forward deployments in iraq  afghanistan and other areas around the world and our acquisitions of emerging technologies group  inc etg in august  ewa services  inc ewa in november and ddk in march revenue growth of million came from contracts for the installation  sustainment and repair of communication systems and heavily armored vehicles designed to counter or clear mines and ieds  such as the route clearance family of vehicles supporting us army tank automotive command tacom 
significant cyber security contracts contributed revenue growth of million  including million from contracts transferred through the acquisitions of etg and ddk 
the acquisition of ewa contributed a revenue increase of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in certain space related work and other 
we are expecting the growth in revenues to continue in as a result of our continued expansion in the areas of cyber security  isr systems infrastructure maintenance and repair  and global logistics  supply chain management as well as the acquisition of sti in january while we believe there will be continued growth 
table of contents in our global logistics and supply chain management contracts  we recognize the uncertainty in the us mission and priority of funding for combat operations in iraq and afghanistan 
the continued growth in our cyber security contracts is expected as a result of the government s comprehensive national cyber initiative funding 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to direct labor  which includes applicable fringe benefits and overhead related to our ied and cyber security contracts and our recent acquisitions of ewa and ddk 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services decreased to for the year as compared to for the same period in direct labor costs increased by over the period in primarily due to growth in staff supporting global logistics and supply chain management and acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in other direct costs  which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts  increased by over the same period in the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in purchases of equipment and materials on our contracts for installation and repair of systems designed to counter or clear mines and ieds 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs decreased by from for the year ended december  to for the same period in the decrease of other direct costs as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to the ied programs gradual transition of materials procurement to the government procurement offices 
we expect cost of services to increase in fiscal year consistent with the expected growth in revenue noted above 
furthermore  we expect the relative mix of other direct costs compared to direct labor costs to increase for fiscal year due to increased use of subcontractors resulting from the acquisition of sti in january general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of revenues was due to systems and staff requirements needed to support increased demands for materials and services  business development and system improvements costs 
we have increased expense for internal compliance monitoring and process improvement costs due to the current trend of amplified government regulation and review 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease in as a result of the completion of certain systems improvement and compliance initiatives and leveraging our internal administrative support and management function with higher revenues 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in our average outstanding debt balance 
our average outstanding debt balance for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest rate we incur on our credit facility is impacted by changes in the federal funds rate or london interbank offer rate libor 
changes in these lending rates could lead to fluctuations in our interest expense in future periods 
for additional information see credit agreement below 
we expect interest expense to increase significantly in due to borrowings under our credit agreement to finance the acquisition of sti in january interest income interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the fluctuation is due to a reduction in the interest rate related to our cash accounts for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in 
table of contents provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from december  was largely due to the impact of deductible gains related to our employee supplemental savings plan 
net income net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is a result of higher revenues and improved margins primarily driven by increased demand for direct labor projects 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent in thousands revenues cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes gain on sale of discontinued operation  net of taxes sold to ceo net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our contracts supporting forward deployments in iraq  afghanistan and other areas around the world and our acquisitions of srs technologies srs in may  mcdonald bradley  inc mbi in december  emerging technologies group  usa

for the year ending december   our acquisitions of srs  mbi  etg and ewa contributed revenue increases of million 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to larger purchases of equipment  materials and other direct costs directly related to our contracts and our acquisitions of srs  mbi  etg and ewa 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased by million primarily due to the acquisitions and growth in staff supporting global logistics and supply chain management 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decrease in direct labor as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to an increase in other direct costs in relation to revenues 
other direct costs  which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts  increased by over the same period in the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in purchases of equipment and materials on our contracts for installation and repair of systems designed to counter or clear mines and ieds  as noted above  as well as our acquisitions

backlog represents estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
for additional information on how we compute backlog  see backlog in item at december   ewa and ddk contributed approximately million in backlog combined 
we expect our backlog to increase significantly in due to the acquisition of sti on january  sti backlog at december  was approximately billion of which billion was funded 
effects of inflation inflation and uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  such as conditions in the financial markets could impact our labor rates beyond the predetermined escalation factors 
however  we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by near term inflation 
purchases of equipments and materials directly for contracts are usually cost reimbursable 
in addition  inflation or inflationary concerns could prompt the federal reserve to begin increasing the federal funds rate 
as one of the borrowing rates in our credit facility is tied to the federal funds rate  increases in this rate  given similar levels of debt  could lead to higher interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are the financing of acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
on december   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was million before processing of a million payment for payroll expenditures on that same day 
at december   we had no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
at december   we were contingently liable under letters of credit totaling million  which reduces our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
the maximum available borrowings under our credit facility at december  was million 

table of contents generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our credit facility to meet cash demands 
in the future  we may borrow greater amounts under our credit facility or seek alternative borrowings to finance acquisitions or new contract start ups 
on january   we have completed the acquisition of sti for a total purchase price of million in cash 
the acquisition was funded through a combination of million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility and million in cash on hand 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations net cash flow from discontinued operations net cash flow from operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
we bill most of our clients and prime contractors monthly after services are rendered 
increased cash flow from operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the timing of the collection of customer receivables offset by the timing of vendor and other direct cost payments 
the timing and amounts of cash collections from our customers can vary significantly based primarily on the procedures requested by the us government to approve such payments

cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the use of our credit facility to support the acquisitions of srs and mbi and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in addition  we acquired treasury stock with a cost of million related to the distribution of a supplemental executive retirement plan gjp serp for our chairman and ceo for additional information see note in our consolidated financial statements 
the cash outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock was offset by the excess tax benefits generated by stock option exercises and the gjp serp transaction 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the use of our credit facility to support the acquisitions of srs and mbi and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
credit agreement on december   we amended our revolving credit agreement to allow for additional flexibility in negative covenants  and specifically to increase the allowable acquisition limitation  the amount of unsecured debt the company may have and the amount of stock that we may repurchase pursuant to a share repurchase program 
the amended credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million  of which million was committed at december  by our existing bank group

as of december   we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the credit agreement 
we believe the capital resources available to us under our credit agreement and cash from our operations are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and to support the internal growth we expect to achieve for at least the next twelve months 
we anticipate financing our external growth from acquisitions and our longer term internal growth through one or more of the following sources cash from operations  use of the existing revolving facility  a refinancing of our credit agreement  and additional borrowing or issuance of equity

for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts as described in asc  we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
accounting for business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets  financial assets and separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year 
no adjustments were necessary as a result of this review during the quarter end june  due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis
