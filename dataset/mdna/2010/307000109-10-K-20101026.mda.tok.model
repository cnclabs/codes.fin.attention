our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in the general information section of this report and the risk factors listed in part i item a of this report 
our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday closest to august of each year  which generally results in an extra week every six years 
fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were week years 
executive overview we operate a chain of more than  general merchandise retail discount stores in states  providing primarily low and middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 
our merchandise assortment includes consumables  home products  apparel and accessories  and seasonal and electronics 
we sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than to during fiscal as compared with fiscal  our net sales increased to billion  our net income increased to million  and our diluted net income per common share increased to 
comparable store sales stores open more than months for fiscal increased compared with fiscal our strong performance during fiscal was due primarily to our strong sales performance and improvements in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  both as a percentage of net sales 
over the past several years  we made investments to improve processes  build merchandising capabilities and improve the productivity of our workforce 
as a result of these investments  we are now building more compelling merchandise assortments  managing inventories more effectively and executing at the store level more consistently 
these investments have also allowed us to shift our focus to driving stronger revenue growth 
while general economic conditions may be stabilizing  we believe pressures on low and lower middle income customers continue to be significant 
we believe our strategy of providing both value and convenience positions us well to increase our market share 
during fiscal  customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comparable store sales increase  while the dollar value of the average transaction was approximately flat 
basic consumable needs continue to be the primary driver of recurring shopping trips  but we are also seeing improvement in certain discretionary categories 
for example  during fiscal  we experienced strong sales in the seasonal and electronics category as a result of our increased focus on value  combined with appealing in store presentations and customer communications 
sales in the home products and the apparel and accessories categories showed improvement over the prior year 
the various components affecting our results for fiscal are discussed in more detail below 
during fiscal  we focused on four key priorities increase relevancy to the customer  drive increased profitability  manage risk  and build great employee teams 
the following are some of the highlights from these efforts 
we completed the roll out of new register and point of sale technology in all our stores 
the new technology platform facilitates the acceptance of additional payment types  including credit cards and food stamps  and includes a number of computer based tools designed to provide our store managers with better training  analytics and workflow management 
we expanded our operating hours in substantially all of our stores to increase the convenience of the shopping experience 
in addition  to reinforce our value proposition and increase awareness of and loyalty to the family dollar brand  we worked to better integrate all of our customer communications 
we increased the frequency of our communications to customers  and we improved our in store communications to reinforce our values and brand offering 
we continued our space re alignment efforts to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience 
these efforts included re aligning the space in our stores to support an expanded assortment of key traffic driving categories  improving merchandise adjacencies and enhancing merchandise presentations 
since we began these efforts in fiscal  approximately of our stores have completed the layout changes 

table of contents through our price management work  the continued development of our private brand offering  and our global sourcing efforts  we improved our purchase mark ups and offset the impact of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumable merchandise 
we continued to focus on inventory productivity  and we lowered our inventory levels in more discretionary merchandise categories 
while our total inventories increased at the end of fiscal  due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise and to support higher sales growth  our inventory levels remain well controlled 
lower levels of discretionary merchandise have reduced our exposure to seasonal markdowns  and we believe our focus on inventory productivity has contributed to lower inventory shrinkage and a reduction in workers compensation and general liability claims 
we made great progress in our efforts to be a more compelling place to work 
we strengthened our pay for performance culture and expanded our training and development programs 
as a result  we drove continued improvement in our employee retention and internal promotion metrics  delivering more consistent execution for customers  increasing productivity and reducing costs 
fiscal outlook building on the improvements we have made over the past several years  we plan to continue to strengthen our value and convenience proposition in fiscal in addition  we plan to re accelerate our new store growth while also launching a comprehensive store renovation program 
our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of the utilization of stronger site selection tools as well as enhancements driven by our strategic initiatives 
our operational improvements  combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base  have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth 
during fiscal  we plan to open approximately new stores  a increase over fiscal openings 
we also expect to continue building the pipeline for further acceleration of our new store growth over the next two to three years 
leveraging our concept renewal efforts  enhanced merchandising and supply chain capabilities  a refreshed store technology platform  and a better trained and more productive workforce  we are initiating a comprehensive renovation program intended to re energize the family dollar brand 
during fiscal  we plan to renovate to stores at a projected cost of  to  per store 
the renovations will address both the interior and exterior of the stores and will create more customer focused assortments and layouts  rejuvenated physical stores and more customer centric teams 
while we are making significant investments to drive revenue growth  we also continue to pursue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and financial returns 
key areas of focus will include the continued expansion of our private brand programs and the continued development of our global sourcing capabilities  as well as our ongoing efforts to improve operational productivity 
see part i item business for more information on our current strategic initiatives 
during fiscal  we expect net sales to grow due to the acceleration of our new store growth and an increase in comparable stores sales 
we expect comparable store sales to increase as a result of our current strategic initiatives  including our store renovation program and private brand programs  as well as continued benefits from expanded operating hours and other operational improvements over the past several years 
we expect sales will continue to be strongest in the consumables category  as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  to be approximately flat  as expected benefits from lower markdowns  the expansion of our private brand program  improvements in price optimization  and lower inventory shrinkage are expected to be offset by the investments we are making to improve quality and protect our price perception  combined with continued pressure from transportation expense 
we expect sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  to decrease as a result of our comparable store sales growth and continued productivity improvements  which we expect will offset pressure from expanded operating hours  the acceleration of our new store growth and our renovation program 

table of contents results of operations our results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs years ended in thousands august  august  august  net sales cost and expenses cost of sales of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales cost of sales and operating expenses of net sales operating profit of net sales interest income of net sales interest expense of net sales income before income taxes of net sales income taxes of net sales net income of net sales net sales net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the net sales increases in fiscal and fiscal reflect increases in comparable store sales of and  respectively  with the balance of the increases due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program 
comparable store sales includes stores that have been open more than months 
stores that have been renovated  relocated or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in customer traffic  as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores 
during fiscal  the customer count increased approximately and the average customer transaction increased approximately to compared to fiscal sales during fiscal  on a comparable store basis  were strongest in the consumables and the seasonal and electronics categories 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted from an increase in customer traffic  as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction 
during fiscal  the customer count increased approximately and the average customer transaction increased approximately to compared to fiscal sales during fiscal  on a comparable store basis  were strongest in the consumables category 
sales in more discretionary categories were soft 
during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores for a net addition of stores  compared with the opening of stores and closing of stores for a net addition of stores during fiscal  and the opening of stores and closing of stores for a net addition of stores during fiscal 
table of contents cost of sales cost of sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were due primarily to additional sales volume 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower inventory shrinkage  higher purchase mark ups  lower freight expense  and lower markdown expense  which more than offset increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
we believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention  lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes 
we continue to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management work  the continued development of our private brand offering  and our global sourcing efforts 
freight expense benefited from improvements in inventory productivity  the impact of lower diesel costs on the first half of fiscal  and increased transportation productivity and efficiency 
markdown expense benefited from strong sales of seasonal merchandise  our continued focus on improving inventory productivity and managing inventory risk  and the absence of any markdown expense during fiscal for products containing lead phthalates 
we incurred approximately million of lead phthalate markdown expense during fiscal in connection with new product safety legislation 
the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower freight expense  lower inventory shrinkage  and lower seasonal markdowns 
in addition  higher purchase mark ups more than offset the effect of stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in these expenses were due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal most costs in fiscal  including occupancy costs  were leveraged as a result of a increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements 
as a percentage of net sales  decreases in insurance expense approximately of net sales and utility expense approximately of net sales more than offset an increase in store payroll expense approximately of net sales 
insurance expense continues to benefit from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability costs  and our energy management efforts contributed to the decrease in utility expense 
the increase in store payroll expense was due primarily to the expansion of our store operating hours 
the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher incentive compensation and higher insurance expense 
most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales  including payroll costs and occupancy costs  as a result of a increase in comparable store sales and our continued focus on expense control 
interest income interest income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decreases in both years were due to lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to lower capitalized interest 
we did not borrow under our credit facilities during fiscal or fiscal during fiscal  we incurred million in interest expense related to credit facility borrowings 
income taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in federal jobs tax credits  changes in state income taxes  and lower tax exempt interest income  offset partially by a decrease in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
the decrease in the effective rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in certain federal jobs tax credits and changes in state income tax  offset partially by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in tax exempt interest income 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general we have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our operating cash flows are generally sufficient to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments  interest payments  and share repurchases 
we believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
we plan to fund future share repurchases through a combination of cash on hand  cash from operations  and potential debt financings 
credit facilities on december   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility has an initial term of days and provides for two one year extensions that require lender consent 
any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
the credit facility replaced our previous million day credit facility 
we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on august  any borrowings under this credit facility also accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
outstanding standby letters of credit million as of august  reduce the amount available for borrowing under the million credit facility 
there were no borrowings under the credit facilities during fiscal the credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants  which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio 
as of august   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
our credit facilities mature within the next twelve months 
we are considering various options to extend the maturity profile of our credit facilities 
the availability and terms of any new credit agreement will depend on conditions in the credit markets 
long term debt on september   we obtained million through a private placement of unsecured senior notes the notes to a group of institutional accredited investors 
the notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with our other unsecured senior indebtedness 
the first tranche has an aggregate principal amount of million  is payable in a single installment on september   and bears interest at a rate of per annum from the date of issuance 
the second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of million  matures on september   with amortization commencing on september   and bears interest at a rate of per annum from the date of issuance 
the second tranche has a required principal payment of million on september   and on each september thereafter to and including september  interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on the th day of march and september of each year 
the notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants  which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio 
as of august   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
we are considering incurring additional debt in order to fund part of our million stock repurchase program  which we announced on september  we have not yet determined whether to do so or in what form  and the terms and availability of debt financing will depend on market conditions 
to facilitate new borrowing  we may make amendments to our existing credit facilities and or the notes 
in analyzing our credit we consider our ability to service not only our financial indebtedness but also our lease obligations 
other considerations our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal inventory per store at the end of fiscal was approximately higher than inventory per store at the end of fiscal the increases were due primarily to the expansion of our assortment of consumable merchandise and to support higher sales growth

our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were lower than at the end of fiscal inventory per store at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal the decrease in total inventory and inventory per store during fiscal was due to a decrease in discretionary merchandise

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard which established the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also considered sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the asc combines all non sec authoritative standards into a comprehensive database organized by topic 
the asc is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the asc during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the asc did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fair value guidance asc that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted the guidance with respect to financial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal the guidance became effective for non financial assets and liabilities for the first annual period beginning after november  we adopted the fair value guidance for non financial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of level and of the fair value hierarchy and the activity within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the updated guidance also clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation of assets or liabilities and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value 
the updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the new level activity disclosures  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted the applicable disclosure requirements during the third quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
subsequent events amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements asu 
asu reiterates that an sec filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the updated guidance was effective upon issuance 
we adopted asu during the second quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts 
stores receive a physical inventory at least annually 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 
table of contents property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five or ten years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on property and equipment 
insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense  which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
as of august   we recorded our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis  and recorded a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies 
in addition  our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset were separated into current and non current amounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
the insurance liabilities in our previous filings were recorded net of amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies  and were classified as current liabilities 
the prior year amounts in this report have also been adjusted to properly reflect the gross insurance liabilities and related insurance asset  as well as the current and non current classification on the consolidated balance sheets 
the changes were not material and had no impact on the consolidated statements of income or shareholders equity 
while certain changes were made to the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect the changes in operating assets and liabilities  there was no impact on total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
our total liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs were million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the liabilities is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other liabilities 
the insurance assets related to these amounts totaled million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other assets 
there were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal or fiscal our insurance expense during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs 
see our discussion of sg a expenses under results of operations above for more information 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the settlement of an income tax examination related to us federal income taxes for fiscal years and prior 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities 

table of contents contingent legal liabilities we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims 
our accruals  if any  related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
we re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available  and we adjust or establish accruals  if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our total legal liabilities were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the payment of the litigation judgment and other costs that were accrued in connection with the morgan litigation 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities 
stock based compensation expense we measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
the determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods  the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
our results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal include stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on stock based compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases 
during fiscal and fiscal  we did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities 
during fiscal we incurred million in interest expense related to our credit facilities 
our million of long term debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment securities 
our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid 
as of august   we had a million unrealized loss million net of taxes related to these investments 
we believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings  repurchases by the broker dealers  or upon maturity 
however  volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value
