the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements and item a  risk factors each included in this form k 
management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of our segments 
we have chosen to specifically include reported ebitda defined as segment net revenue less segment operating expense  plus or minus segment equity investment income or loss and for the real estate segment  plus gain on sale of real property and net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents  in the following discussion because we consider these measurements to be significant indications of our financial performance and available capital resources 
reported ebitda and net debt are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
we utilize reported ebitda in evaluating our performance and in allocating resource s to our segments 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc we also believe that net debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs

overview our operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate 
resort is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
revenue from the mountain  lodging and real estate segments represented  and  respectively  of our net revenue for fiscal mountain segment the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of five ski resort properties as well as ancillary services  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
our five ski resorts were open for business for the ski season from mid november through mid april  which is the peak operating season for the mountain segment 
our single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i destination guests and ii in state guests 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  while in state guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  which compares to approximately and  respectively  for the ski season and and  respectively  for the ski season 
destination guests generally purchase our higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental  as well as lodging at or around our resorts 
destination guest visitation is less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather due to the advance planning generally required for vacation trips  but can be more impacted by adverse economic conditions or the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more value oriented and weather sensitive 
prior to the ski season  we primarily marketed season passes to in state guests in an effort to offer a value option in turn for a commitment predominately prior to the beginning of the ski season from in state guests to ski at our resorts 
this in turn has developed a loyal cu stomer base that generally skis multiple days each season at our resorts and provides a more stabilized stream of lift revenue 
given the success of in state pass products  we introduced a new season pass product the epic season pass for the ski season  marketed to destination guests and also marketed to in state guests allowing pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all five of our ski resorts during the entire ski season 
all of our season pass products  including the epic season pass  are sold predominately prior to the start of the ski season 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the ski season 
for the  and ski season approximately  and  respectively  of total lift revenue recognized was comprised of season pass revenue 
the cost structure of our ski resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including  but not limited to  forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental cost of sales and labor  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  profit margins can fluctuate based on the level of revenues 
lodging segment operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including several proximate to our ski resorts  ii ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to our ski resorts  iii gtlc  iv cme  a resort ground transportation company  and v golf courses 
lodging properties including managed condominium rooms at or around our ski resorts  and cme  are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment and generally experience similar seasonal trends  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests  and represented approximately  and of lodging segment revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue of the lodging segment during our first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s operating season generally occurs from mid may to mid october  golf operations and seasonally low operations from our other owned and managed properties and businesses 
real estate segment the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around our resort communities and primarily engages in the vertical development of projects  as well as occasionally the sale of land to third party developers which often includes a contingent revenue structure based on the ultimate sale of the developed units 
revenue from vertical development projects is not recognized until closing of individual units within a project  which occurs after substantial completion of the project 
contingent future profits from land sales  if any  are recognized only when received 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of vertical development by often utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the pr oject  requiring significant non refundable deposits from buyers  and potentially obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects although our last two major vertical development projects have not incurred any direct third party financing 
additionally  our real estate development projects most often result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
our revenue from the real estate segment  and associated profit margin  fluctuate based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  causing volatility in the real estate segment s operating results from period to period 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact our future financial performance although we experienced improved operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal in our mountain segment in part due to a strong spring break and easter holiday period during which visitation to our mountain resorts improved  as well as an increase in overall guest spend on ancillary services to levels that approached the spring break and easter holiday periods of and  uncertainties still exist surrounding the strength and duration of the general economic environment 
conditions currently present or recently present in the economic environment including high unemployment  erosion of consumer confidence  financial instability in the global markets and weakness in the real estate market may potentially continue to have negative effects on the travel and leisure industry and our results of operations 
because of these uncertainties we cannot predict whether recent favorable trends in visitation and guest spend will continue and what impact the economic environment may have on our future results of operations  in particular for the ski season 
the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on mountain and lodging revenue particularly in regards to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation 
to help mitigate this impact  we sell a variety of season pass products prior to the beginning of the season to in state guests and destination guests 
additionally  we have invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
during the past three ski seasons  early season snowfall has been significantly lower than the historical average  which we believe had a negative impact on early season visitation 
our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn provides a guest commitment predominately prior to the start of the ski season  resulting in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue for us 
in the spring of  we introduced the epic season pass  which contributed to season pass revenue as a percent of total lift revenue increasing from for the ski season to and for the and ski seasons  respectively 
in march  we began our pre season pass sales program for the ski season  including the epic season pass 
during our spring season pass sales program we experienced a decline in advance sales of season pass products for the ski season primarily due to a decline in epic season pass sales compared to sales during the spring seaso n pass period for the ski season 
however  early fall sales of season passes have been favorable compared to the same period in the prior year which has resulted in only a slight overall decline to date in total season pass sales for the ski season compared to total season pass sales through the same early fall sales period for the ski season 
there can be no assurance that the season pass sales will be similar to historical trends or the overall impact that season pass sales will have on lift revenue for the ski season 
in response to the economic downturn in and  we implemented cost reduction initiatives in fiscal including a company wide wage reduction and suspension of our k plan matching contributions 
we reinstated some of the prior year s wage and benefit reductions with a interim wage increase for year round employees effective april  and seasonal employees for the ski season along with partial reinstatement of our matching component of the k plan 
we currently plan to fully reinstate the previous level of k matching ratably over a three year period 
we also expect to return in fiscal year ending july  fiscal to a more normal level of annual wage increases  however we cannot predict whether any increases in labor costs and other employee benefi t costs coupled with other increases in operating costs will be offset by increased revenues 
we held prices flat for most multi day lift ticket and certain other products and services for the last two ski seasons even though we have historically implemented annual price increases 
prices for the ski season have not yet been finalized  and as such  there can be no assurances as to the level of price increases  if any  which will occur and the impact that pricing may have on visitation or revenue 
we operate our ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of our operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities  therefore many of our on mountain capital improvements must go through an approval process 
changes or impacts to the applicable regulatory environment may have detrimental effects on us 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing or mix of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we closed on units  or of the units that were under contract at one ski hill place in breckenridge  while units that were under contract defaulted 
additionally  we have another real estate project substantially completed the ritz carlton residences  vail which units under contract will begin closing during the first quarter of fiscal w e have increased risk associated with selling and closing units in these projects as a result of the continued instability in the credit markets and a slowdown in the overall real estate market 
certain buyers have been or may be unable to close on their units due to a reduction in funds available to buyers and or decreases in mortgage availability and certain buyers may successfully seek rescission of their contracts see part i item legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the ultimate number of units that we will sell  the ultimate price we will receive  or when the units will sell 
additionally  if a prolonged weakness in the real estate market or general economic conditions were to occur we may have to adjust our selling prices in an effort to sell and close on units available for sale  although we currently have no plans to do so 
over the past several years our real estate segment results have reflected the successful completion of several real estate projects including  one ski hill place in breckenridge  the arrabelle at vail square  vail s front door  crystal peak lodge at breckenridge  gore creek place in vail s lionshead village and mountain thunder in breckenridge 
additionally  as mentioned above  we have substantially completed the ritz carlton residences  vail and units under contract will begin closing in the first quarter of fiscal although we continue to undertake planning and design work on future projects  we currently do not plan to undertake significant development activities on new projects until the current economic environment for real estate improves 
we believe that  due to our low carrying cost of real es tate land investments combined with the absence of third party debt associated with our real estate investments  we are well situated to time the launch of future projects with a more favorable economic environment 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  as well as million available under the revolver component of our credit facility 
we have and plan to continue to self fund the completion of the ritz carlton residences  vail we estimate to incur between million and million in cash expenditures subsequent to july  while we have from time to time been required to borrow under the revolver component of our credit facility  especially during our seasonal low points outside of the ski season  however  we believe we have reached an inflection point  where as future proceeds from anticipated real estate closings on one ski hill place and the ritz carlton residences  vail for example  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of ritz carlton residences  vail fractional units in september should now significantly exceed anticipated future construction costs on these projects 
under gaap  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually  which we do during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of our reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
our fiscal annual impairment test did not result in a goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
however  if a more severe prolonged weakness in general economic conditions were to occur it co uld cause less than expected growth and or reduction in terminal values of our reporting units which may result in a goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets  particularly related to our lodging operations

fiscal compared to fiscal lift revenue increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a million  or  increase in lift revenue excluding season passes and a million  or  increase in season pass revenue 
the increase in lift revenue excluding season passes was driven by a increase in visitation excluding season pass holders coupled with a increase in etp excluding pass products 
the increase in season pass revenue was due to an increase in season pass units sold  as well as year over year price increases in season pass products including the epic season pass 
total skier visitation increased led by our heavenly resort which experienced a increase in visitation while overall visitation for our four colorado resorts excluding heavenly increased 
our four colorado resorts were negatively impacted by significantly below average snowfall  particularly in the early season up to mid january  but experienced increased visitation during the second half of the ski season particularly during the spring break and easter holiday periods which primarily contributed to the overall increase in skier visits in colorado for the ski season compared to the ski season 
visitation by season pass holders increased by approximately with average visits per season pass holders declining approximately  or approximately one half a day less skied per season pass holder  over the ski season resulting in an increase in etp 
ski school revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in yield per skier visit as both group and private lessons benefited from higher guest spend and were also favorably impacted by new programs offered in ski school during the ski season 
dining revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to improved dining revenue for the ski season compared to the ski season as on mountain dining realized an increase in the average revenue per transaction of approximately  although dining operations were negatively impacted in the first half of the ski season by the significantly lower than average early season snowfall in colorado which resulted in delays in the opening of certain on mountain dining venues 
revenue from retail rental operations increased million  or  primarily due to higher retail sales and rental volumes at our vail  beaver creek and breckenridge mountain resort stores and san francisco bay area stores as retail rental revenue increased for the ski season compared to the ski season 
this increase was partially offset by declines in retail sales for both the first and fourth quarters of fiscal of and  respectively  compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to a decline in sales volumes at mountain resort stores not proximate to our ski resorts 
retail rental revenue was particularly strong in the second half of the ski season which was bolstered by increased visitation to our resorts and higher guest spend 
other revenue mainly consists of private club revenue which includes both club dues and amortization of initiation fees  summer visitation and other mountain activities revenue  strategic alliance and other marketing revenue  commercial leasing revenue  employee housing revenue  municipal services revenue and other recreation activity revenue 
for fiscal other revenues decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in employee housing revenue  strategic alliance marketing revenue and municipal services revenue primarily transportation services provided on behalf of certain municipalities  partially offset by an increase in private club revenues primarily resulting from the opening of the vail mountain club in november  increased commercial leasing revenue and higher on mounta in summer activities related revenue at our colorado resorts  particularly at breckenridge as the prior year s on mountain summer activities were negatively impacted by construction activities 
operating expense increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily driven by an increase in labor and labor related benefits expense of million  or  due to increased employee incentive compensation expense mostly offset by a company wide wage reduction plan implemented in april which was partially reinstated in april and the suspension of the matching contribution to our k program in january of which the k matching program was partially reinstated in april  a million  or  increase in resort related fees associated with higher mountain net revenue  including forest service fees which are calculated on a graduated scale based on revenue levels achieved by resort  and a million  or  increase in general and administr ative expenses primarily due to higher allocated corporate costs including increased employee incentive compensation expense  employee medical costs and legal expenses when compared to fiscal the above increases were offset by a million  or  decrease in retail cost of sales due to improved inventory management and lower average inventory costs resulting in improved gross margins and a million  or  decrease in other expenses due primarily to lower operating supply costs resulting from improved procurement practices in addition to lower fuel costs  repairs and maintenance and property tax expense 
mountain equity investment income primarily includes our share of income from the operations of a real estate brokerage joint venture 
the increase in equity investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decline in operating and legal costs  partially offset by decreased commissions earned by the brokerage due to a lower level of real estate closures primarily on multi unit projects compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal lift revenue decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  decline in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue  partially offset by an increase in season pass revenue of million  or 
the increase in season pass revenue was driven by higher season pass sales resulting primarily from the introduction of the epic season pass in the ski season 
additionally  a portion of the decline in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue was caused by a shift in destination guests purchasing the epic season pass instead of other lift ticket products 
total skier visitation was down in the ski season compared to the ski season  with overall visitation for the four colorado resorts excluding heavenly being down 
the overall visitation decline was primarily as a result of an estimated decrease in visitation from destination guests  partially offset by strong visitation from season pass holders  especially from the new epic season pass holders  who on average skied more in the current year per pass than holders of our other pass products 
etp decreased  driven by an increase in average season pass holder visitation per pass sold  partially offset by a increase in etp excluding season pass products  driven by price increases on certain lift ticket products 
revenues for our ski school  dining and retail rental operations  were all negatively impacted by the severe downturn in the economic environment in fiscal which resulted from the decrease in both destination guest visitation as well as overall spending per guest 
ski school revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  as ski school revenue is primarily driven by destination guests 
dining revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to an approximate decrease in the number of total on mountain food and beverage transactions  coupled with an even greater decline in fine dining 
revenue from retail rental operations decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower sales an d rental volumes at our mountain resort stores 
for fiscal other revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to private club operations which revenue increased million resulting from the opening of the vail mountain club in november operating expense decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in labor and labor related benefits expense of million  or  due to decreased staffing levels driven by lower volume in ski school  dining and retail rental operations as well as the impacts of cost reduction initiatives including the suspension of the matching contribution to our k program effective january and a company wide wage reduction plan implemented in april and a million  or  decrease in retail cost of sales commensurate with the decrease in retail revenue 
additionally  resort related fees including forest service fees  other resort related fees  credit card fees and commissions decreased million  or  compared to fiscal d ue to overall declines in revenue that those fees are calculated on and other expenses decreased million  or  due primarily to lower food and beverage cost of sales  supplies and fuel expense  partially offset by higher property taxes  utilities and repairs and maintenance expense 
all of the above decreases were slightly offset by a million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses 
mountain equity investment income primarily includes our share of income from the operations of a real estate brokerage joint venture 
the decrease in equity investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to decreased commissions earned by the brokerage due to a lower level of real estate closures compared to fiscal lodging segment lodging segment operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are presented by category as follows in thousands  except adr and revpar percentage year ended july  increase decrease lodging net revenue owned hotel rooms managed condominium rooms dining transportation golf other total lodging net revenue lodging operating expense labor and labor related benefits general and administrative other total lodging operating expense total lodging reported ebitda owned hotel statistics adr revpar managed condominium statistics adr revpar owned hotel and managed condominium statistics combined adr revpar total lodging reported ebitda includes million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively

the decrease in occupancy was primarily due to declines in occupancy at our keystone lodging properties of percentage points 
this decrease was partially offset by a percentage point increase in occupancy at our other lodging properties proximate to our ski resorts excluding keystone lodging properties during the second half of the ski season due to increased visitation particularly during the spring break and easter holiday periods as discussed in the mountain segment and an increase in occupancy at gtlc of percentage points in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal driven by an increase in both transient and group room nights gtlc s room revenue increased million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
revenue from managed condominium rooms decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  driven by a decrease in occupancy of percentage points partially offset by an increase in adr of 
the decrease in occupancy is largely attributed to declines in group and transient room nights primarily at our keystone lodging properties 
dining revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decline in group visitation primarily at our keystone lodging properties 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in dining revenue of million at gtlc in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an increase in occupancy as discussed above 
transportation revenues were up million  or  primarily due to a full twelve months of operations for cme included in fiscal compared to only nine months of operations for cme in fiscal golf revenues decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily resulting from a decrease in the number of golf rounds played

the above decreases were partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of million  or  primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses including increased employee incentive compensation expense  employee medical costs and legal expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal total lodging net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of cme on november  and a full year of operations at the arrabelle at vail square hotel the arrabelle which opened in january cme operations contributed million in net revenue for fiscal and the full year operations of the arrabelle contributed million in revenue for fiscal compared to net revenue of million for the partial year of operations of the arrabelle in fiscal revenue from owned hotel rooms  including the arrabelle  decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was driven by a decrease in occupancy of percentage points which primarily occurred at the lodging properties proximate to our ski resorts 
this was due to a decline in destination visitation for the ski season as compared to the ski season as discussed in our mountain segment and declines in group business including a decrease in gtlc s room revenue of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to a decline in group business as well as decreases in adr of  partially offset by the full year of operations at the arrabelle the arrabelle generated million of incremental owned hotel room r evenue for fiscal compared to fiscal

real estate segment real estate segment operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are presented by category as follows in thousands percentage year ended july  increase decrease total real estate net revenue real estate operating expense cost of sales including sales commissions other total real estate operating expense gain on sale of real property total real estate reported ebitda total real estate reported ebitda includes million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our real estate operating revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period 
different types of projects have different revenue and profit margins  therefore  as the real estate inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment net revenue  operating expense and real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and affordable housing units associated with the jhg tc development million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the one ski hill place average price per square foot is driven by its premier ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge  its close proximity to the breckconnect gondola and other lifts and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
additionally  during fiscal we recognized million of revenue related to deposit s from buyers who defaulted on units under contract at one ski hill place  and recorded a gain on sale of real property of million net of million in related cost of sales for a land parcel located at the arrowhead base area of the beaver creek resort which sold for million 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million resulting from the closing of condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of and million resulting from the closing of affordable housing units associated with the jhg tc development average cost per square foot of  net of impairment charges taken in previous periods 
the cost per square foot for one ski hill place is reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with this project compared to other breckenridge properties and high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock bas ed compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of eight lodge at vail chalet chalet units million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and two units at the arrabelle million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the higher average price per square foot for the chalet units was driven by their premier location at the base of vail mountain in vail village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive chalets 
the arrabelle a verage price per square foot is driven by its ski in ski out location in vail  and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
the crystal peak lodge average price per square foot though significantly lower than the vail project real estate sales  is significantly higher than historical breckenridge project real estate sales and is primarily driven by its ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge and close proximity to the breckconnect gondola 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on eight chalet units million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of and two units at the arrabelle million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the arrabelle and chalets are reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with these projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the cost per square foot for crystal peak lodge is reflective of its less complicated design features and fewer amenities associated with this project relative to the arrabelle and chalets 
add itionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which include marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
in addition  included in other segment operating expense for fiscal  we recorded million of estimated costs in excess of anticipated sales proceeds for an affordable housing commitment resulting from the cancellation of a contract by a third party developer related to our jhg tc development 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of condominium units at the arrabelle million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  the closings of five chalet units million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  the closings of remaining jhg tc cabins million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of and contingent gains of million on development parcel sales that closed in previous periods 
the higher average price per square foot for the chalet units was driven by the premier location at the base of vail mountain in vail village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive chalets 
the arrabelle average price per square foot is driven by its ski in ski out location in vail  and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
the jhg tc cabins yielded a lower price per square foot as its location is proximate to golf and tennis facilities which does not have as strong of a demand compared to real estate featuring ski in ski out locations proximate to our ski resorts 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on units at the arrabelle million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  the closing on five chalet units million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  and the closing of the remaining jhg tc cabins million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the arrabelle and chalets are reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with these projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the average cost per square foot for the jhg tc was significantly lower than for other projects closed durin g the period due to the fact that this project did not include the typical high end features of our projects that are in close proximity to our mountain resorts  however  the cost of sales for the jhg tc cabins were relatively high compared to the revenue earned due to unanticipated incremental design and construction related costs 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which include marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to our overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal and fiscal increased primarily due to the full year impact of an increase in the fixed asset base from the placing in service of significant resort assets over the last three years  which included  among other assets  the arrabelle including amenities such as a private club  spa  commercial leasing space  and other skier services facilities  a new skier services building in vail village  a private club the vail mountain club  multiple gondolas and lifts within the last three years and software platforms associated with our central reservation systems 
investment income  net 
the decrease in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in average invested cash during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the average interest rate earned on investments the average interest rate earned decreased by approximately percentage points during the period  as well as a decrease in average invested cash during the period 
interest expense  net 
the reduction in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest on self funded real estate projects 
the reduction in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to the payoff of a scheduled debt maturity in fiscal and capitalized interest on self funded real estate projects 
capitalized interest was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
contract dispute credit  net 
on october   rockresorts received payment of the final settlement from cheeca holdings  llc the cheeca settlement  related to the disputed contract termination of the formerly managed rockresorts cheeca lodge spa property  in the amount of million  of which million net of final attorney s fees is recorded in contract dispute credit  net in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal income taxes 
our tax provision and effective tax rate are driven primarily by the amount of pre tax income  which is adjusted for items that are deductible non deductible for tax purposes only ie permanent items  taxable income generated by state jurisdictions that varies from the consolidated pre tax income and the amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  the income tax provision recorded for fiscal reflects a million income tax benefit due to a reversal of an income tax contingency resulting from the expiration of the statue of limitations and the fiscal income tax provision refle cts the impact of a favorable tax settlement with state tax authorities of million 
beginning august   we adopted a new accounting pronouncement regarding noncontrolling interest see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which requires that the net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in a company s consolidated subsidiaries no longer be included in the determination of pretax income or loss in the company s effective tax rate calculation 
including noncontrolling interests in pre tax income  our effective tax rate would have been  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in  we amended previously filed tax returns for the tax years from through in an effort to remove restrictions under section of the internal revenue code on approximately million nols relating to fresh start accounting from our reorganization in as a result  we requested a refund related to the amended returns in the amount of million and have reduced our federal tax liability in the amount of million in subsequent tax returns 
in  the irs completed its examination of our filing position in our amended returns and disallowed our request for refund and our position to remove the restriction on the nols 
we appealed the examiner s disallowance of the nols to the office of appeals 
in december  the office of appeals denied our appeal  as w ell as a request for mediation 
we disagree with the irs interpretation disallowing the utilization of the nols and in august  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado seeking recovery of million in over payments that were previously denied by the irs  plus interest 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of the nols  we have not reflected any of the benefits of the utilization of the nols within our financial statements  thus if we are unsuccessful in our action regarding this matter it will not negatively impact our results of operations 
reconciliation of non gaap measures the following table reconciles from segment reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc in thousands year ended july  mountain reported ebitda lodging reported ebitda resort reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda total reported ebitda depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of fixed assets  net investment income  net interest expense  net contract dispute credit  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to vail resorts  inc the following table reconciles net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents in thousands july  long term debt long term debt due within one year total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt liquidity and capital resources significant sources of cash historically  we have lower cash available as of our fiscal year end as well as at the end of our first fiscal quarter of each year as compared to our second and third fiscal quarters end primarily due to the seasonality of our mountain segment operations 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing or mix of closings on and investment in real estate development projects 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of july   compared to million as of july  we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million and million generated during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we currently anticipate that resort reported ebitda will continue to prov ide a significant source of future operating cash flows 
additionally  we believe we have reached an inflection point  where as  anticipated future closings of one ski hill place and ritz carlton residences  vail units will provide a source of cash flows from operations in fiscal for example  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of ritz carlton residences  vail fractional units in september and beyond that we expect will now significantly exceed anticipated future construction costs on these projects as further discussed below within significant uses of cash 
however  we cannot predict the ultimate amount of proceeds we will receive given the current state of the real estate market as well as the fact that certain buyers may be unable to close on their units due to a reduction in funds available to buyers and or decreases in mortgage availability 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents at july   we have available million under our credit facility which represents the total commitment of million less the current outstanding balance of million and certain letters of credit outstanding of million 
our plan to self fund the completion of ritz carlton residences  vail we estimate to incur between million to million in cash expenditures subsequent to july  combined with historically lower operating cash flows during our first fiscal quarter will require us to borrow under the revolver component of our credit facility from time to time 
we expect that our liquidity needs in the near term will be met by continued utilization of operating cash flows primarily those generated in our second and third fisc al year quarters  as well as borrowings under the credit facility  if needed  and proceeds from anticipated real estate closings 
we believe the credit facility  which matures in  provides adequate flexibility and is priced favorably with any new borrowings currently being priced at libor plus 
fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  a decrease of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the decline in operating cash flows was primarily a result of increased real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions compared to real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions 
additionally  investments in real estate increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal further contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was the receipt of million of private club initiation fees for the vail mountain clu b in fiscal and a reduction in restricted cash of million in the fiscal which became available for general purpose use due to the payoff of our non recourse real estate financing 
partially offsetting the above items were improved operating cash flows from our resort operations of approximately million  a decrease in income tax payments of million and a decrease in the change in accounts receivable of and an increase in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in resort capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of cme for million in fiscal and the cash receipt of million primarily related to a land parcel we sold during fiscal  partially offset by the acquisition of mountain news for million in fiscal cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting from an increase in net borrowings of million  the payoff of our non recourse real estate financings and scheduled debt maturity of million and million  respectively in fiscal and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of million during fiscal partially offsetting the above items was the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv for million on april  fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal and was primarily a result of increased real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions compared to real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits received on projects under development decreased million  partially offset by a reduction in investments in real estate of million 
further contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was a decrease in cash generated by resort operations including a decrease in resort reported ebitda of million for fiscal compared to fiscal and a decline in accounts payable and other ac crued liabilities of million primarily as a result of a decline in real estate investment activity and lower trade payables associated with lower operating volume  as well as the receipt of million in cash net of legal costs for the cheeca settlement in fiscal offsetting the above items was the receipt of million in proceeds for the final installment related to private club initiation fees to the vail mountain club that opened in november and a reduction in restricted cash of million which became available for general purpose use due to the payoff of our non recourse real estate financings 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million for fiscal primarily due to a decrease in resort capital expenditures of million offset by the acquisition of cme for million 
cash used in financing activities decreased million primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was partially offset by an increase in net payments of debt related to non recourse real estate financings of million and the payoff of million for a scheduled debt maturity during fiscal significant uses of cash our cash uses currently include providing for operating expenditures  capital expenditures for assets to be used in operations and for real estate under development 
we expect to spend approximately million to million in calendar year on real estate investments  including the construction of associated resort related depreciable assets  of which approximately million was spent as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of the calendar year for the completion of ritz carlton residences  vail and other projects 
we have entered into contracts with third parties to provide services to us throughout the course of project development  commitments for future services to be performed under such current contracts total approximately million and are expected to be performed primarily over the remainder of the calendar year 
we currently have no plans to commit to the development of significant new real e state projects 
we have historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for our resort operations  and expect to continue to invest in the future  however  plans for such investment were reduced in calendar year given the significant level of capital expenditures made in the previous few years including individually significant projects that do not annually re occur such as gondolas and major hotel renovations coupled with the economic environment 
we have increased our level of expected resort discretionary investment for calendar year above the calendar year level  although such spending is still expected to remain below the and calendar year levels 
current capital expenditure levels will primarily include investments that allow us to maintain our high quality standards  as well as certain incremental discretionary improvements at our five ski resorts and throughout our owned hotels 
we evaluate additional discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment 
we currently anticipate we will spend approximately million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar year  excluding resort depreciable assets arising from real estate activities noted above 
included in these capital expenditures are approximately million to million which are necessary to maintain appearance and level of service appropriate to our resort operations  including routine replacement of snow grooming equipment and rental fleet equipment 
discretionary expenditures for calendar include a new high speed chairlift to serve vail mountain s back bowls  a new on mountain restaurant at heavenly  a new coaster slide at breckenridge  expansion of vail mountain s adventure ridge  keystone lodge guest room ren ovation  new marketing campaign management software and software development as well as radio frequency scanners at each lift to support the newly launched epicmix initiative among other projects 
we currently plan to utilize cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit facility and or cash flow generated from future operations to provide the cash necessary to execute our capital plans 
additionally  we do not expect to make any significant income tax payments throughout fiscal due to estimated tax losses from august through december we are a calendar year tax payer and planned accelerated tax deductions  subject to a settlement of the dispute with the irs over the utilization of nols previously discussed 
principal payments on the majority of our long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
as of july  and  total debt obligations including long term debt due within one year were million and million  respectively  with the increase at july  being primarily due to borrowings under the credit facility 
net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents increased from million as of july  to million as of july  due primarily to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our credit facility 
our debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as we had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause our annual interest payments to change by approximately million 
the fluctuation in our debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under our credit facility or other alternative financing arrangements  including non recourse real estate financings  we may enter into 
our long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under the credit facility  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
 we can respond to liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic environment by managing our capital expenditures and the timing of new real estate development activity 
our credit facility is scheduled to mature in fiscal and our senior subordinated notes are due in fiscal in fiscal  we may consider obtaining new financing or re financing one or both of these debt financings depending on many factors including current credit markets and terms available to us 
on march   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock and on july  approved an increase of our common stock repurchase authorization by an additional  shares 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
since inception of this stock repurchase plan through july   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
as of july    shares remained available to repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under our employee share award plans 
acquisitions under the sto ck repurchase program may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the timing as well as the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors  including our future financial performance  our available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future  the restrictions in our fourth amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of january   as amended  between the vail corporation our wholly owned subsidiary  bank of america  na as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indenture  governing the notes  prevailing prices of our common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive 
the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 
covenants and limitations we must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants under our credit facility and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit facility covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  interest coverage ratio and the minimum net worth each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit our ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
our borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on our segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in our debt instruments as of july  we expect that we will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that we will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while we anticipate that we would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  construction agreements in conjunction with our development activities and lease agreements 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of july  obligations under construction contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until services and or goods are received which is in accordance with gaap 
additionally  operating lease and service contract obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our contractual ob ligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments  as well as long term debt payments  included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   our annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  is anticipated to be approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and 
million for at least each of the next three years subsequent to fiscal the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt 
purchase obligations include amounts which are classified as trade payables  real estate development payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes including taxes for uncertain tax positions  liabilities to complete real estate projects on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received  including construction contracts not included on our balance sheet as of july  in accordance with gaap 
other long term obligations include amounts which become due based on deficits in underlying cash flows of the metropolitan district as described in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies which were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we also have other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate revenue and cost of sales description we utilize the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for condominium units sold within a project and or individual parcels of real estate  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the determination of cost of sales may utilize estimates for the fair value of resort depreciable assets that may be part of a mixed use real estate development project and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either the relative sales values of the components of a project  which may include resort depreciable assets  or the total projected costs to be incurred to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels of real estate and or condominium units within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates of either the relative sales values of the components of a project or remaining costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method would have changed the profit margin recognized by our real estate segment by approximately million for fiscal goodwill and intangible assets description the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second st ep of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
judgments and uncertainties application of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
these analyses require significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  available industry market data to the extent available  estimation of the long ter m rate of growth for our business including expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of the timing and degree of any economic recovery  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur including terminal multiples  determination of the respective weighted average cost of capital and market participant assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and allocate goodwill to our reporting units based on the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition generating the goodwill 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are at least tested for impairment annually as of may st of each year 
based upon our annual impairment test performed during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values and as such no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
however  we determined that our colorado lodging reporting unit million of goodwill as of july  within our lodging segment was at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test  with the fair value of the reporting unit estimated at approximately in excess of its carrying value and is therefore at risk for a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows  terminal multiples and or weighted average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the colorado lodging reporting unit may include such items as i a prolonged weakness in the general economic conditions in which the colorado lodging unit operates and therefore negatively impacting group and transient room nights and adr especially at our keystone lodging properties  ii an economic recovery that significantly differs fr om our assumptions in timing and or degree  and iii volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in a higher discount rate 
while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
tax contingencies description we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more like ly than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which we may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and we have adequate reserves for our tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in our tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable  other long term liabilities and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities or intangible assets in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture and fixtures  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are primarily depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or we could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our useful lives of the assets contain uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for fiscal new accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  we generally have been able to pass the increase on to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on our future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results our mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and our owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season results in operating losses 
revenue and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from certain managed properties  certain other lodging properties and golf operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off season losses from our mountain and other lodging operations 
during fiscal  of total combined mountain and lodging segment net revenue was earned during the sec ond and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   we had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing approximately of our total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would result in our annual interest payments changing by million 
our market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
