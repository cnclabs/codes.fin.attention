corporate integrity agreement on march   pharmerica ltc and the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services oig entered into the corporate integrity agreement cia to promote compliance with the requirements of the federal healthcare programs 
under the cia  pharmerica ltc agreed to continue its comprehensive compliance program  which includes a corporate compliance officer  a corporate compliance committee  a code of ethics and business conduct  written policies and procedures  educational and training initiatives  review and disciplinary procedures  a confidential disclosure program  an ineligible persons screening program  and internal audit and review procedures  all designed to promote compliance with applicable laws  including federal healthcare program requirements and the promotion of ethical business practices 
pharmerica ltc is also subject to extensive reporting requirements under the cia  including annual reports describing pharmerica ltc s compliance activities  notices of any government investigations or legal proceedings  overpayments received from federal healthcare programs and changes in pharmacy locations and new business units 
the term of the cia is five years and it ends on march  pharmerica ltc is required to comply fully and timely with all of the cia requirements 
failure to do so may lead to the imposition of stipulated penalties  including substantial monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
any such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
the cia continues to apply to pharmerica ltc through its original term 
pursuant to an agreement reached with the oig regarding the pharmacy transaction s impact on the cia  the cia s requirements do not apply to kps or any of the kps employees or contractors 
however  among other obligations  the corporation s employees and contractors that are involved with pharmerica ltc s operations will be subject to training requirements in accordance with the cia s existing terms 
in addition  pursuant to the agreement reached with the oig  oversight of  and day to day responsibility for  the cia is undertaken by the corporation s compliance officer and the corporation s compliance committee an ad hoc committee comprised of members of the corporation s senior management 
employees as of december   we have approximately  employees which includes approximately  part time employees 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we employ approximately  licensed pharmacists 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good 
government regulation general extensive federal  state and local regulations govern institutional pharmacies and the healthcare facilities that they serve 
these regulations cover licenses  staffing qualifications  conduct of operations  reimbursement  recordkeeping and documentation requirements and the confidentiality and security of health related information 
our institutional pharmacies are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements between healthcare providers  including the federal anti kickback statutes and the federal physician self referral statutes 

table of contents licensure  certification and regulation states generally require that the state board of pharmacy license a pharmacy operating within the state 
many states also regulate out of state pharmacies that deliver prescription products to patients or residents in their states 
we have the necessary pharmacy state licenses  or pending applications  for each pharmacy we operate 
our pharmacies are also registered with the appropriate federal and state authorities pursuant to statutes governing the regulation of controlled substances 
in addition  pharmacists  nurses and other healthcare professionals who provide services on our behalf are in most cases required to obtain and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding professional standards of conduct 
the drug enforcement agency the dea  the us food and drug administration the fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances 
these laws impose a host of requirements on the pharmaceutical supply channel  including providers of institutional pharmacy services 
under the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of  as a dispenser of controlled substances  we must register with the dea  file reports of inventories and transactions and provide adequate security measures 
in addition  we are required to comply with all the relevant requirements of the prescription drug marketing act for the transfer and shipment of pharmaceuticals 
the fda  dea and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers  including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal  civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 
we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that our pharmacy operations are in substantial compliance with applicable federal and state good manufacturing practice requirements 
client long term care facilities are separately required to be licensed in the states in which they operate and  if serving medicaid or medicare patients  must be certified to be in compliance with applicable program participation requirements 
client facilities are also subject to the nursing home reforms of the obra of  as amended  which imposed strict compliance standards relating to quality of care for nursing home operations  including vastly increased documentation and reporting requirements 
on september   cms issued revised guidance to surveyors of long term care facilities regarding the survey protocol for review of pharmacy services provided in long term care facilities participating in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the new guidelines  which became effective december   expanded the areas and detail in which surveyors are to assess pharmacy services at the facility  including ordering  acquiring  receiving  storing  labeling  dispensing and disposing of all medications at the facility  the provision of medication related information to health care professionals and residents  the process of identifying and addressing medication related issues through medication regimen reviews and collaboration between the licensed consultant pharmacist  the facility and other healthcare professionals  and the provision  monitoring and use of medication related devices 
the guidelines also emphasize the important role of consultative services of pharmacists in promoting safe and effective medication use through the coordination of all aspects of pharmacy services provided to all residents within a facility 
in addition  on september   the oig published oig supplemental compliance program guidance for nursing facilities 
with quality of care the first risk area identified  the supplemental guidance is part of a series of recent government efforts focused on improving quality of care at skilled nursing and long term care facilities 
the guidance contains new compliance recommendations and an expanded discussion of risk areas 
the guidance stressed that facilities must provide pharmaceutical services to meet the needs of each resident and should be mindful of potential quality of care problems when implementing policies and procedures on proper medication management 
it further stated that facilities can reduce risk by educating staff on medication management and improper pharmacy kickbacks for consultant pharmacists and that facilities should review the total compensation paid to consultant pharmacists to ensure it is not structured in a way that reflects the volume or value of particular drugs prescribed or administered to residents 

table of contents laws affecting referrals and business practices we are subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services 
these laws include the federal anti kickback statute  which prohibits  among other things  knowingly or willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying remuneration including any kickback  bribe or rebate directly or indirectly in return for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  and the federal stark laws which prohibit  with limited exceptions  the referral of patients by physicians for certain designated health services  to an entity with which the physician has a financial relationship 
these laws impact the relationships that we may have with potential referral sources 
we have a variety of relationships with potential referral sources  including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities with which we have contracted to provide pharmacy services 
with respect to the anti kickback statute  the oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution 
while we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors  certain of our current arrangements  none of which is material to us  may not qualify for safe harbor protection 
failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
while we believe our practices comply with the anti kickback statute  we cannot assure you that our practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 
as one means of providing guidance to healthcare providers  the oig issues special fraud alerts 
these alerts do not have the force of law  but identify features of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the arrangements or transactions violate the anti kickback statute or other federal health care laws 
the oig has identified several arrangements  which  if accompanied by inappropriate intent  constitute suspect practices  including a the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities  b provision of free or significantly discounted billing  nursing or other staff services  c free training in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques  d purchasing goods or services from potential referral sources at prices in excess of their fair market value  and e rental of space from potential referral sources at other than fair market value terms 
the oig has encouraged persons having information about entities that offer the above types of incentives to report such information to the oig 
the oig also issues special advisory bulletins as a means of providing guidance to healthcare providers 
these bulletins  along with the special fraud alerts  have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities  including contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business and those providing items or services for which medicare or medicaid pays 
in addition to issuing special fraud alerts and special advisory bulletins  the oig from time to time issues compliance program guidance for certain types of healthcare providers 
these guidance documents contain voluntary actions for providers to consider to promote compliance with medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
although the oig has not issued compliance guidance for long term care pharmacies  the oig has issued compliance guidance for hospitals  nursing facilities and suppliers of durable medical equipment  which may be instructive 
these guidance documents advise entities to adopt policies and procedures to address the risks arising from  among other things a arrangements with vendors that result in the facility receiving non covered items at below market prices or at no charge  provided the facility orders medicare reimbursed products  b soliciting or receiving items of value in exchange for providing the supplier access to patients medical records and other information needed to bill medicare  c joint ventures with entities supplying goods or services  and d discounts and other financial incentives given to potential referral sources 

table of contents further  the oig frequently issues advisory opinions to provide specific guidance on the applicable health care fraud laws and regulations 
interested parties are able to submit detailed information to the oig describing a particular arrangement and the oig will explain whether or not it implicates these laws and whether or not the oig will elect to enforce in the described situation 
although these opinions are only binding for the party disclosing  they provide helpful guidance on a variety of potential arrangements with physicians 
in addition to federal law  many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs 
violations of these laws may result in fines  imprisonment  denial of payment for services and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and other state funded programs 
other provisions in the social security act and in other federal and state laws authorize the imposition of penalties  including criminal and civil fines and exclusions from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for false claims  improper billing and other offenses 
these laws include the federal false claims act  under which private parties have the right to bring qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false claims for payments to the government 
recent changes to the false claims act  expanding liability to certain additional parties and circumstances  may make these qui tam law lawsuits more prevalent 
some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims laws 
in addition  a number of states have undertaken enforcement actions against pharmaceutical manufacturers involving pharmaceutical marketing programs  including looking at relationships with pharmacies and programs containing incentives for pharmacists to dispense one particular product rather than another 
these enforcement actions arose under various state laws including fraud and abuse laws and consumer protection laws which generally prohibit false advertising  deceptive trade practices and the like 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject regularly to inquiries  investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations 
we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense 
federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections  citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments  terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs  bars on medicare and medicaid payments and fines 
to date  we have not experienced any demands for refund of overpayments  terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs  bars on medicare and medicaid payments or fines that are material to us 
however  such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and liquidity 
we believe our contract arrangements with other healthcare providers  our pharmaceutical suppliers and our pharmacy practices are in substantial compliance with applicable federal and state laws 
these laws may  however  be interpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation and application 
state laws affecting access to services some states have enacted freedom of choice or any willing provider requirements as part of their state medicaid programs or in separate legislation 
these laws may preclude a nursing center from requiring their patients and residents to purchase pharmacy or other ancillary medical services or supplies from particular providers that have a supplier relationship with the nursing center 
limitations such as these may increase the competition which we face in providing services to nursing center residents 

table of contents hipaa the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  mandates the adoption of regulations aimed at standardizing transaction formats and billing codes for documenting medical services  dealing with claims submissions and protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
hipaa regulations that standardize transactions and code sets require standard formatting for healthcare providers  like us  that submit claims electronically 
the hipaa privacy regulations apply to protected health information  which is defined generally as individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium  excluding certain education records and student medical records 
the privacy regulations seek to limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications  as well as those in electronic form  regarding an individual s past  present or future physical or mental health or condition  or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare  if the individual can or may be identified by such information 
hipaa provides for the imposition of civil or criminal penalties if protected health information is improperly disclosed 
hipaa s security regulations require us to ensure the confidentiality  integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create  receive  maintain or transmit 
we must protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information and the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
in addition to hipaa  we are subject to state privacy laws and other state privacy or health information requirements not preempted by hipaa  including those which may furnish greater privacy protection for individuals than hipaa 
the scope of our operations involving health information is broad and the nature of those operations is complex 
although we believe that our contract arrangements with healthcare payers and providers and our business practices are in material compliance with applicable federal and state electronic transmissions  privacy and security of health information laws  the requirements of these laws  including hipaa  are complicated and are subject to interpretation 
in addition  state regulation of matters also covered by hipaa  especially the privacy standards  is increasing  and determining which state laws are preempted by hipaa is a matter of interpretation 
failure to comply with hipaa or similar state laws could subject us to loss of customers  denial of the right to conduct business  civil damages  fines  criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 
stimulus package the american recovery and responsibility act  commonly known as the stimulus package  is a billion federal bill intended to stimulate the economy through both tax cuts and increased government spending 
within this package there are a variety of healthcare related provisions including i the billion temporary increase in medicaid federal medical assistance percentage fmap  and ii the billion of funding to encourage adoption of certain health information technology hit 
under medicaid fmap  the federal government matches certain state expenditures for medicaid social service programs 
as such  the billion increase in fmap goes directly from the federal government to eligible states 
eligible states will receive a minimum fmap increase retroactive to october  and going forward to december   with additional funds going to states with higher unemployment rates 
to ensure eligibility for the fmap increase  states must maintain or reinstate previously required medicaid eligibility standards  comply with prompt pay requirements and meet certain other specific criteria 
although the funds are through the fmap program  states receive the money as general funds and  aside from a prohibition against placing the money in a rainy day fund  may expend the funds at the states discretion 
hhs continues to release determinations of enhanced payments on a rolling basis  effective for the quarter year periods 

table of contents the stimulus package also provides billion designated for investment in hit infrastructure and medicare and medicaid incentives to encourage doctors  hospitals  and other providers to adopt hit 
of this funding  billion is set aside for adoption activities while billion will go to providers engaged in the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr 
meaningful users are providers who use certified ehr technology  exchange ehr information to improve quality and coordination of care  and use ehr to submit quality measures 
for physicians  the structure largely mirrors the e prescribing framework set out in the medicare improvements for patients and providers act mippa by incentivizing adoption of hit through granting up to  per physician until  and thereafter penalizing physicians who have not yet adopted 
similarly  hospitals are eligible for bonus payments if determined to be meaningful users of ehr 
the impact of these provisions  according to the congressional budget office  will be that approximately of doctors and of hospitals adopt ehr technology over the next years 
the impact of the stimulus package is unclear at this time 
proposed federal budget and health care reform the proposed federal budget for fiscal year builds on the health provisions of the stimulus package while simultaneously introducing new healthcare related programs generally aimed at improving quality  efficiency  and accountability  and at encouraging shared responsibility for health care 
the proposed budget does not include many program specifics and will not necessarily parallel the final version as altered and approved by congress 
the most significant aspect of the proposed budget is a new billion reserve fund to help finance future healthcare reform 
this is proposed to be funded by both tax changes and medicare and medicaid reform 
the budget specifies increasing medicaid rebates and broadening utilization of generics as some of the many parts of the health reform reserve fund 
the exact nature and structure of such reform is being debated by congress and the obama administration and cannot be predicted with any certainty 
in conjunction  congress and the obama administration are debating significant restructuring of the health care system as a whole  the impact of which is unclear at this time 
beyond healthcare reform  the budget expands funding for a variety of programs including comparative effectiveness and cancer research 
in addition  the proposed budget builds on and implements a variety of provisions of the stimulus package 
at this time  however  all these provisions are solely the administration s recommendation 
the house and senate are currently working on separate versions of the budget 
without a final version of the appropriations bills  we are unable to analyze the potential impact of these fiscal changes on our business 
federal trade commission red flag rules the recently issued identity theft red flag and address discrepancy rules  referred to as the red flag rules  which the ftc will begin to enforce on june   require creditors that maintain certain kinds of covered accounts to develop and implement a written program to detect and respond to identity theft 
because the corporation does not require full payment at the time of service of a patient  it will be considered a creditor for purposes of the red flag rules 
therefore  the corporation will be required to implement a program to detect and respond to identity theft 
failure to implement a program by the deadline can result in substantial monetary penalties 
the deadline for compliance with these rules  as well as the scope of their application  has been subject to various regulatory  legislative  and judicial changes 
as such  we cannot fully analyze the potential impact of these red flag rules on our business 
overview of reimbursement medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over and to certain disabled persons 
medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state that provides healthcare benefits to certain indigent patients 
within the medicare and medicaid statutory framework  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion that may affect payments made under medicare and medicaid 

table of contents we receive payment for our services from institutional healthcare providers  commercial medicare part d plans  third party payers  government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid  and other non government sources such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  and contracted providers 
with respect to our skilled nursing facilities customers  their residents are covered by medicare part a  part b and part d plans  medicaid  insurance  and other private payers including managed care 
medicare the medicare program consists of four parts medicare part a  which covers  among other things  in patient hospital  skilled nursing facilities  home healthcare  and certain other types of healthcare services  medicare part b  which covers physicians services  outpatient services  and certain items and services provided by medical suppliers such as intravenous therapy  a managed care option for beneficiaries who are entitled to medicare part a and enrolled in medicare part b  known as medicare part c or medicare advantage  and medicare part d  which provides coverage for prescription drugs that are not otherwise covered under medicare part a or part b for those beneficiaries that enroll 
part a the balanced budget act of the bba mandated the prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible enrolled residents in skilled nursing facilities 
under pps  medicare pays skilled nursing facilities a fixed fee per patient per day for extended care services to patients  covering substantially all items and services furnished during such enrollee s stay 
such services and items include pharmacy services and prescription drugs 
we bill skilled nursing facilities based upon a negotiated fee schedule and are paid based on those contractual relationships 
we do not receive direct payment from medicare for patients covered under the medicare part a benefit 
we classify the revenues recognized from these payers as institutional healthcare providers 
federal legislation continues to focus on reducing medicare and medicaid program expenditures 
the deficit reduction act of  or dra  is intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately billion over five years 
among other things  the dra reduces certain bad debt payments to medicare skilled nursing facilities by percent for those individuals who are not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
it also strengthens asset transfer restrictions for people seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage 
this provision is expected to reduce payments to skilled nursing facilities by approximately million over five years fiscal years 
in addition  cms has proposed or finalized multiple rules decreasing both skilled nursing facilities pps payments and long term care hospital pps payments 
such decreases may directly impact the corporation s customers and their medicare reimbursement 
given the changing nature of these rules  we are unable at this time to fully evaluate the impact on our business 
any evaluation of budgeting  cost cutting  and financing of health care must also consider the new federal administration and the impact its proposed health care policies could have on any future cost considerations 

table of contents part b the mma also changed the medicare payment methodology and conditions for coverage of certain items of durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  and supplies dmepos under medicare part b 
the corporation provides some of these products to its nursing home customers 
the changes include  among other things  a new competitive bidding program 
beginning on january   only suppliers that are winning bidders will be eligible to provide services  at prices established as a result of the competitive bids  to medicare beneficiaries in the selected areas 
enteral nutrients  equipment and supplies  and oxygen equipment and supplies are among the categories of dmepos included in the first round of the competitive bidding process 
the corporation did not participate in the bidding process  however  it will still be able to sell products not in the categories described above that are otherwise reimbursed under medicare part b 
integrity medical supplies  llc  a recently acquired company  did participate in the bidding process and is awaiting the results of the bids 
cms intends to announce the payment amounts and to begin the contracting process with the bidders in june and to publicly announce the contracted suppliers in september the corporation will continue to evaluate whether it will participate in round of the bidding  which is not yet scheduled 
part d medicare part d provides coverage for prescription drugs that are not otherwise covered under medicare part a or part b for those beneficiaries that enroll 
under medicare part d  beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private commercial insurers who contract with cms or in a fallback plan offered on behalf of the government through a contractor  to the extent private entities fail to offer a plan in a given area  which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs collectively  part d plans 
part d plans include both plans providing the drug benefit on a stand alone basis and medicare advantage plans providing drug coverage as a supplement to an existing medical benefit under that medicare advantage plan 
medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from one part d plan to another  although cms provides various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies 
dually eligible residents in nursing centers generally are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary or an exception to the part d plan s formulary is granted 
cms reviews the formularies of part d plans and requires these formularies to include the types of drugs most commonly used by medicare beneficiaries 
cms also reviews the formulary exceptions criteria of the part d plans that provide for coverage of drugs determined by the part d plan to be medically appropriate for the enrollee  however there currently is not a separate formulary for long term care residents 
we obtain reimbursement for drugs we provide to enrollees of the given part d plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between us and the part d plan 
the medicare part d final rule prohibits part d plans from paying for drugs and services not specifically called for by the bba 
beginning in  cms will require part d sponsors to use pass through pricing  based on the price actually received by the pharmacy for drugs  in order to determine beneficiary cost sharing and drug reporting 
this change  and similar changes by cms aimed at ensuring administrative costs are absorbed by the pharmacy benefit manager pbm and not the government  may alter the way certain pbms negotiate prices with pharmacies 
currently  we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of this change in pricing definition on the corporation 
medicare part d does not alter federal reimbursement for residents of nursing centers whose stay at the nursing center is covered under medicare part a 
accordingly  medicare s fixed per diem payments to nursing centers under pps will continue to include a portion attributable to the expected cost of drugs provided to such residents 
we will  therefore  continue to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the nursing center in accordance with the terms of our agreements with each nursing center 

table of contents in june  cms released a report indicating that approximately million in medicare part d payments for prescription drugs  some dispensed by ltc pharmacies  were likely made incorrectly 
cms concluded many of the drugs  which were dispensed during part a skilled nursing facility stays  should have been included in per diem payments under medicare part a 
cms stated it will focus on ensuring such improper payments do not occur in the future 
we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of current and future federal initiatives aimed at eliminating these discrepancies 
in addition  we receive rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for undertaking certain activities that the manufacturers believe may increase the likelihood that we will dispense their products 
cms continues to question whether institutional pharmacies should be permitted to receive these access performance rebates from manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under medicare part d  but has not prohibited the receipt of such rebates 
cms defines these as rebates a manufacturer provides to long term care pharmacies that are designed to prefer  protect  or maintain that manufacturer s product selection by the long term care pharmacy or to increase the volume of that manufacturer s products that are dispensed by the pharmacy under its formulary 
cms  in  required pdps to have policies and systems in place as part of their drug utilization management programs to protect beneficiaries and reduce costs when long term care pharmacies receive incentives to move market share through access performance rebates 
the elimination or reduction of manufacturer rebates  if not offset by other reimbursement  could have an adverse effect on our business 
other on july   mippa of was enacted 
mippa cancels a reduction in medicare s payment rates for physicians services that went into effect on july  and extends other expiring provisions governing the medicare program 
it also increases payment rates for physician s services for  expands eligibility for low income benefits  and reduces payments to medicare advantage plans 
the various provisions that could impact our operations are as follows incentives for electronic prescribing providers who electronically prescribe e rx are eligible to receive bonus payments based on a percentage of medicare allowable charges through beginning in  penalty payments will become effective for providers who fail to use e rx 
low income subsidy the legislation eliminates the part d late enrollment penalty for low income beneficiaries and specifies that certain income and assets be disregarded in determining eligibility for the low income subsidy program in part d 
mippa also provides additional funds to federal and state entities to increase outreach efforts to encourage eligible individuals to enroll in those programs 
prompt pay beginning  long term care ltc pharmacies will be required to submit part d claims to pdp s no less than days but no more than days from the date the drugs are dispensed for reimbursement 
formularies this provision legislatively expands the list of covered part d drugs 
this provision also offers cms the authority to designate certain classes of drugs as having a protected status 
cms announced that it will maintain its current six protected classes policy antidepressants  antipsychotics  antiretrovirals  immunosuppresants  anticonvulsants  and antineoplastics 
these various provisions of mippa are currently being implemented through cms rules and regulations and are being incorporated into other health care related legislation 

table of contents medicaid the reimbursement rate for pharmacy services under medicaid is determined on a state by state basis subject to review by cms and applicable federal law 
although medicaid programs vary from state to state  they generally provide for the payment of certain pharmacy services  up to established limits  at rates determined in accordance with each state s regulations 
the federal medicaid statute specifies a variety of requirements that a state plan must meet  including the requirements related to eligibility  coverage for services  payment  and admissions 
for residents that are eligible for medicaid only  and are not dual eligibles covered under medicare part d  we bill the individual state medicaid program or in certain circumstances the state s designated managed care or other similar organizations 
federal regulations and the regulations of certain states establish upper limits for reimbursement of certain prescription drugs under medicaid 
in most states  pharmacy services are priced at the lower of usual and customary charges or cost  which generally is defined as a function of average wholesale price and may include a profit percentage plus a dispensing fee 
most states establish a fixed dispensing fee per prescription that is adjusted to reflect associated cost 
over the last several years  state medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms  principally higher discounts off average wholesale price levels  expansion of the number of medications subject to federal upper limit pricing  and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies 
in addition  effective october   cms promulgated new rules under the deficit reduction act of  or dra  changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the average wholesale price to of the lowest average manufacturer price  or amp 
although the use of an amp benchmark would have reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for certain generic pharmaceuticals  it did not take effect due to a december  federal district court injunction against cms prohibiting the agency from implementing the rule 
the outcome of the amp litigation is uncertain  and there can be no assurance that changes in reimbursement formula under the dra or future legislation or regulation will not have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
mippa delayed the possible use of amp in setting the federal upper limit fuls for multiple source drugs through september   and delayed public posting of amp data until october  the use of amp in fuls and public posting of amp data are currently on hold due to the injunction 
further  several current legislative proposals make significant changes to the amp and ful calculations and data 
it is unclear if and when these changes will be implemented and thus we cannot fully evaluate the potential impact on our business 
additionally  oig recently released a report comparing the relative pharmacy reimbursements amounts for select drugs under medicare part d and medicaid in select states 
the oig found that national reimbursement amounts were roughly equal for single source drugs  but that the medicaid pharmacy reimbursement amount for select multiple source drugs was percent higher than medicare part d reimbursement for those same drugs 
in addition  the report states that medicaid dispensing fees exceeded medicare part d dispensing fees for both single source and multiple source drugs by at least percent and percent  respectively 
the report repeatedly notes that these disparities would likely be remedied by the dra provisions related to amp that are not yet in use due to the aforementioned injunction 
we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of current and future federal initiatives aimed at eliminating these disparities 
further  the tax relief and health care act of modified several medicaid policies  including  among other things  reducing the limit on medicaid provider taxes from the current six percent to five and a half percent from january  through september  other average wholesale price  or awp  is a pricing benchmark published by first databank  inc in its blue book  that provides drug databases  content integration software  and drug reference products 
awp has been widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d drug reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers 
in  several pension funds brought an action against first databank and another healthcare provider alleging collusion to set awps for branded drugs 

table of contents on march   the court approved the settlement of the litigation 
pursuant to the settlement  first databank i adjusted its reporting of blue book awp for those prescription drugs approximately  national drug codes  or ndcs in number identified in the plaintiffs previously filed complaint by reducing the mark up factor utilized in connection with the calculation of the blue book awp data field to times the wholesale acquisition cost  or wac  or direct price for those prescription drugs that are on a mark up basis  and ii established a centralized data repository to facilitate reasonable access to discoverable material from first databank concerning its drug price reporting practices 
the price adjustment required under the provisions of the settlement agreement occurred on september  although some appeals are pending  the court has rejected most of these appeals 
independent of the settlement and on the same schedule as the blue book awp adjustment noted above  first databank intends to apply the same markup factor to all ndcs whose blue book awp is set based upon a markup to wac or direct price in excess of times wac 
first databank will also independently discontinue publishing the blue book awp data field for all drugs no later than two years following the date that the blue book awp adjustments noted above are implemented 
the corporation and the vast preponderance of the corporation s pdp s  third party insurance companies and its medicare part a customers have voluntarily agreed to adjust reimbursement so that pricing could not increase or decrease as a result of the changes to awp  however  the state medicaid programs have been unwilling to remain price neutral and accordingly the corporation is being reimbursed based on the adjusted awp 
as a result  we believe the awp settlement will adversely impact our revenues approximately million on an annual basis 
this exposure is primarily related to the states in which the corporation operates  who have refused to adjust their medicaid reimbursement 
the national association of chain drug stores and the national community pharmacists association  the industry trade groups  have filed lawsuits against several state medicaid programs to force the state medicaid programs to agree to price neutrality 
these cases are still pending 
as a result of political  economic  and regulatory influences  the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes 
we cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted  or what impact they may have on us 
the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
environmental matters in operating our facilities  historically we have not encountered any material difficulties effecting compliance with applicable pollution control laws 
no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are expected 
while we cannot predict the effect which any future legislation  regulations or interpretations may have upon our operations  we do not anticipate any changes regarding pollution control laws that would have a material adverse impact on the corporation

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should consider carefully the risks described below  together with all of the other information  in evaluating our company and our common stock 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and stock price 
risk factors relating to the pharmacy transaction the integration of the remaining pharmacy locations and systems infrastructure will be time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we will continue our information systems integration to one operating platform which will continue to be time consuming  may distract our management from our operations  may be disruptive to our customers and will be expensive  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be charged for services and products from our former parents at amounts greater than those charged prior to the pharmacy transaction and those charged by third parties 
before the pharmacy transaction  our business was part of two separate public companies 
our former parent companies performed many corporate functions at costs that are less than those that are presently being charged 
after the pharmacy transaction  amerisourcebergen continues to be our primary drug distributor under the prime vendor agreement and kindred provides information technology services under the information technology services agreement 
these agreements were entered into as part of the pharmacy transaction and have multi year terms 
during the terms of these agreements  we are not able to negotiate potentially better pricing and other more favorable terms with other vendors thus these existing agreements could negatively impact our results of operations  financial position and competitive position 
risk factors relating to our business future volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to access credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 
the global capital and credit markets have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval  characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these conditions could adversely affect the demand for our products and services and  therefore  reduce purchases by our customers  which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations  financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may limit our access to capital  and may also negatively affect our customers and our suppliers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms 
as a result  our customers needs and ability to purchase our products or services may decrease  and our suppliers may increase their prices  reduce their output or change their terms of sale 
if our customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  our customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us  and our suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms 
any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services  or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms  may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additionally  both state and federal government sponsored payers  as a result of budget deficits or reductions  may seek to reduce their health care expenditures by renegotiating their contracts with us 
any reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
declining economic conditions may also increase our costs 
economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents intense competition may erode our profit margins 
the distribution of pharmaceuticals to healthcare facilities is highly competitive 
in each geographic market  there are national  regional and local institutional pharmacies and numerous local retail pharmacies  which provide services comparable to those offered by our pharmacies and which may have greater financial and other resources than we do and may be more established in the markets they serve than we are 
we also compete against regional and local pharmacies that specialize in long term care 
many of our competitors have equal or greater resources and access to capital than the corporation 
in addition  local pharmacies have strong personal relationships with their customers 
because relatively few barriers to entry exist in the local markets we serve  we may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants 
consolidation within the institutional pharmacy industry may also lead to increased competition 
competitive pricing pressures may adversely affect our future operating revenue and profitability 
we compete based on innovation and service as well as price 
to attract new clients and retain existing clients  we must continually meet service expectations of our clients and customers 
we cannot be sure that we will continue to remain competitive with the service to our clients at our current levels of profitability 
if we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline  our business and financial results could be adversely affected we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers that may provide us with  among other things discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from institutional pharmacies  rebates based upon distributions of drugs from our institutional pharmacies  and administrative fees for managing rebate programs 
if several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  formulary fee programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums 
changes in existing laws or regulations or in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to any of these programs may materially adversely affect our business 
our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the loss of large multi facility customers 
we have a number of customers that own or operate numerous multi facilities in our institutional pharmacy segment 
in addition  our hospital segment revenues are primarily derived from one large multi facility customer 
if we are not able to continue these relationships or are only able to continue these relationships on less favorable terms than the ones currently in place  our operating revenues and results of operations would be materially impacted 
there can be no assurance that these customers will not terminate all or a portion of their contracts with the corporation 

table of contents if we fail to comply with complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations  we could suffer penalties  or be required to pay substantial damages or make significant changes to our operations 
we are subject to numerous federal and state regulations 
if we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties  including the loss of our licenses to operate our institutional pharmacies and our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 
as a consequence of the severe penalties we could face  we must devote significant operational and managerial resources to complying with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that we are substantially compliant with all existing statutes and regulations applicable to our business  different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality  or could require us to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business 
pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns 
unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products  whether or not scientifically justified  leading to product recalls  withdrawals or declining sales 
if we fail to or do not promptly withdraw pharmaceutical products upon a recall by a drug manufacturer  our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
legal and regulatory changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and or medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability 
both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates 
the sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including licensed bed capacity and occupancy rates of our customers  the number of drugs administered to patients  the mix of pharmaceuticals dispensed  whether the drugs are brand or generic  and the rates of reimbursement among payers 
changes in the number of drugs administered to patients  as well as payer mix among private pay  medicare and medicaid  in our customers facilities will significantly affect our profitability 
medicare part d the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of or mma included a major expansion of the medicare program with the addition of a prescription drug benefit under the new medicare part d program 
the continued impact of these regulations depends upon a variety of factors  including our ongoing relationships with the part d plans and the patient mix of our customers 
future modifications to the medicare part d program may reduce revenue and impose additional costs to the industry 
in addition  we cannot assure you that medicare part d and the regulations promulgated under medicare part d will not have a material adverse effect on our institutional pharmacy business 
risks related to manufacturer rebates our pharmacies receive rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for undertaking certain activities that the manufacturers believe may increase the likelihood that their respective products will be dispensed 
cms has questioned whether long term care pharmacies should be permitted to receive discounts  rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the medicare part d benefit 
cms requires plan sponsors to report prescription volume and prescription cost for long term care pharmacies 
as such  most plan sponsors require disclosure from us of discounts  rebates or other remuneration received from drug manufacturers 
it is possible that these disclosure requirements and others imposed by cms could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our business would be adversely affected if cms should take any action that has the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing the rebates that we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers 

table of contents changes in medicaid reimbursement in addition  effective october   cms promulgated new rules under the deficit reduction act of  or dra changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the average wholesale price to of the lowest average manufacturer price  or amp 
although the use of an amp benchmark would have reduced medicaid reimbursement rates for certain generic pharmaceuticals  it did not take effect due to a december  federal district court injunction against cms prohibiting the agency from implementing the rule 
the outcome of the amp litigation is uncertain 
we are unable to fully evaluate the potential impact until a final action is ultimately determined 
there can be no assurance that changes in reimbursement formula under the dra or future legislation or regulation will not have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of delayed use of amp in setting fuls for multiple source drugs through september   and delayed public posting of amp data until october  as stated above  the use of amp in fuls and public posting of amp data are currently on hold due to an injunction 
the settlement by first databank  inc on pricing benchmark may reduce reimbursement to us 
average wholesale price  or awp  is a pricing benchmark published by first databank  inc in its blue book  that provides drug databases  content integration software  and drug reference products 
awp has been widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d drug reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers 
in  several pension funds brought an action against first databank and another healthcare provider alleging collusion to set awps for branded drugs 
on march   the court approved the settlement of the litigation 
pursuant to the settlement  first databank i adjusted its reporting of blue book awp for those prescription drugs approximately  national drug codes  or ndcs in number identified in the plaintiffs previously filed complaint by reducing the mark up factor utilized in connection with the calculation of the blue book awp data field to times the wholesale acquisition cost  or wac  or direct price for those prescription drugs that are on a mark up basis  and ii established a centralized data repository to facilitate reasonable access to discoverable material from first databank concerning its drug price reporting practices 
the price adjustment required under the provisions of the settlement agreement occurred on september  independent of the settlement and on the same schedule as the blue book awp adjustment noted above  first databank intends to apply the same markup factor to all ndcs whose blue book awp is set based upon a markup to wac or direct price in excess of times wac 
first databank will also independently discontinue publishing the blue book awp data field for all drugs no later than two years following the date that the blue book awp adjustments noted above are implemented 
the corporation and the vast preponderance of the corporation s pdp s  third party insurance companies and its medicare part a customers have voluntarily agreed to adjust reimbursement so that pricing could not increase or decrease as a result of the changes to awp  however  the state medicaid programs have been unwilling to remain price neutral and accordingly the corporation is being reimbursed based on the adjusted awp 
as a result  we believe the awp settlement will adversely impact our revenues approximately million on an annual basis 
this exposure is limited to the states who are refusing to adjust prices at this time 
currently  the national association of chain drug stores and the national community pharmacists association  the industry trade groups  have filed lawsuits against several state medicaid programs to force the state medicaid programs to agree to price neutrality 
these cases are still pending 
as a result of political  economic  and regulatory influences  the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes 
we cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted  or what impact they may have on us 

table of contents the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
adverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon the corporation s business 
the corporation may from time to time become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to  among other things  intellectual property disputes  professional liability and employee related matters  as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment and information on allegations of billing irregularities and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits  third parties or other sources 
the health care industry is subject to substantial federal and state government regulation and audit 
legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the corporation s reputation with customers  which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position 
if we or our customers fail to comply with medicare and medicaid regulations  we may be subjected to penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in these programs 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated 
these programs are also subject to frequent and substantial changes 
if we or our customers facilities fail to comply with applicable reimbursement laws and regulations  whether purposely or inadvertently  our reimbursement under these programs could be curtailed or reduced and our eligibility to continue to participate in these programs could be adversely affected 
federal or state governments may also impose other penalties on us for failure to comply with the applicable reimbursement regulations 
failure by our customers to comply with these or future laws and regulations could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these customers and their residents 
we do not believe that we have taken any actions that could subject us to material penalties under these rules and regulations 
among these laws is the federal anti kickback statute 
this statute prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying any remuneration with the intent to refer  or to arrange for the referral or order of  services or items payable under a federal healthcare program 
courts have interpreted this statute broadly 
violations of the anti kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to  for each violation or imprisonment  civil money penalties of up to  per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
this law impacts the relationships that we may have with potential referral sources 
we have a variety of relationships with potential referral sources  including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities with which we have contracted to provide pharmacy services 
the office of inspector general at hhs  or oig  among other regulatory agencies  is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud  abuse or waste 
the oig carries out this responsibility through a nationwide program of audits  investigations and inspections 
the oig has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
while we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors  certain of our current arrangements may not qualify for safe harbor protection 
failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
it cannot be assured that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 

table of contents the anti kickback statute and similar state laws and regulations are expansive 
we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality  or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
if we fail to comply with the anti kickback statute or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities  and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
in addition  we are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted  what form such legislation or regulations may take or their impact 
continuing government and private efforts to contain healthcare costs may reduce our future revenue 
we could be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of government and private payers to contain healthcare costs 
to reduce healthcare costs  payers seek to lower reimbursement rates  limit the scope of covered services and negotiate reduced or capped pricing arrangements 
while many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement  we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payer programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs 
any changes that lower reimbursement rates under medicare  medicaid or private pay programs could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues 
our operating margins may continue to be under pressure because of deterioration in reimbursement  changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases  if any  in payments by third party payers 
healthcare reform could adversely affect the liquidity of our customers which would have an adverse effect on their ability to make timely payments to us for our products and services 
healthcare reform and legislation may have an adverse effect on our business through decreasing funds available to our customers 
limitations or restrictions on medicare and medicaid payments to our customers could adversely impact the liquidity of our customers  resulting in their inability to pay us  or to timely pay us  for our products and services 
this inability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the changing us healthcare industry and increasing enforcement environment may negatively impact our business 
our products and services are part of the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending 
these changes include an increased reliance on managed care  cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base and consolidation of competitors  suppliers and customers 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these potential changes  such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing  healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare providers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 
if we are unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare environment  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents further  both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the healthcare area 
the oig and the us department of justice have  from time to time  established national enforcement initiatives  targeting all providers of a particular type  that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
in addition  under the federal false claims act  private parties have the right to bring qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false claims for payments to the government 
a number of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions 
we do not believe that we have taken any actions that could subject us to material penalties under these provisions 
further consolidation of managed care organizations and other third party payers may adversely affect our profits 
managed care organizations and other third party payers have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services 
consequently  the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the us population are increasingly served by a small number of managed care organizations 
these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services 
in addition  private payers  including managed care payers  increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures 
to the extent that these organizations terminate us as a preferred provider  engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider or demand discounted fee structures  our profitability and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
possible changes in or our failure to satisfy our manufacturers rebate programs could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently earn rebates from certain manufacturers of pharmaceutical products for meeting tiered market share and purchase volumes 
there can be no assurance that pharmaceutical manufacturers will continue to offer these rebates or that we will continue to satisfy the tiered market share and purchase volumes 
a decrease in the volume of prescriptions dispensed or an increase in the generic dispensing rate could affect our ability to satisfy our manufacturers rebate programs 
the termination of such programs or our failure to satisfy the tiered market share and volumes may have an adverse affect on our cost of goods sold and our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
if we or our customers fail to comply with licensure requirements  laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud or other applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
our pharmacies must be licensed by the state board of pharmacy in the state in which they operate 
many states also regulate out of state pharmacies that are delivering prescription products to patients or residents in their states 
the failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely impact the operation of our business 
in addition  the healthcare facilities we service are also subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations and are required to be licensed in the states in which they are located 
the failure by these healthcare facilities to comply with these or future regulations or to obtain or renew any required licenses could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these facilities and their residents and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws  many of the regulations applicable to us  including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers  and rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts 
they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations 
these changes may be material and may require the expenditure of material funds to implement 
we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense 
federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections  citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments  terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs  bans on medicare and medicaid payments and fines 
if we or our customers fail to comply with the extensive applicable laws and regulations  we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement  suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations regardless of whether we have actually been involved in any violations or wrong doing 
federal and state medical privacy regulations may increase the costs of operations and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions 
we must comply with extensive federal and state requirements regarding the transmission and retention of health information 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations  referred to as hipaa  was enacted to ensure that employees can retain and at times transfer their health insurance when they change jobs  to enhance the privacy and security of personal health information and to simplify healthcare administrative processes 
hipaa requires the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information 
failure to comply with hipaa could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources  may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
we have made and anticipate that we may continue to make acquisitions of  investments in and strategic alliances with complementary businesses to enable us to capitalize on our position in the geographic markets in which we operate and to expand our businesses in new geographic markets 
at any particular time  we may be in various stages of assessment  discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances  not all of which  if any  will be consummated 
our growth plans rely  in part  on the successful completion of future acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful  our business would suffer 
we intend to make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate or required by applicable securities laws and regulations 
acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  additional operating losses  amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies  and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel and information systems  or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings  diversion of management s time from existing operations  potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies  inaccurate assessment of assets and liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws  increases in our indebtedness and a limitation on our ability to access additional capital when needed  and failure to operate acquired facilities profitably or to achieve improvements in their financial performance 

table of contents if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement  we could be subject to severe sanctions  including stipulated monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs 
we are subject to the terms of a cia  entered into between the oig and pharmerica ltc on march  in june  the oig commenced an administrative action against pharmerica ltc  including its subsidiary pharmerica drug systems  inc  or pdsi 
the oig alleged that pdsi s december acquisition of hollins manor i  llc  or hollins  from hcmf corporation  or hcmf  violated the anti kickback provisions of the social security act 
the hollins acquisition predated the acquisition of pharmerica ltc in by amerisourcebergen s predecessor 
hollins was an institutional pharmacy that had been established to serve the nursing homes then operated by hcmf 
as part of the settlement  in which pharmerica ltc and pdsi expressly denied wrongdoing  pharmerica ltc paid million to the hhs and entered into a five year cia 
in turn  the oig provided pharmerica ltc and its subsidiaries with a full release for the conduct covered by the administrative action  including an agreement not to pursue their exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs 
under the cia  pharmerica ltc agreed to continue its  and the corporation as of the closing of the pharmacy transaction has agreed to maintain a comprehensive compliance program  which includes a corporate compliance officer  a corporate compliance committee  a code of ethics and business conduct  written policies and procedures  educational and training initiatives  review and disciplinary procedures  a confidential disclosure program  an ineligible persons screening program and internal audit and review procedures  all designed to promote compliance with applicable laws  including federal healthcare program requirements  and the promotion of ethical business practices 
pharmerica ltc is also subject to extensive reporting requirements under the cia  including annual reports describing pharmerica ltc s compliance activities  notices of any government investigations or legal proceedings  overpayments received from federal healthcare programs and changes in pharmacy locations and new business units 
the term of the cia is five years and it ends on march  pharmerica ltc is required to comply fully and timely with all of the cia requirements 
failure to do so may lead to the imposition of stipulated penalties  including substantial monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
any such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain  rapidly process  analyze  and manage data to facilitate the dispensing of prescription and non prescription pharmaceuticals in accordance with physician orders and deliver those medications to patients and long term care residents on a timely basis  to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  and to process payments to suppliers 
our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or if they fail for an extended period of time 
we purchase a significant portion of our pharmaceutical products from one supplier amerisourcebergen 
we are required to purchase of our pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen  one of our former parent companies  pursuant to the prime vendor agreement 
if the prime vendor agreement is terminated or amerisourcebergen fails to deliver products in accordance with the prime vendor agreement  there can be no assurance that our operations would not be disrupted or that we could obtain the products at similar cost or at all 
in this event  failure to satisfy our customers requirements would result in defaults under these customer contracts subjecting us to damages and the potential termination of those contracts 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  under the terms of the prime vendor agreement  we are unable to negotiate potentially better pricing and other terms with other drug distributors which could negatively impact our competitive position 

table of contents prescription volumes may decline  and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted  if products are withdrawn from the market or if increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs result in utilization decreases 
we dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs from our institutional pharmacies 
these volumes are the basis for our net revenues and profitability 
when increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases  physicians may cease writing or reduce the numbers of prescriptions written for these drugs 
additionally  negative press regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs 
on occasion  products are withdrawn by their manufacturers 
in cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs  our volumes  net revenues  profitability and cash flows may decline 
we could be required to record a material non cash charge to income if our recorded intangible assets are impaired  or if we shorten intangible asset useful lives 
we have million of recorded intangible assets  net  on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  our intangible assets primarily represent the value of client relationships that were recorded from acquisitions prior to july  and upon our acquisition of pharmerica ltc along with subsequent acquisitions in and under current accounting rules  intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
these assets may become impaired with the loss of significant clients 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted pre tax expected future cash flows from the lowest appropriate asset grouping  we would be required to record a non cash impairment charge to our statement of operations in the amount the carrying value of these assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in addition  while the intangible assets may not be impaired  the useful lives are subject to continual assessment  taking into account historical and expected losses of relationships that were in the base at time of acquisition 
this assessment may result in a reduction of the remaining weighted average useful life of these assets  resulting in potentially significant increases to non cash amortization expense that is charged to our consolidated statement of operations 
an intangible asset impairment charge  or a reduction of amortization lives  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for the year ended december   we incurred a pre tax impairment charge of million or earnings per diluted share as a result of a review of our lost customer base of pre pharmacy transaction assets 
we primarily obtain our information services from one provider 
failure to provide information services  in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our services  which could damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our growth 
we obtain substantially all of our information services from kindred  one of our former parent companies  pursuant to the it services agreement 
kindred is not in the business of providing comprehensive information technology outsourcing services to third parties and does not have any significant prior experience providing comprehensive outsourcing information technology services for any third party 
if kindred or other third parties upon whom we are dependent fail to devote sufficient time and resources to us or if their performance is substandard  our business may be harmed 
any delays  malfunctions  inefficiencies or interruptions in these products or services could adversely affect the reliability or operation of our business  which could cause us to experience difficulty retaining current customers and attracting new customers 
this could result in our failure to satisfy our customers requirements or comply with certain of our financial or regulatory reporting requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents we are highly dependent on our senior management team and our pharmacy professionals 
we are highly dependent upon the members of our senior management and our pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals 
our business is managed by a small number of senior management personnel 
if we were unable to retain these persons  we might be materially adversely affected due to the limited pool of senior management personnel with significant experience in our industry 
accordingly  we believe we could experience significant difficulty in replacing key management personnel 
we expect that any employment contracts we enter into with our key management personnel will be subject to termination without cause by either party 
moreover  although the majority of the members of our senior management team have significant experience in the industry  they will need time to fully assess and understand our business and operations 
we can offer no assurance how long these members of senior management will choose to remain with us 
in addition  our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals 
competition for qualified pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals is intense 
the loss of pharmacy personnel or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified pharmacy professionals could adversely affect our business 
although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements for pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals  our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
risk factors relating to ownership of our common stock and our senior secured credit facility the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including  without limitation the following as a result of the risk factors listed in this document  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  for reasons unrelated to our specific performance  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions  or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance  regulatory changes that could impact our business or that of our customers  and general economic and industry conditions 
in addition  when the market price of a company s common stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company 
a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of delaware law as well as certain provisions of agreements entered into in connection with the pharmacy transaction could delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders favor 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  among other things prohibit stockholder action except at an annual or special meeting 
specifically  this means our stockholders will be unable to act by written consent  regulate how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders 
advance notice of such proposals or nominations will be required  regulate how special meetings of stockholders may be called 
our stockholders will not have the right to call special meetings  
table of contents authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without stockholder approval 
under this authority  our board of directors could adopt a rights plan which could ensure continuity of management by rendering it more difficult for a potential acquirer to obtain control of us  and require an affirmative vote of the holders of three quarters or more of the combined voting power of our common stock entitled to vote in the election of our directors in order for the stockholders to amend our bylaws 
in addition  because we have not chosen to be exempt from section of the delaware general corporation law dgcl  this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that may be favorable 
section provides that unless board and or shareholder approval is obtained pursuant to the requirements of the statute  persons that acquire  or are affiliated with a person that acquires  more than of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation  including by merger  consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares  for a three year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than of the corporation s outstanding voting stock 
acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances we may make in the future may need to be financed by borrowings from the senior secured credit facility for which funds may not be made available by certain participants 
we have made and anticipate that we may continue to make acquisitions of  investments in and strategic alliances with complementary businesses to enable us to capitalize on our position in the geographic markets in which we operate and to expand our business in new geographic markets 
our growth plans rely  in part  on the successful completion of future acquisitions 
at any particular time  we may need to finance such acquisitions and strategic alliances by borrowings from our senior secured credit facility 
the financial markets are very volatile and certain participants in our senior secured credit facility may not be able to participate in funding their commitments under the revolving line of credit 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the financing  our business would be impacted 
we are exposed to interest rate changes 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had outstanding debt of million  all of which was subject to variable rates of interest 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
we have indebtedness  which restricts our ability to pay dividends and has a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity 
we have million in indebtednesses outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
the credit agreement contains customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  including a maximum of debt to ebitda ratio 
the senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios 
the senior secured credit facility limits our ability to declare and pay dividends or other distributions on our shares of common stock 
if our lenders permit us to declare dividends  the dividend amounts  if any  will be determined by our board of directors  which will consider a number of factors  including our financial condition  capital requirements  funds generated from operations  future business prospects  applicable contractual restrictions and any other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
the amount of this outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends and to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditure and acquisition purposes 
a significant portion of our cash flows will be dedicated to debt service and will be unavailable for investment  capital expenditures or other operating expenses 

table of contents as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we do not generate or are unable to borrow sufficient amounts of cash on satisfactory terms to meet these needs  we may need to seek to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  sell assets  curtail discretionary capital expenditures or seek additional capital 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources  and financial position 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by our financial results and we do not anticipate paying any distributions in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that future earnings will be used principally to support operations and finance the growth of our business 
thus  we do not intend to pay dividends or other cash distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
see dividend policy 
we entered into a senior secured credit facility providing for both term and revolving credit borrowings 
our ability to make payments on our existing and future debt and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is largely subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  legislative and other factors that are beyond our control 
cost containment and lower reimbursement levels relative to increases in cost by third party payers  including federal and state governments  could have a significant negative impact on our business and on our cash flows 
our operating margins continue to be under pressure because of continuing regulatory scrutiny and growth in our operating expenses  such as product and labor costs

table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring annual results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operations  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage and fixed charges ratios and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation used in this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the items excluded from adjusted ebitda but included in the calculation of the corporation s reported net income are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance

general pharmacy transaction the corporation was formed on october  by kindred and amerisourcebergen for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by the master agreement dated october   as amended 
pursuant to the master agreement  kindred and amerisourcebergen  through the pharmacy transaction  combined their respective institutional pharmacy businesses  kps and pharmerica ltc  into a new  stand alone  publicly traded company 
the pharmacy transaction was consummated on july  under the terms of the pharmacy transaction  on the closing date  each of kps and pharmerica ltc borrowed million as mutually agreed upon by kindred and amerisourcebergen and used such proceeds to fund a one time  tax free cash distribution in that amount to their respective parent companies 
following the cash distributions  kindred spun off to its stockholders all of the outstanding stock of kps and amerisourcebergen spun off to its stockholders all of the outstanding stock of pharmerica ltc 
immediately thereafter  separate wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporation were merged with and into kps and pharmerica ltc with kps and pharmerica ltc as the surviving entities of the mergers  and  as a result  kps and pharmerica ltc became wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporation 
the corporation issued million shares of its common stock in the mergers see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
immediately following such spin offs and mergers  the stockholders of kindred and amerisourcebergen each owned of the outstanding common stock of the corporation 
the shares of the corporation s common stock held by kindred and amerisourcebergen prior to the pharmacy transaction were cancelled  and neither retained any ownership of the outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation 
the pharmacy transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with kps treated as the accounting acquirer 
under the purchase method of accounting  the deemed purchase price was allocated to the underlying tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based upon their respective fair values with any excess deemed purchase price allocated to goodwill 
see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
prior to the closing of the pharmacy transaction  the corporation had no assets or liabilities and conducted no business activity 
prior to the closing of the pharmacy transaction  the corporation s business was operated as separate businesses of two different public companies  kindred and amerisourcebergen 

table of contents reporting entity the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k as of december  and and for the years ended december   and reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the corporation  which during the first seven months of  kps was a wholly owned subsidiary of kindred 
as discussed above  the pharmacy transaction was accounted for as an acquisition by kps of pharmerica ltc with kps being considered the accounting acquirer 
as a result  the historical financial statements of kps have become the historical financial statements of the corporation 
the results of pharmerica ltc are included in the results of operations of the corporation beginning august  accordingly  except as otherwise discussed below  this management s discussion and analysis reflects the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the corporation at december   and and historically of kps on a stand alone basis for all periods prior to august  the corporation s business and industry trends the corporation is an institutional pharmacy services company  which services healthcare facilities and provides management pharmacy services to hospitals 
the corporation is the second largest institutional pharmacy services company in the united states 
the corporation operates institutional pharmacies in states 
the corporation s customers are typically institutional healthcare providers  such as nursing centers  assisted living facilities  hospitals and other long term alternative care settings 
the corporation is generally the primary source of supply of pharmaceuticals to its customers 
the corporation also provides pharmacy management services to hospitals in the united states 
the institutional pharmacy services business is highly competitive 
competition is a significant factor that can impact the corporation s financial results 
in each geographic market  there are national  regional and local institutional pharmacies that provide services comparable to those offered by the corporation s pharmacies 
these pharmacies may have greater financial and other resources than we do and may be more established in the markets they serve than we are 
the corporation also competes against regional and local pharmacies that specialize in the highly fragmented long term care markets 
in the future some of the corporation s customers may seek to in source the provision of pharmaceuticals to patients in their facilities by establishing an internal pharmacy 
a variety of factors are affecting the institutional pharmacy industry 
with an aging population and the extension of drug coverage to a greater number of individuals through medicare part d  the consumption of pharmaceuticals by residents of long term care facilities is likely to increase in the future 
in addition  individuals are expected to enter assisted living facilities  independent living facilities and continuing care retirement communities at increasing rates 
under medicare part d  eligible individuals may choose to enroll in various medicare part d plans to receive prescription drug coverage 
each medicare part d plan determines the formulary for the long term care residents enrolled in its plan 
accordingly  institutional pharmacies must follow each part d plan s formulary  reimbursement and administrative processes for the long term care residents they serve 
institutional pharmacies have expanded their formularies to accommodate various formularies of key part d plans 
institutional pharmacies may experience increased administrative burdens and costs owing to the greater complexity of the requirements for drug reimbursement 
medicare part d also requires increased choices for patients with respect to complex drug categories and therapeutic interchange opportunities 
institutional pharmacies may realize increased revenue by providing long term care residents with specialized services in these areas 
continued industry consolidation may also impact the dynamics of the institutional pharmacy market 
in addition  our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals 
competition for qualified pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals is strong 
the loss of pharmacy personnel or the inability to attract  retain or motivate sufficient numbers of qualified pharmacy professionals could adversely affect our business 
although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements for pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals in the past  our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the corporation s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and with the corporation s independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to critical accounting estimates 
the table of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the corporation s accounting policies that require estimates 
management believes that of the significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the corporation 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
our sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the assumptions listed based upon the actual results of the corporation for the year ended december   and the actual diluted shares 
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from prescription drug plans pdp s under medicaid part d  long term care institutions  the respective state medicaid programs  private payers and third party insurance companies 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flow 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of our receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
in addition  certain drugs dispensed are subject to being returned and the responsible paying party is due back a credit for such returns 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheet at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
our quarterly provision for doubtful accounts included in our statements of operations was as follows dollars in millions amount of revenues march june september december march june september december march june september december includes the million change in estimate to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the pharmacy transaction 
assumptions approach used the largest components of bad debts in our accounts receivable relate to the accounts for which private payers are responsible which we refer to as private and other  accounts for which our customers from long term care institutions are responsible for under medicare part a and owe us for the drug component of their patients stay at their respective institution  third party  medicare part d  and medicaid accounts that have been denied 
we attempt to collect the private and other accounts through various efforts for which the patient is the responsible party 
we attempt to collect payments due from long term care institutions through billing and collecting in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
we attempt to collect from third party  medicare part d and medicaid accounts by obtaining the appropriate documentation and direct discussions with the payors 
in all cases  the drugs have been dispensed 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  perform up front adjudication prior to dispensing the product  billing and follow up with third party payers  billing and follow up with long term care institutions  utilization of collection agencies  and other legal processes 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor and review trends by payer classification along with the composition of our aging accounts receivable 
this review is focused primarily on trends in private and other payer  pdp s  dual eligible co payments  historic payment patterns of long term care institutions  and monitoring respective credit risks 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivables  denial trends by payer types  payment patterns by payer types  subsequent cash collections  and current events that may impact payment patterns of our long term care institution customers 
the following table shows our institutional pharmacy revenue days outstanding reflected in our institutional pharmacy net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated march june september december sensitivity analysis if our provision as a percent of institutional revenue increases  our after tax income would decline by approximately million or per diluted share 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
our estimates may be impacted by economic conditions  success in collections at the regional business offices  payer mix and trends in federal and state regulations

the corporation considers recent industry trends  changes in reimbursement sources and procedures  age of receivables and recent collection history 
in september  as part of the analysis described above  the corporation recorded in selling  general and administrative a change in accounting estimate to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by million  resulting in loss per diluted share impact of 
the change in accounting estimate of million representing an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is related to the acquired receivables of pharmerica ltc as of july   and is unrelated to the accounts receivable and revenue of kps

assumptions approach used we recognize revenues at the time services are provided or products are delivered 
a significant portion of our revenues are billed to pdps under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  long term care institutions  third party insurance companies  and private payers 
some claims are electronically adjudicated through online processing at the point the prescription is dispensed such that our operating system is automatically updated with the actual amount to be reimbursed 
as a result  our revenues and the associated receivables are based upon the actual reimbursement to be received 
for claims that are adjudicated on line and are rejected or otherwise denied upon submission  the corporation provides contractual allowances based upon historical trends  contractual reimbursement terms and other factors which may impact ultimate reimbursement 
amounts are adjusted to actual reimbursed amounts based upon cash receipts 
co payments for our services can be applicable under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  and certain third party payers and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are provided 
co payments under the medicaid programs and third party plans are generally billed to the responsible party as part of our normal billing procedures which are subject to normal collection procedures 
under medicare part d  co payments related to institutional residents who are both medicare and medicaid eligible are due from the responsible party for up to the first thirty days of a beneficiary s stay in a skilled nursing facility subsequent to which the pdp s are responsible for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  including state mandated return policies under various medicaid programs  we accept returns of medications and issue credit memorandums to the applicable payer 
product returns are processed in the period returned 
we estimate an amount for expected returns based on historical trends 
our hospital pharmacy management revenues represent contractually defined management fees and the reimbursement of costs associated with the direct operations of hospital pharmacies  and are primarily comprised of personnel costs 
sensitivity analysis if our reimbursement declined or was negatively impacted  the negative impact on net income would be million or per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item inventory and cost of drugs dispensed we have inventory located at each of our institutional pharmacy locations 
the inventory consists of prescription drugs  over the counter products and intravenous solutions 
our inventory relating to controlled substances is maintained on a manually prepared perpetual system to the extent required by the drug enforcement agency 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic system  through the performance of quarterly physical inventories 
at december  and  our inventory on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows dollars in millions our annualized inventory turns were as follows march june september december we receive rebates on purchases from various vendors and suppliers 
rebates included in our statements of operations were as follows dollars in millions march june september december total please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our inventory 
assumptions approach used our inventory is maintained on a first in  first out lower of cost or market basis 
our controlled prescription drugs are maintained on a perpetual inventory basis to the extent required by the drug enforcement agency 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic basis 
we perform quarterly inventory counts at all locations with the use of our personnel and the use of third party inventory count teams under our supervision 
we perform quarterly inventory counts in the third month of each quarter 
all inventory counts are reconciled to the balance sheet account and differences are adjusted through cost of goods sold 
in addition  we record an amount of potential returns of prescription drugs based on historical rates of returns 
we account for rebates and other incentives received from vendors and suppliers  relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory  as a reduction to cost of goods sold and inventory 
we consider these rebates to represent product discounts  and as a result  the rebates are capitalized as a reduction of product cost and relieved through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory 
sensitivity analysis actual inventory counts may include estimates based on amounts that may be dispensed from an open container 
in addition  items are reviewed for potential obsolescence 
a error rate in the count of prescription drugs in inventory would negatively impact net income million  or per diluted share 
if our rebates received were to be reduced by  the effect on net income for the year ended december  would have been a decrease of million  or per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item goodwill  other intangible assets and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies

as a part of the august  institutional pharmacy business acquisition  we have a contingent consideration liability of million 
this amount is not to exceed million in the form of a contingent consideration to be paid at the end of a three year period based upon the cumulative achievement of certain financial performance measures 
assumptions approach used we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment test using a fair value approach 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the purchase price of acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are determined by management based upon established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
the ultimate decision of allocations are that of management 
we assess for the potential impairment of tangible assets and long lived assets recorded on the corporation s balance sheet whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of million related to finite lived intangible assets resulting in a loss per dilutive share impact of 
the impairment  which related to the institutional pharmacy segment  was incurred when the reporting unit experienced a higher than expected loss of licensed beds 
see note to our financial statements for further disclosures of the impairment charge 
sensitivity analysis we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of december    and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
our estimate of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 
as it relates to the contingent consideration liability  if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record a charge as acquisition costs to the consolidated statement of operations 
our estimate of fair value of the liability is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 
as these facts and circumstance change  our estimate will be adjusted through the income statement 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon the corporation s annual taxable income or loss for each respective accounting period 
the corporation recognizes an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
the corporation also recognizes as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions  including the impact of valuation allowances our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions 
for an identified uncertain tax position to qualify for benefit recognition  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained on its technical merits if challenged by relevant taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort 
if an uncertain position does not meet this recognition threshold based on our analysis of applicable tax law  we establish a liability for the realized  but unrecognized tax benefit 
as of december   the corporation has a million liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits for us federal and state tax jurisdictions 
the corporation records accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
we recognize the benefit for an uncertain tax position we have taken upon any one of the following conditions the recognition threshold is met due to changes in facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date  the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our accounting for income taxes 
assumptions approach used the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the corporation s financial statements if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether the position has met this recognition threshold  the corporation assumes that the appropriate taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the amount of benefit recognized in the corporation s financial statements for a tax position meeting the recognition threshold is determined by a measurement of the largest amount of benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
with respect to the net operating loss carryforwards  the corporation considers all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
this includes an analysis of the statutory carryforward available under law  anticipated future income or loss  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the cumulative weight of evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net operating losses will not be realized  a full or partial valuation allowance will be recognized based upon the qualitative and quantitative evidence examined 
for the year ended december   the corporation recorded a tax benefit of million per diluted share for valuation allowance releases related to the adoption of an internal legal entity restructuring plan 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  the corporation believes that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize certain historic state net operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had previously been provided 
sensitivity analysis our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by million as of december   including the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced federal taxable income and we expect to generate taxable income in future years 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
however  we do have subsidiaries with a history of tax losses in certain state jurisdictions and  based upon those historical tax losses and current expected results  we assumed that the subsidiaries would not be profitable in the future for those states tax purposes unless a strong earnings history existed apart from an identifiable operational condition no longer present 
if our assertion regarding the future profitability of those subsidiaries was incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated by the amount of the valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments we would incur additional tax payments for plus the applicable penalties and interest 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for stock based compensation on july   the corporation adopted the pharmerica corporation omnibus incentive plan omnibus plan under which the corporation is authorized to grant equity based and other awards to its employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the corporation has reserved  shares of its common stock for awards to be granted under the omnibus plan plus  shares issued for substitute equity awards for employees of kps and pharmerica ltc whose awards were cancelled or forfeited upon the consummation of the pharmacy transaction 
the compensation committee has granted stock based compensation awards with respect to  common shares under the omnibus plan 
after consideration of forfeitures   shares remain available for grant at december  the corporation s compensation committee administers the omnibus plan and has the authority to determine the recipient of the awards  the types of awards  the number of shares covered and the terms and conditions of the awards 
the omnibus plan allows for grants of incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  deferred shares  performance awards  including cash bonus awards  and other stock based awards 
on july   the corporation s stockholders approved an amendment to the omnibus plan to provide the compensation committee with increased flexibility to use non gaap measures to measure performance  including the ability to exclude from the performance measures certain items or charges related to an event or occurrence which the compensation committee determines should be excluded  in accordance with the performance criteria of performance awards granted pursuant to the omnibus plan 
the compensation committee establishes long term and short term incentive programs under the omnibus plan 
in connection with the corporation s annual meeting of stockholders  the stockholders of the corporation approved and adopted the amended and restated omnibus plan to preserve preferential tax treatment as qualified performance based compensation under section m of the code 
unvested stock option and restricted shares of kindred and amerisourcebergen common stock held by our employees who were formerly pharmerica ltc or kps employees were replaced with stock based awards of the corporation s common stock  which will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the forfeited kindred or amerisourcebergen stock based awards 
our stock based compensation for the years ended december    and included in our results of operations was as follows dollars in millions please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our accounting for stock based compensation 
assumptions approach used in connection with the granting of shares under the omnibus plan  each option generally vests in four equal annual installments and to have a term of seven years 
the restricted stock will generally vest  in full  upon the three year anniversary of the date of grant  thus stressing the retentive aspect of these awards 
the restricted stock units generally vest in two equal annual installments 
the full vesting of performance share units is based upon a target amount of the corporation s earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or adjusted ebitda performance  which will reinforce the importance of achieving the corporation s profitability objectives 
the performance period for the performance share units is generally a three year period 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted during   and using the black scholes merton option valuation model bsm 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting periods of three to four years 
the stock options that were granted under the omnibus plan vest on each grant anniversary date over four years of continued employment 
restricted stock awards vest at the third anniversary 
the weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted by us during   and were   and  respectively 
the following table shows the weighted average assumptions we used to develop the fair value estimates under our stock options valuation model for   and and the paragraphs below this table summarizes each assumption expected volatility range risk free interest rate range expected dividends average expected term years fair value per share of stock options granted based on the black sholes merton model dollars weighted average fair value of options granted during the year in millions the corporation aggregates individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
we have stratified our employee population into two groups i insiders  who are the section filers under sec rules  and ii non insiders  who are the rest of the employee population 
volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
as the corporation has no history prior to july   we have used historical peer group volatility 
we also consider how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
the peer group utilized consisted of fourteen companies in the same or similar industries as the corporation 
sensitivity analysis the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant 
changes in our volatility estimates can materially affect the fair values of our stock option grants 
if our stock based compensation expense during was higher  our after tax income would decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used in addition  management uses the mean in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
the corporation estimates pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have estimated pre vesting option forfeitures and recorded share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised 
the corporation calculated an expected term using management s estimate of option exercises 
the majority of the corporation s stock options are on a graded vesting schedule 
the corporation estimates the value of awards with graded vesting by treating each vesting tranche as a separate award 
management has determined to value each tranche of the awards separately utilizing a multiple fair value method

table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring quarterly results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operations  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage ratio and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation as this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the items excluded from adjusted ebitda but included in the calculation of the corporation s reported net income are significant components of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance
