in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
the company s financial statements are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 
overview the company s business operations consist of the manufacturing and marketing  researching and developing of cotton base medical dressings and medical disposables  as well as consumer products 
the company has ten wholly owned operating subsidiaries and three joint ventures  all located in china 
the company has established several integrated manufacturing and processing lines for its core products 
the company s product offerings include medical dressings and medical disposables  which consist of medical care and wound care  as well as purcotton products  spunlace  natural cotton nonwoven products 
the company manufactures its products in china and sells its medical dressings and medical disposables both in china and abroad  with europe  the united states and japan serving as the top three markets  and sells its purcotton jumbo rolls in both china and abroad  while it sells purcotton finished consumer products mainly in china 
the company s business operations winner medical s present business operations commenced february and involve the manufacture and marketing of its products primarily out of its facilities in china 
the company generates revenue through domestic china and foreign sales of a variety of medical dressings and medical disposables  which include medical care and wound care  such as gauze  wound dressings  disposable drapes  surgical gowns  face masks  cotton balls  etc 
and a non woven fabric made from natural cotton products  that is  purcotton products  which consist of dry and wet tissues  beauty pads  baby wears  cleansing wipes  etc 
the company has integrated manufacturing lines that provides its clients with the ability to procure certain products from a single supplier 
in the developed countries  the company provides its customers with its specialized design  manufacturing and packaging services 
when the company works on this basis  its clients are able to select the design  size  type and scale of the products the company manufactures for them 
the company sells its own winner medical brand products in developing countries and regions including china  the middle east  south america  africa  and southeast asia 
the company builds its purcotton finished products by its own marketing and sales efforts in the chinese marketplace 
each store contains four types of purcotton branded personal products and healthcare supplies 
the main distribution channels are chain stores purcotton stores  on line sales and wholesale to large customers 
however  these distribution channels will require higher levels of capital expenditure  such as for inventory  rent  deposits and salary for sales forces  than the company s medical business 
as such  the company may be less profitable over the next few years  as this is a new business model and requires a significant level of start up investment 
industry wide trends that are relevant to the company s business the medical dressings and medical disposables manufacturing market are continually evolving due to technological advances and new demands in the healthcare industry 
the company believes the trends in the industry towards improving medical care and patient conditions  changes in patient treatment approaches and technological advances will impact favorably on the demand for its products 
the company anticipates that these factors will result in a growth in sales of medical dressings and medical disposables and increased revenue for the company 
the export of medical dressings and medical disposables from china has grown rapidly over the last few years 
the company believes that its sales over the next five years will grow in correlation to the growth of medical dressings and medical disposables export volume from china 
the medical dressings and medical disposables market is subject to consumption patterns and trends 
one such trend or consumption pattern relates to the age demographics of the end users of the company s products 
on average  the worldwide population is aging and life spans are generally increasing 
as the general population begins to include a larger percentage of older people  the company anticipates that more medical care will be required  and that will result in increased sales of the company s products 
another trend or consumption pattern in the company s industry is that hospitals are increasingly seeking to reduce their costs 
hospitals reduce costs by seeking alternative products that increase efficiency or reduce labor costs 
for example  disposable catheters may reduce the need for frequent changes of diapers and bed sheets 
other popular disposables used by hospitals to reduce operating costs include eustachian tubes and needles  disposable clothing and accessories 
the company believes the demand for cost effective products and healthcare solutions and an increasing emphasis on health in the united states and european union will bring an increase in the demand for medical instruments  medical dressings and medical disposables 
the company believes that there is a trend in its industry that is resulting in the geographical shift in product manufacturing from countries with high labor and manufacturing costs to countries  where labor and manufacturing costs are generally lower 
as a result of the relatively low cost structure and rapid development of the chinese economy  some foreign multinational companies are entering the chinese market to seek suppliers to produce their goods 
the company believes that having large multinational companies seeking suppliers to produce their products in china will benefit the company 
in addition  the company is negotiating with several large companies in the industry in developed countries which intend to outsource some of their production lines 
the company estimates that china s local market demand for medical dressings and medical disposables will continue to grow 
this presents a significant opportunity for the company 
the company is developing a distribution network to capture opportunities in china  mainly through local distributors  drugstore chains  and direct sales to hospitals 
in order to better develop this market  certain employees have been placed in charge of communicating with local distributors in some major cities  such as guangzhou  fuzhou  chengdu  chongqing  wuhan  fuzhou  shanghai  beijing and shenyang 
the company also directly sells to hospitals in hong kong 
also affecting the company s industry is the growing sensitivity towards protecting the environment and increased health concerns  as consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of the products they buy 
nonwoven medical dressings  medical instruments and medical disposables usually contain materials like rubber and polyester  which may result in restrictions on the purchase of these products under environmental protection regulations 
at the same time  such materials are not biodegradable and composed of petroleum  a non renewable energy resource 
in recent years  cases about melamine tainted milk  recycled edible oil and contaminated vegetables have significantly raised consumers awareness about the environment they live in  the food they eat  and the products they use 
the company believes this trend will be a competitive advantage because its new purcotton products are primarily made of natural cotton and manufactured in an environmentally friendly fashion 
the company believes purcotton products are medium to long term growth contributor to its revenue  because they can be applied to consumer products as well as to the medical industry 
competition the company competes based upon manufacturing capacity  product quality  product cost  ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities 
the company encounters significant competition within china and throughout the world 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial resources  additional human resources  and more established market recognition in both domestic and international markets 
the company believes that its china based competitors have lower labor costs  but their products often lack diversity 
with respect to the company s competitors located outside china  it believes competitors in india generally utilize older equipment to manufacture their products  resulting in lower product quality 
the company s competition in europe and north and south america may have a geographic advantage in the eu and us markets  however  the company believes they are generally manufacturing on a smaller scale  have less product diversity and higher production costs 
as a natural product  it is environmentally friendly  reproducible  comfortable  non allergenic and static free 
with this new technology  the company can produce environmentally friendly cotton nonwoven at a lower cost 
the company s new technology modifies the conventional manufacturing method of nonwoven cloth 
the company refined the production equipment and reduced the number of steps in making nonwoven cloth 
as a result  the new technology allows the company to minimize raw material waste  save production costs  and improve production efficiency 
chinese government actions in favor of the company chinese medical reform 
the chinese government s announced rmb billion healthcares spending in the following three years to reform the healthcare system will greatly improve the accessibility to and desire for medical care 
the chinese government s increased spending in the medical devices sector is a driving force of the company s future development 
increased government subsidies 
the chinese government increased the subsidies to private enterprises to stimulate innovation  research and development  brand promotion and management improvement 
the company has already received and expects to receive some of these government subsidies 
vat tax reform 
the chinese government reformed its policy on value added taxes  vat  for purchased machinery 
starting january   the input vat for machinery is eligible for a reimbursement 
this new policy will reduce the company s cost on equipment technical improvements and purchase of machineries 
tax rebate policy 
the chinese state ministry of finance and state ministry of taxation announced that as of june   the tax rebate rate for exports of medical dressing and related products would be increased by two percent 
effective from june   the tax rebate rate for exports of all the company s medical dressing products  and also some types of medical equipment will increase from to  the tax rebate rate for exports of the company s plastic and glass products will increase from to
