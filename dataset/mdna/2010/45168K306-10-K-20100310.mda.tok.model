item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of dna and rna based drug candidates targeted to toll like receptors  or tlrs  to treat infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer  and asthma and allergies  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
drug candidates are compounds that we are developing and that have not been approved for any commercial use 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells that recognize the dna or rna of bacteria or viruses and initiate an immune response 
relying on our expertise in dna and rna chemistry  we have designed and created proprietary tlr agonists and antagonists to modulate immune responses 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response through the targeted tlr 
our business strategy is to advance applications of our tlr targeted drug candidates in multiple disease areas simultaneously 
we are advancing some of these applications through internal programs  and we seek to advance 
table of contents other applications through collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
collaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs 
upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs 
our internal programs are focused on developing tlr targeted drug candidates for the potential treatment of infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer  and asthma and allergies 
we are conducting two phase clinical trials of imo  a tlr agonist  in patients with chronic hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection 
we are conducting a phase clinical trial of imo  an antagonist of tlr and tlr  in healthy subjects 
in addition to our internal programs  we currently are collaborating with two pharmaceutical companies to advance other applications of our tlr targeted compounds 
we are collaborating with merck kgaa for cancer treatment  excluding cancer vaccines 
merck kgaa is conducting two phase b clinical trials and one phase clinical trial in cancer indications 
we also are collaborating with merck co  inc  or merck co  for vaccine adjuvants in the fields of cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
merck kgaa and merck co 
are not related 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant funds until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our products  we need to address a number of technological challenges and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher than our research and development expenses in as we expand our clinical trials of imo and imo and accelerate our preclinical studies on tlr antagonists and on agonists of tlr and tlr critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and stock based compensation fit the description of critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition our corporate strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of our 
table of contents agreements have included non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and preclinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
our policy for recognizing revenue requires that four basic criteria are met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services have been rendered or obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of the last three criteria are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered or products delivered and the collectability of these fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for any future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront fees received under collaboration agreements  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our contractual obligation or our estimated continuing involvement under the research arrangement 
if the estimated period of continuing involvement is subsequently modified  we will modify the period over which the upfront fee is recognized  accordingly  on a prospective basis 
we recognize revenue from reimbursements earned in connection with our research and development collaboration agreements as related research and development costs are incurred  and our contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
we include amounts contractually owed us under these research and development collaboration agreements  including any earned but unbilled receivables  in trade accounts receivable in our balance sheets 
our principal costs under these agreements are generally for our personnel and related expenses of conducting research and development  as well as for research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants or related research and development materials provided by third parties or for clinical trials we conduct on behalf of a collaborator 
for payments that are specifically associated with a separate earnings process  we recognize revenue when the specific performance obligation is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonable assured 
in the event that the agreement provides for payment to be made subsequent to our standard payment terms  we recognize revenue when payment is due 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets 
we classify amounts that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months as short term deferred revenue 
we classify amounts that we do not expect to recognize within the next twelve months as long term deferred revenue 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
however  this estimate is based on our collaboration agreements and our current operating plan and  if either should change  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next twelve month period 
our estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in our collaborations and the estimated periods over which our performance obligations will be completed 
in some instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may 
table of contents change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in our financial statements based on their fair values 
we record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the non vested portion of stock based awards granted prior to january   when we adopted asc  over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the estimated fair value adjusted for forfeitures 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including assumptions as to average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
for the assumed risk free interest rate  we use the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
for options granted during and  we use an expected option life based on the average of the option term and the option vesting period for standard options and based on actual experience of options held by employees holding options with similar characteristics for those options that do not meet the sec s criteria for using the simplified method 
for options granted after december   we use an expected option life based on actual experience 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
although the black scholes option pricing model is widely used  existing valuation models  including the black scholes  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc prior authoritative literature emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property on a retrospective basis for all collaborative arrangements existing as of january  asc defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in collaborative arrangements and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance concerning the organization of authoritative guidance under generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap 
this new guidance created the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc 
the asc has become the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the asc is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  on its effective date  the asc superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non sec accounting literature not included in the asc has become nonauthoritative 
as the asc is not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
during the second quarter of  we adopted asc prior authoritative literature fasb staff position no 
fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
asc 
table of contents requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
the adoption of asc did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we adopted asc prior authoritative literature fasb staff position no 
fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
asc provides additional guidelines for making fair value measurements  provides authoritative guidance in determining whether a market is active or inactive and whether a transaction is distressed 
asc requires additional disclosures of the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the defining of the major security types comprising debt and equity securities held based upon the nature and risk of the security 
the adoption of asc did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we adopted asc prior authoritative literature fasb staff position no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
asc changes existing accounting requirements for other than temporary impairment of debt securities 
the adoption of asc did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we adopted asc prior authoritative literature fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 subsequent events 
asc is similar to the subsequent events guidance in the current auditing literature except that it clarifies and discloses the period during which companies monitor subsequent events in order to determine what impact  if any  the subsequent events have on the information disclosed in the financial statements and footnotes 
the adoption of asc did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting for revenue recognition under multiple element arrangements  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect of these new requirements on our financial statements 
results of operations years ended december   and alliance revenue our alliance revenues were comprised primarily of revenue earned under various collaboration and licensing agreements including license fees  research and development revenues  including reimbursement of internal and third party expenses  milestones and other patent related reimbursements 
the following table is a summary of our alliance revenue earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements year ended december  annual percentage change in millions license fees research and development milestones other total alliance revenue license fees 
license fees primarily include license fee revenue recognized under our collaborations with merck kgaa  merck co 
and novartis 
license fee revenue during  and was comprised of a portion of upfront license fee payments and  if applicable  any research period extension payments we recognized from collaborative alliances  with which we are still involved during the period 
we recognize license fee revenue 
table of contents ratably over the expected period of our continuing involvement in the collaborations  which generally represents the estimated research period of the agreement 
the following table is a summary of license fees recognized under our three principal collaborations year ended december  collaborator in millions merck kgaa merck co 
novartis we received a million upfront payment from merck kgaa in euros in february of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time 
we are recognizing the million upfront payment as revenue over the twenty eight month research term 
we received a million upfront payment from merck co 
in december we are recognizing the million upfront payment as revenue over the two year initial research term and the additional two year period over which the research term has been extended 
we also received a million upfront payment from novartis in july and an additional million payment in may to extend the research portion of the agreement 
the amount of license fee revenue we recognized under our may research collaboration with novartis decreased in and  since we completed our research obligations in the amount of license fee revenue for merck kgaa increased in reflecting a full year of involvement 
we expect the license fee revenue we recognize from merck kgaa and merck co 
to decrease in as we complete our research obligations under these agreements 
as of december   we have million of deferred revenue under our merck kgaa collaboration and million of deferred revenue under our merck co 
collaboration 
research and development 
research and development revenue increased by million in due to the reimbursement of clinical trial costs associated with the three clinical trials that we conducted under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenue from research reimbursements under our collaboration with merck co 
as we had fewer employee expenses that were reimbursed under our collaboration with merck co 
we expect research and development revenue to be substantially lower in future periods because in september  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of our ongoing phase b clinical trials of imo in addition  in march  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of the phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects 
we will have no further responsibility for conducting clinical trials on behalf of merck kgaa 
however  the research term will continue until june the million increase in research and development revenue in is due to clinical trial costs associated with the clinical trials that we conducted under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa in  which expenses are reimbursed by merck kgaa 
the increase in is also attributable to the purchase of our bulk imo drug supply by merck kgaa at cost in and increased research costs attributable to expanding research under our merck co 
collaboration agreement  which costs are reimbursed by merck co 
milestones 
milestone revenue increased in as we earned milestone revenue of million under our collaboration with merck kgaa relating to the dosing in january of the first patient in the clinical trial of imo in patients with colorectal cancer and to the initiation in december of a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
our milestone revenue was attributable to million earned under our collaboration with novartis relating to the initiation of a phase clinical trial of qax by novartis and million earned under our collaboration with merck co 
relating to a preclinical milestone achieved by merck co 
with one of our novel tlr agonists used as an adjuvant in a cancer vaccine under preclinical study 
in  we also earned a million milestone under another collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to 
table of contents million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased imo clinical trial expenses associated with the three clinical trials that we conducted under our merck kgaa agreement  which expenses are reimbursed by merck kgaa  increased nonclinical safety studies and manufacturing of imo in preparation for imo clinical trials  and increased discovery research expenses 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in nonclinical safety studies and manufacturing of imo the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased nonclinical safety studies and clinical costs associated with our ongoing clinical trial of imo in hcv null responders  which we commenced in september  increased costs for nonclinical safety studies associated with imo  increased research expenses under our merck co 
agreement  which merck co 
reimbursed  and increased imo clinical trial expenses associated with the two clinical trials of imo that we conducted under our merck kgaa agreement  which merck kgaa reimbursed 
these increases were offset  in part  by decreases in expenses in related to our phase clinical trial of imo combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with solid tumor cancers and to our phase stage a clinical trial of imo as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer  as we closed enrollment in both of these trials in year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense total research and development expense in the preceding table  research and development expense is set forth in the following five categories imo external development expenses 
imo is being developed for cancer  excluding vaccines  under our collaboration with merck kgaa 
external development expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo and through december   we have incurred approximately million in external expenses in connection with imo under our collaboration  merck kgaa is responsible for all development of imo for the treatment of cancer excluding vaccines 
merck kgaa agreed to reimburse us for costs associated with any trials that we initiated and conducted  including costs associated with the phase b clinical trials of imo in patients with non small cell lung cancer and in patients with colorectal cancer and a phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects  that were incurred after february   which is the date our agreement with merck kgaa became effective 
in september  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of our ongoing phase b clinical trials of imo merck kgaa is now the sponsor of all clinical trials of imo for the treatment of cancer and has assumed responsibility for all further clinical development of imo in the treatment of cancer  excluding vaccines 
as a result  we expect expenses incurred by us for imo development to be substantially lower in future periods 
imo external development expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in and were consistent between and the increase from to was primarily attributable to increases in costs  which costs are reimbursed by merck kgaa  associated with our phase b clinical trials of imo in patients with non small cell lung cancer  which we initiated in december  and imo in patients with colorectal cancer  for which we commenced dosing in january  and our phase clinical trial in healthy subjects that we initiated in april this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in imo 
table of contents expenses associated with our phase stage a clinical trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer which was completed in the second quarter of in  clinical trial expenses related to our phase clinical trial of imo combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with solid tumor cancers and our phase stage a clinical trial of imo in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer decreased from as we closed enrollment in this decrease was offset by increased clinical trial expenses in associated with the phase b clinical trial of imo in patients with non small cell lung cancer  which we initiated in december  as well as clinical trial expenses incurred in anticipation of the phase b clinical trial of imo in patients with colorectal cancer  for which we commenced dosing in january in december  we initiated a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with avastin and tarceva  agents approved for the treatment of specific cancers  in patients with non small cell lung cancer whose cancer had progressed during a prior course of standard therapy 
we designed the trial to assess the safety of imo in combination with standard dosages and schedules of tarceva and avastin and to determine the recommended dosage of imo for potential use in a subsequent phase trial 
in the trial  imo was administered at four escalating dose levels of    and mg kg week with fixed standard dose regimens of avastin and tarceva 
patients received imo subcutaneously once a week  with each patient continuing to receive therapy until disease progression as determined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  or recist  or another protocol specified stopping criterion was met 
in september  we reported preliminary data from the dose escalation portion of the trial 
the combination of imo with avastin and tarceva was well tolerated at all dose levels  and eight of the patients enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the trial remained on treatment for at least weeks 
of the patients evaluable for tumor response in the dose escalation portion of the trial  three had a partial response and eight experienced stable disease 
based on the dose escalation portion of the trial  merck kgaa selected a dose level of imo for expanded patient recruitment to evaluate further the safety and pharmacokinetics of the combination 
in january  we initiated a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with erbitux  a biological agent approved for treatment of certain cancers  and chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer whose cancer had progressed during a prior course of standard therapy 
we designed the trial to assess the safety of the imo  erbitux  and chemotherapy combination and to determine the recommended dosage of imo for potential use in a subsequent phase clinical trial 
this trial was designed with a target enrollment of up to patients 
under the protocol for the trial  imo is being administered at three escalating dose levels with fixed standard dose regimens of erbitux and chemotherapy 
patients are receiving imo subcutaneously once a week  with each patient continuing to receive therapy until disease progression  as determined by recist  or another protocol specified stopping criterion is met 
in april  we initiated on behalf of merck kgaa a phase clinical trial of imo monotherapy in healthy subjects 
the phase healthy subjects trial was designed to characterize further the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of imo after single and multiple weekly subcutaneous and intravenous administrations 
all scheduled patient visits were completed by june prior to entering our collaboration with merck kgaa  we conducted three phase clinical trials and one phase clinical trial of imo the phase clinical trials included a rising dose trial in healthy subjects  a rising dose trial in advanced cancer patients  and a combination trial of imo with gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy in advanced cancer patients 
the phase clinical trial was a phase stage a clinical trial of imo monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer 
the study contained four arms  comprised of a total of treatment na ve and second line patients randomly assigned to receive imo subcutaneously at either mg kg week or mg kg week 
the primary objective of the study was tumor response based on recist 
secondary objectives included time to progression  survival and safety 
progression free survival was also analyzed 
the primary objective was not achieved in the study 
however  the median progression free survival was months and months for the and mg kg week treatment na ve patients  and months and months for the and mg kg week second line patients 
the median overall survival was months over all arms and of patients had stable disease 
two patients one second line and one treatment na ve  and each receiving mg kg week had confirmed partial responses  and seven 
table of contents patients received weekly imo treatment for at least one year 
imo treatment was generally well tolerated with good dose intensity in all arms of the study 
approximately million and million of expenses in and  respectively  related to the phase b clinical trial in patients with non small cell lung cancer  the phase b clinical trial in patients with colorectal cancer and the phase clinical trial in healthy subjects  which expenses are reimbursed by merck kgaa 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead compound that we are developing for chronic hcv infection 
these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and since then we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with our phase clinical trials and related nonclinical studies and manufacturing and related process development 
external development expenses for imo decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs in associated with producing imo in anticipation of our phase i clinical trials and a decrease in costs for nonclinical safety studies of imo  which decreased because a lower level of nonclinical safety and manufacturing activity was required to support the clinical trials ongoing during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs related to our phase clinical trial to assess the safety of imo in combination with ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv patients  which we initiated in october external development expenses for imo increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to manufacturing imo  our phase clinical trial of imo in null responder hcv patients  which we commenced in september  and costs for nonclinical safety studies of imo initiated after the may submission to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  of the imo investigational new drug  or ind  application 
in may  we submitted an ind application for imo to the fda 
in september  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with genotype chronic hcv infection who had no response to a prior regimen of the current standard of care therapy 
we refer to these patients as null responder hcv patients 
the clinical trial is currently being conducted at six sites in the united states 
in the trial  we are enrolling cohorts of ten patients at escalating imo dose levels 
to date  we have enrolled patients in four cohorts  evaluating imo at mg kg week  mg kg week  mg kg week and mg kg week 
based on interim results from these cohorts  we extended the trial to a fifth dose level and are currently enrolling patients in a fifth cohort at mg kg week 
of the ten patients in a cohort  eight are randomized to receive imo treatment and two are randomized to receive placebo treatment 
patients receive a single dose of imo or placebo once per week by subcutaneous injection for four weeks 
the primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety of imo at each dose level 
we are also evaluating the effects of imo on hcv rna levels and on immune system activation in this trial 
in december  we announced interim results from null responder hcv patients treated through the originally planned four cohorts of this trial 
imo was well tolerated by all patients in the four cohorts 
imo treated patients showed dose dependent increases in natural interferon alpha and other antiviral proteins including interferon inducible protein and  oligoadenylate synthetase 
in addition  an increasing percentage of patients  ranging from at the mg kg week dose level to at the mg kg week dose level  achieved a maximum reduction in viral load of log or more at least once during the four week treatment period 
in contrast  none of the patients who received placebo treatment or imo at the mg kg week dose level achieved a maximum reduction in viral load of log or greater at any time during the four week treatment period 
we plan to present detailed interim results of the trial at a scientific meeting in the second quarter of in addition to the on going phase clinical trial of imo in null responder hcv patients  we are conducting a phase clinical trial of imo in combination with ribavirin  an antiviral medication approved for use in combination with interferon alpha in the treatment of hcv infection  in treatment na ve patients with 
table of contents genotype chronic hcv infection 
we initiated the trial in october in this clinical trial  patients will receive imo or a control article by subcutaneous injection once per week for four weeks at escalating dose levels in combination with daily oral administration of standard doses of ribavirin 
a total of patients are planned for the first cohort  with randomized to receive imo and ribavirin and three randomized to receive placebo and ribavirin as the control 
starting with the second cohort  patients will be randomized to receive imo and ribavirin and six patients will be randomized to receive pegylated recombinant alfa a interferon and ribavirin as the control 
the primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of imo in combination with ribavirin 
in addition  we plan to monitor the effect of treatment on hcv rna levels 
the clinical trial is currently being conducted at sites in france and russia 
following the completion of our phase study in null responder hcv patients  we plan to initiate in the second half of a clinical trial in null responders in which patients will receive imo in combination with ribavirin for weeks 
with the data from this trial  together with the data from the two phase clinical trials  we plan to determine the next steps in the clinical development of imo for hcv infection 
as a result  we expect imo external development expenses to increase in imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead tlr tlr antagonist drug candidate  since november  when we commenced clinical development of imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since november  we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with the start up of our phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects and manufacturing and related process development 
in the fourth quarter of  we submitted to the fda an ind application for the clinical evaluation of imo in autoimmune diseases 
in january  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects 
in this rising single dose phase trial  imo is being administered by subcutaneous injection 
the primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability of imo secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of imo and to assess the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action through measurement of the response of pbmcs to tlr and tlr agonists 
the trial is being conducted at a single us site 
we plan to use the results from this rising single dose clinical trial to select dosages for an anticipated follow up trial in healthy subjects 
the purpose of the second phase trial would be to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic mechanism of action of imo with escalating doses in a study involving the subcutaneous administration of imo once per week for four weeks 
we intend to identify an initial autoimmune disease indication for further clinical development of imo by the end of other drug development expenses 
these expenses include internal and external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development in addition to internal costs associated with products in clinical development 
the internal and external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
the internal expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our hepatitis c clinical advisory board  our oncology clinical advisory board  our autoimmune disease scientific advisory board  payroll and overhead 
the increase in from was primarily due to increases in manufacturing and other pre ind direct external expenses  including nonclinical safety studies  related to imo that we incurred through november when we submitted the ind for imo to the fda 
other drug development expenses were consistent between and in  we had a decrease from in other drug development expenses attributable to lower payroll expenses resulting from fewer full time equivalent positions associated with and allocated to preclinical and clinical development and a decrease in imo expenses due to attribution of imo expenses incurred after the commencement of clinical development in may to the imo external development expense category shown separately above 
this decrease between and in other drug 
table of contents development expenses in was partially offset by increased costs associated with nonclinical safety studies associated with imo and other compounds during basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to discovery research in our tlr targeted programs  including tlr   and agonists  tlr antagonists  and tlr antisense compounds 
these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
basic discovery expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in and increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in laboratory supply costs and allocated facility costs and higher stock based compensation for employees 
the increase in expense in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll expenses  including higher stock based compensation for employees  laboratory supply costs and allocated costs relating to work under our merck co 
collaboration 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  without knowing the results of our ongoing clinical trials and without an established plan for future clinical tests of drug candidates  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of any drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated  in part  with our patent applications and maintenance  our regulatory filing requirements  and business development 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to lower consulting fees and lower external patent expenses and stock based compensation for consultants in this decrease was offset by increased employee costs in this area  including higher stock based compensation expense for employees 
the million increase from to primarily reflects higher employee stock compensation expense  higher consulting fees associated with corporate business strategic initiatives undertaken in and higher patent filing and preparation costs 
the increase in stock compensation expense was  in the year ended december  and was primarily the result of stock compensation expenses associated with employee stock options granted in when our stock price was higher than in previous years 
these increases were offset  in part  by lower corporate legal expenses  lower payroll expenses as a result of our former president s resignation at the end of and no costs related to the transition agreement entered into with our former chief financial officer in may investment income  net investment income decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in these decreases are primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our money market funds  lower yields on our investments  and lower average funds earning interest during interest expense interest expense was negligible in and was consistent from to interest expense in reflected interest through our march repayment in full of our note payable to general electric capital corporation  or ge  and a prepayment premium associated with the note repayment

income tax expense in  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  which was primarily related to the carry back of net operating losses to recover alternative minimum tax as a result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  which was primarily related to refundable research and experimental tax credits 
we did not have income subject to the alternative minimum tax for the years ended december  and foreign currency exchange loss foreign currency exchange loss was negligible in and million in in february  merck kgaa paid us a million upfront license fee denominated in euros 
we received million us dollars due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time we received the payment  which resulted in the foreign currency exchange loss 
there was no foreign currency exchange loss for the year ended net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  we had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  we have incurred losses of million since january  we incurred net losses of million prior to december  during which time we were involved in the development of antisense technology 
since our inception  we had an accumulated deficit of million through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million and million available to reduce federal and state taxable income which expire through and  respectively 
in addition  we had cumulative federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce federal and state income taxes  which expire through and  respectively 
the tax reform act of contains provisions  which limit the amount of nols and credit carryforwards that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
we have completed several financings since the effective date of the tax reform act of  which as of december   have resulted in ownership changes in excess of and that will significantly limit our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards 
as a result of this ownership change  we estimate that between and of the million in federal nols could be utilized to offset federal taxable income and approximately of the million of federal tax credit carryforwards could be used to offset federal income taxes 
ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures and to pay debt service 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following equity and debt financing  license fees and research funding under collaborative and license agreements  interest income  and lease financings

funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except  and  and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaboration and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available  or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million at december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december  based on our current operating plan  which assumes that we will continue to conduct our three ongoing clinical trials and that we will conduct the week phase b clinical trial of imo in null responder hcv patients and the week phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects that we plan to initiate in but does not assume that we will conduct any other clinical trials 
we will need to raise additional funds to operate our business beyond such date 
however  if we elect to conduct additional clinical trials beyond our ongoing clinical trials and the planned imo and imo trials  we may need to raise funds prior to such date 
we may seek additional funding through collaborations  the sale or license of assets or financings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain additional funding are the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the success of our existing strategic collaborations with merck kgaa and merck co  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  
table of contents the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations

additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders
