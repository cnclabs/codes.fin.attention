overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 
based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of over  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target 
in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as is typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate

impairment expense based on the results of our annual impairment tests performed as of march  an indication of impairment existed at the staffmark reporting unit 
in each of our other businesses reporting units the result of the annual goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the business exceeded its carrying value 
based on the results of the second step of the impairment test at staffmark  we estimated that the carrying value of staffmark goodwill exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
as a result of this shortfall  we recorded a million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of april  and indicated that the fair values of the reporting units businesses exceeded their carrying values and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
accordingly  there were no charges for goodwill impairment in or in connection with the annual goodwill impairment we tested other indefinite lived intangible assets at our staffmark reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name  based principally on the discontinuance of the use of the cbs personnel trade name and rebranding of the reporting units business to staffmark beginning in february during  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million at the corporate level to decrease the carrying value of the cbs personnel trade name to its fair value

adjustments to depreciation and amortization resulting from purchase allocations that were not pushed down to a business are not included as a component of operating results 
we believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results 
the following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year  going forward 
advanced circuits overview advanced circuits is a provider of prototype  quick turn and volume production pcbs to customers throughout the united states 
collectively  prototype and quick turn pcbs represent approximately of advanced circuits gross revenues 
prototype and quick turn pcbs typically command higher margins than volume production pcb s given that customers require high levels of responsiveness  technical support and timely delivery of prototype and quick turn pcbs and are willing to pay a premium for them 
advanced circuits is able to meet its customers demands by manufacturing custom pcbs in as little as hours  while maintaining over error free production rates and real time customer service and product tracking hours per day 
while global demand for pcbs has remained strong in recent years  industry wide domestic production has declined over since in contrast  advanced circuits revenues increased steadily through as its customers prototype and quick turn pcb requirements  such as small quantity orders and rapid turnaround  are less able to be met by low cost volume manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
advanced circuits management anticipates that demand for its prototype and quick turn printed circuit boards will remain strong and anticipates that demand will be impacted less by current economic conditions than by its longer lead time production business  which is driven more by consumer purchasing patterns and capital investments by businesses

the interest rate swap is intended to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and effectively converts million of our floating rate term loan facility to a fixed rate basis for a period of three years 
on february   we terminated million of our outstanding interest rate swap in connection with the repayment of million of our term loan facility 
termination fees totaled million  which represented the fair value of the terminated portion of the swap as of february  our term loan facility received a b rating from moody s investors service moody s  and a bb rating from standard and poor s rating services and our revolving credit facility received a ba rating from moody s  reflective of our strong cash flow relative to debt  and industry diversification of our businesses

we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of march  at each of our reporting units  the units fair value exceeded carrying value with the exception of staffmark 
the carrying amount of staffmark exceeded its fair value due primarily to the significant decrease in revenue and operating profit at staffmark resulting from the negative impact on temporary staffing and permanent placement revenues due to macroeconomic conditions and downward employment trends experienced in and as a result  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved comparing the implied fair value of staffmark s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
this comparison resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
at march   our last annual impairment test date  the fair value of two of our reporting units  not including staffmark  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by less than ten percent 
the goodwill allocated to each of these reporting units at december  is as follows reporting unit goodwill allocated american furniture million halo million we perform our annual impairment test on march of each fiscal year 
estimating the fair value of reporting units involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results 
if current conditions change from those expected  it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 
due to the minimal amount that these reporting units fair value exceeded their carrying value at march  it is possible that on march   our next annual impairment test date  if conditions change adversely from what we currently expect we could experience a goodwill impairment charge 
the table below details cash receipts and payments that are not reflected on our income statement in order to provide an additional measure of management s estimate of cash flow available for distribution cad 
cad is a non gaap measure that we believe provides additional information to our shareholders in order to enable them to evaluate our ability to make anticipated quarterly distributions 
because other entities do not necessarily calculate cad the same way we do  our presentation of cad may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other entities 
we believe that our historic and future cad  together with our cash balances and access to cash via our debt facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated distributions over the next twelve months 
the table below reconciles cad to net income and to cash flow provided by operating activities  which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

cash flows from american furniture are typically highest in the months of january through april of each year  coinciding with homeowners tax refunds

in addition  as a result of the exchange the company received cash from a noncontrolling shareholder and recorded an increase to noncontrolling interest of million 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have no special purpose entities or off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business 
long term contractual obligations  except for our long term debt obligations  are generally not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
non cancelable purchase obligations are obligations we incur during the normal course of business  based on projected needs 
the table below summarizes the payment schedule of our contractual obligations at december  in thousands 
more than total less than year years years years long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c supplemental put obligation d a reflects commitment fees and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and amounts due  together with interest on our term loan facility 
b reflects various operating leases for office space  manufacturing facilities and equipment from third parties 
c reflects non cancelable commitments as of december   including i shareholder distributions of million  ii management fees of million per year over the next five years and  iii other obligations  including amounts due under employment agreements 
distributions to our shareholders are approved by our board of directors each fiscal quarter 
the amount approved for future quarters may differ from the amount included in this schedule 
d the supplemental put obligation represents the long term portion of an estimated liability accrued as if our management services agreement with cgm had been terminated 
this agreement has not been terminated and there is no basis upon which to determine a date in the future  if any  that this amount will be paid 
the table does not include the long term portion of the actuarially developed reserve for workers compensation  which does not provide for annual estimated payments beyond one year 
this liability  totaling approximately million at december   is included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of workers compensation liability 
critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for the company  the trust and each of our businesses 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our management services agreement  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
we adjust the supplemental put agreement to its fair value quarterly by recording any change in value through the income statement 
the fair value of the supplemental put agreement is largely related to the value of the profit allocation that our manager  as holder of allocation interests  will receive 
the valuation of the supplemental put agreement requires the use of complex models  which require highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
annually  we confer with outside experts as to the reasonableness of our assumptions and estimates 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
staffmark recognizes revenue for temporary staffing services at the time services are provided by staffmark employees and reports revenue based on gross billings to customers 
revenue from staffmark employee leasing services is recorded at the time services are provided 
such revenue is reported on a net basis gross billings to clients less worksite employee salaries  wages and payroll related taxes 
we believe that net revenue accounting for leasing services more closely depicts the transactions with its leasing customers and is consistent with guidelines outlined in authoritative guidance 
the effect of using this method of accounting is to report lower revenue than would be otherwise reported 
business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining certain assumptions used in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecast and a market approach which compares peer data and multiples 
we then compare those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material adverse effects in relationships with significant customers 
the implied fair value of reporting units is determined by management and generally is based upon future cash flow projections for the reporting unit  discounted to present value and market comparison to comparable peer companies 
we use outside valuation experts to assist us in determining and evaluating the fair value of our reporting units 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of march  at each of our reporting units  the units fair value exceeded carrying value with the exception of staffmark 
the carrying amount of staffmark exceeded its fair value due primarily to the significant decrease in revenue and operating profit at staffmark resulting from the negative impact on temporary staffing and permanent placement revenues due to macroeconomic conditions and downward employment trends experienced in and as a result  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved comparing the implied fair value of staffmark s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
this comparison resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with the annual goodwill impairment testing  we tested other indefinite lived intangible assets at our staffmark reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name an indefinite lived asset  based principally on the discontinuance of the cbs personnel trade name and rebranding of the reporting unit to staffmark in february the fair value of the cbs personnel trade name was determined by applying the relief from royalty technique to forecasted revenues at the staffmark reporting unit 
the result of this analysis indicated that the carrying value of the trade name million exceeded its fair value million by million 
therefore  an impairment charge of million is recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining balance million of the cbs personnel trade name is being amortized over years 
see footnote i to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived intangible assets subject to amortization  including customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever indications of impairment are present 
the determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or the incurrence of an impairment charge allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
workers compensation liability staffmark is an employer with both self insurance and large deductible plans for its worker s compensation exposure 
staffmark establishes reserves based upon its experience and expectations as to its ultimate liability for those claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
staffmark continually evaluates the potential for change in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of december   staffmark had approximately million in workers compensation liability related to claims  reserves and settlements 
the ultimate settlement of this liability could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate this liability  which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
deferred tax assets several of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
these deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable 
see note m income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements refer to footnote b to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit agreement because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility portions of our credit agreement at december  we fixed million of the term loan facility borrowings with a floating to fixed interest rate swap with a bank 
this swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the last million of our term debt at through our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on the remaining million in term debt and million in revolving debt is not deemed to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists principally of i treasury and government backed securities money market funds  ii insured prime money market funds  iii fdic insured certificates of deposit  iv commercial paper and  cash balances in several non interest bearing checking accounts 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
