item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we believe that we are one of a limited number of manufacturers that provide a seamless  integrated flexible printed circuit and assembly solution from design and application engineering and prototyping through high volume fabrication  component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  we focus on applications where flexible printed circuits facilitate human interaction with an electronic device and are the enabling technology in achieving a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current applications for our products include feature phones  smart phones  consumer electronic devices  portable bar code scanners  computer storage devices and medical devices 
we provide our solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems  who produce devices such as feature phones and smart phones and to electronic manufacturing services ems providers  whom typically perform the final assembly of such devices 
our business model  and the way we approach the markets which we serve  is based on value added engineering and providing technology solutions to our customers facilitating the miniaturization of portable electronics and the speed to market 
through early supplier involvement with customers  we look to assist in the development of new designs and processes for the manufacturing of their products and  through value added component assembly of components on flex  seek to provide a higher level of product within their supply chain structure 
this approach is relatively unique and serves to help differentiate us from other traditional contract manufacturers  however  it may or may not always fit with the operating practices of all oems 
our ability to add to our customer base may have a direct impact on the relative percentage of each customer s revenue to total revenues during any reporting period 
we typically have numerous programs in production at any particular time 
the programs prices are subject to intense negotiation and are determined on a program by program basis  dependent on a wide variety of factors  including without limitation  expected volumes  assumed yields  material costs  actual yields  and the amount of third party components within the program 
our profitability is dependent upon how we perform against our targets and the assumptions on which we base our prices for each particular program 
our volumes  margins and yields also vary from program to program and  given various factors and assumptions on which we base our prices  are not necessarily indicative of our profitability 
in fact  some lower priced programs have higher margins while other higher priced programs have lower margins 
given that the programs in production vary from period to period and the pricing and margins between programs vary widely  volumes are not necessarily indicative of our performance 
for example  we could experience an increase in volumes for a particular program during a particular period  but depending on that program s margins and yields and the other programs in production during that period  those higher volumes may or may not result in an increase in overall profitability 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
our chinese subsidiary provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and 
table of contents multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed a second wholly owned subsidiary in china to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in fiscal  we leased a manufacturing facility in pontian  malaysia for flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in addition  in fiscal  we leased office space in singapore for our asia pacific regional office 
we are also currently in the process of completing construction on our third manufacturing facility in china  mfc  and have begun construction at mflex chengdu for a flexible printed circuit assembly facility 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
as of september   we engaged the services of certain non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
these sales representatives were located throughout the united states  korea  and china 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are made to customers outside of the united states  and therefore sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our anaheim  california facility  singapore regional office and our united kingdom facility are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or rmb for sales made in china 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs include all materials and facilities associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  stock based compensation expense related to such personnel  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost represents the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product 
purchased process services relate to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements 
research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense includes commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related costs associated with sales and marketing  business development and engineering support groups and expenses for overseas sales support  trade show and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits of administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel and other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment and other corporate office expenses 
impairment and restructuring asset impairment is the difference between the fair market value  based on the estimated future cash flows of the underlying assets  and the carrying value  or net book value  of the assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the underlying assets 
restructuring expense represents severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure or disposal of a business unit or location 

table of contents interest income interest income consists of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents balances and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on our long term debt  unused line fees on our revolving facilities and interest related to our deferred financing costs 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists primarily of the gain or loss on our previously held auction rate securities investments and the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the fasb authoritative guidance which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards and assemblies  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
an ems provider may or may not be an oem subcontractor 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectability of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report revenues net of an allowance for returns  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory 
table of contents and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may change  which we will record in the period such determination is made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we have considered taxable income in prior carry back years  expected future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
our warranty periods range up to thirty six months  depending on the related product 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
long lived asset impairment 
we test for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considered internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  there is no impairment 

table of contents restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities 
in connection with these activities  we record restructuring charges for employee termination and relocation costs and other exit related costs 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent that actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
in conjunction with the planned closure of our facility in malaysia  one of our facilities in anaheim and aurora optical  we estimated the restructuring costs that would result from the closures 
those costs include  but are not limited to  a termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
based on our analysis and review of the relevant fasb authoritative guidance  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure of our facility in malaysia  one of our facilities in anaheim and aurora optical  as well as severance costs as a result of a reduction in force at our facility in the united kingdom 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
generally  our calculation of the fair value for options granted under the revised guidance is similar to the calculation of fair value under the original guidance with 
table of contents the exception of the treatment of forfeitures 
expected forfeitures of stock options are estimated based on the historical turnover of our employees 
the fair value of restricted stock units granted is based on the grant date price of our common stock 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including a the expected volatility of our common stock price  which we determine based on historical volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering ipo  b expected dividends  which are zero  as we do not currently anticipate issuing dividends  c expected life of the stock option  which is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise behavior of our employees  and d risk free interest rate is based on observed interest rates zero coupon us treasury debt securities appropriate for the expected holding period 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of income data  expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment and restructuring operating income interest income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal of our four major customers in fiscal  we noted increases in net sales to one major customer  with an offsetting decrease in sales to another major customer 
however  we also added a new customer which contributed to an increase in sales in fiscal unit volume shipments increased in fiscal in general  there was increased pricing pressure from customers  as well as a lower dollar value of flex assemblies in one high volume program 
net sales into the consumer electronics sector were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal shipments into the consumer electronics sector accounted for approximately and of total net sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents net sales into the wireless sector  which includes wireless handsets  increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase of million  or  versus fiscal was primarily due to the aforementioned addition of a new major customer 
in fiscal and  the wireless sector was comprised of both smart phones and feature phones  which accounted for approximately and  and and of total sales into the wireless sector  respectively 
sales into the wireless sector comprised approximately and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of was primarily attributable to the increase of material content from new programs in the current fiscal year of approximately basis points  which was largely eliminated by improved labor and overhead efficiencies 
gross profit increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  versus million in the prior year  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
we expect quarterly gross margins to be in the to range in the first quarter of fiscal based on projected product mix  sales volume and leveraging of manufacturing costs and the impact of higher costs due to china currency appreciation  higher labor costs in china  and the additional overhead from mfc while the facility is in a ramp up mode 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in the comparable period of the prior year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in emphasis on expanding our research and development activities at our facilities in anaheim  ca and in the united kingdom 
we are investing in research and development related to products and technology in new markets we plan to enter in the future  as well as an increasing efforts to extend our printed keypad technology development in the united kingdom to be integrated into our core flexible printed circuit business 
we believe this potential development could significantly improve the process used to manufacture flexible printed circuits in the future 
toward the end of fiscal  we realigned our global research and development activities in anaheim  ca and the united kingdom by transitioning to lower cost china 
as a result  we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a compensation and benefits expense increase of million as a result of headcount growth to expand our customer base and geographic coverage and an increase of million related to higher sales support costs 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense increased to versus in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our audit and professional fees  and to a lesser extent  travel and communications expenses in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal  attributable to the favorable leveraging impact on our operating expenses from the increased net sales 
we expect general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  to remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year 
impairment and restructuring 
during fiscal  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  primarily to consolidate our global operations and to improve our cost structure 
the million consisted of million attributable to asset impairments and one time termination benefits charges relating to our plan to close our facility in malaysia in order to move the related functions to china as part of our continuing cost reduction efforts  million attributable to asset impairments  one time termination benefits and other restructuring charges relating to our plan to close one of our facilities in anaheim as part of a strategic effort to move more functions  specifically low volume production and process research and development associated with our flex and flex assembly processes  to asia  and million consisting of one time termination benefits and other restructuring related charges as a result of our decision to align our united kingdom research and development efforts with those in anaheim and china  as well as to reduce costs 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we conducted a review of our united kingdom operations mfe due to declines in sales forecasts  technical issues encountered in commercializing the technology and the overall success of the technology being slower to achieve than originally expected 
as a result  we determined to allocate financial resources to other products technologies and limit future investment in mfe 
accordingly  an impairment test was performed to determine whether the undiscounted future cash flows that would be provided by the intangible assets were greater than the carrying value 
as a result of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash charge of million to fully impair our intangible assets as of september  impairment and restructuring costs increased million when compared to fiscal  however  we anticipate that our restructuring plan covering the above elements will result in an estimated million in annual cost savings beginning in fiscal on a pre tax basis 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net increased to a net expense of million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income as a result of the decrease in our cash balance as well as lower average interest rates throughout the fiscal year 
interest expense remained flat in fiscal when compared to fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net increased to income of million in fiscal  from expense of million in fiscal the increased income and reduced expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in net losses from foreign exchange due to the movement of the us dollar versus the rmb and other foreign currencies 
in addition  other expense in fiscal included million of impairment associated with the decline in value of our auction rate securities which were sold at par value during fiscal income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the establishment of valuation allowances on net operating losses related to our malaysia and united kingdom operations as a result of plans to restructure the entities 
in addition  the lower effective tax rate in the prior fiscal year was mainly due to a discrete tax benefits of million which resulted from the expiration of a statute of limitation related to an international tax position and million due to re measurement of a liability associated with an international tax position 
we also recognized a discrete tax expense during fiscal of million due to a change in tax regulations enacted and effective during future tax rates are uncertain and could vary if current tax regulations  particularly those in the us  are changed 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal driven primarily by an increase in average unit sales prices resulting from added material content  partially offset by reduced unit volume shipments 
sales into the consumer electronics sector were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase in sales into the consumer electronics sector was driven primarily by increases in unit volume shipments to one of our key customers related to several programs that were started in the current and prior fiscal year 
shipments into the consumer electronics sector accounted for approximately and of total net sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
net sales into the wireless sector decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  versus fiscal was primarily due to reduced unit volume shipments to two of our major customers as a result of reduced demand  partially offset by an increase in sales to another major customer 
in fiscal and  the wireless sector was comprised of both smart phones and feature phones  which accounted for approximately and  and and of total sales into the wireless sector  respectively 
sales into the wireless sector comprised approximately and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of was primarily attributable to the increase of average material content from new programs in the current fiscal year  partially offset by cost reductions from improved manufacturing yields resulting from operational improvement initiatives 
as a result  gross profit decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  versus million in the prior year  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in the comparable period of the prior year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of million resulting from headcount and salary increases related to our increased emphasis on expanding our research and development activities in anaheim and at pelikon  increased depreciation of million  increased purchased materials of million related to research and development activities  million for increased information technology and human resource support expenses due to expanded activities  and million of other research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a compensation and benefits expense increase of million as a result of headcount growth to expand our customer base and geographic coverage  million for information technology and human resource support expenses to support expanded infrastructure  million related to travel expenses  and a net increase of million from other sales and marketing expenses 
these increases were partially offset by reduced commissions expenses of million due to a change in customer mix and a new negotiated sales commission structure 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense increased to versus in the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million for information technology and human resource expenses  as activities were shifted to support expanded manufacturing operations and infrastructure growth coupled with a net decrease of other general and administrative expenses of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in hardware purchases and software amortization expense of million mainly to support our expanding infrastructure in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal  attributable to the favorable leveraging impact on our operating expenses from the increased net sales 
impairment and restructuring 
during fiscal  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million which consisted of million related to the restructuring of our wholly owned subsidiary  aurora optical  in tucson  arizona  offset by a gain of million related to the sale of equipment 
impairment and restructuring costs decreased million  or  when compared to fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net decreased to income of million in fiscal from income of million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a significant decline in interest rates 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily related to interest accrued against the notes payable issued as part of our acquisition of mfe and unused line fees on our bank loan facilities 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased to an expense of million in fiscal  from an expense of million in fiscal the reduced expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in net losses from foreign exchange due to the movement of the us dollar versus the rmb and other foreign currencies 
in addition  other expense includes million of impairment associated with the decline in value of our auction rate securities during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the tax rate declined primarily as a result of the international reorganization efforts and the transition of technology to further strengthen our asian operations 
in addition  we recognized discrete tax benefits of million due to the expiration of a statute of limitation related to an international tax position and million due to re measurement of a liability associated with an international tax position 
we also recognized a discrete tax expense during fiscal of million due to a change in tax regulations enacted and effective during the higher effective tax rate in the prior fiscal year was mainly due to an additional tax expense of million as a result of the international reorganization 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and our ability to borrow under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions  stock repurchases and other capital expenditures 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
global financial and credit markets recently have been  and continue to be  extremely unstable and unpredictable  which could affect our ability to generate cash 
worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may be further deteriorating 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness in the financial and credit markets could affect the prices at which we could make any such sales  which could also adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
these conditions could also negatively affect our ability to secure funds or raise capital at a reasonable cost  if needed 
it is our policy to carefully monitor the state of our business  cash requirements and capital structure 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in liquidity  market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with bank of america  na  agricultural bank of china or china construction bank 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition based on our current borrowing level 
foreign currency risk we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the us approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers during fiscal were made in us dollars with the remaining balance of our net sales denominated in rmb 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for fiscal to date  we attempt to manage our working capital in a manner to minimize foreign currency exposure 
however  we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
we currently have a significant portion of our expenses  more specifically cost of sales  denominated in rmb  whereby a significant appreciation or depreciation in the rmb could materially affect our reported expenses in usd 
liquidity risk we believe our anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditure requirements  through at least the next fiscal year 
if there was a need for additional cash to fund our operations  we would access our global credit lines
