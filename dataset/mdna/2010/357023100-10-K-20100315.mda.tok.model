item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum bodied railcars and coal carrying railcars in north america  based on the number of railcars delivered 
we also refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged  cast and fabricated parts for the railcars we produce  as well as those manufactured by others 
our primary customers are financial institutions  shippers and railroads 
our manufacturing facilities are located in danville  illinois and roanoke  virginia 
each of our manufacturing facilities has the capability to manufacture a variety of types of railcars 
railcar deliveries totaled  units for the year ended december   including delivery of  cars sold and delivery of  cars leased  compared to  units in the same period of our total backlog of firm orders for railcars decreased by approximately  from  railcars as of december  to railcars as of december  our backlog at december   included units under firm operating leases with independent third parties 
subsequent to december  the company received additional orders for more than  new railcars to be manufactured and delivered over the course of and prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material components of our railcars  and surcharges on steel and railcar components were at historically high levels for the first half of and since then prices have dropped significantly 
substantially all of the contracts covering our current backlog are fixed rate contracts 
therefore  if material costs were to increase  we may not be able to pass on these increased costs to our customers 
the north american railcar market is highly cyclical and the trends in the railcar industry are closely related to the overall level of economic activity 
we expect railroads and utilities to continue to upgrade their fleets of aging steel bodied coal carrying railcars to lighter and more durable aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars 
despite the decline in our backlog  we believe that the long term outlook for railcar demand is positive  due to increased rail traffic and the replacement of aging railcar fleets 
we also believe that the long term outlook for our business  including the demand for our coal carrying railcars  is positive  based on the historic cyclicality of the industry  our expanding product portfolio  our operational efficiency in manufacturing railcars and our international opportunities 
however  us economic conditions may not result in a sustained economic recovery  and our business is subject to these and significant other risks that may cause our current positive outlook to change 
see item a 
risk factors 
in may  we closed our manufacturing facility located in johnstown  pennsylvania 
this action was taken to further our strategy of optimizing production at our low cost facilities and continuing our focus on cost control 
we had entered into decisional bargaining with the uswa  but did not reach an agreement with the uswa that would have allowed us to continue to operate the facility in a cost effective way 
in december  we recorded plant closure charges of million related to these actions 
on june   we announced a tentative global settlement that upon ratification by the johnstown uswa membership and approval by the court resolved all legal disputes relating to the johnstown facility and its workforce  including the sowers hayden class action litigation  contested arbitration ruling and other pending grievance proceedings 
the time for an appeal of the court s order has now run out and the settlement has expired 
during we recorded million in plant closure charges related to these actions 
the total plant closure charges recognized in and were primarily related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
during the fiscal year ended december   management  after a thorough evaluation of the company s current information technology systems and its future needs  determined to upgrade the company s existing information technology system to a fully integrated erp system to be provided by oracle corporation 
the company s new enterprise wide financial system went live on august  in addition to the implementation of the erp system and in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting as more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k 
financial statement presentation revenues our revenues are generated primarily from sales of the railcars that we manufacture 
our sales depend on industry demand for new railcars  which is driven by overall economic conditions and the demand for railcar transportation of various products  primarily coal but also other products such as motor vehicles  steel products  forest products  minerals  cement and agricultural commodities 
our sales are also affected by competitive market pressures that impact the prices for our railcars and by the types of railcars sold 
revenues for also include lease payments received from railcars under operating leases to the same customer base to which we sell railcars 
we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from our customers 
we recognize sales  which we sometimes refer to as deliveries  of new and rebuilt railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk of any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
deliveries include new  used and repair refurbished cars sold and cars contracted under operating leases in that period 
with respect to sales transactions involving the trading in of used railcars  in accordance with accounting rules  we recognize sales for the entire transaction when the cash consideration received is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration received is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value 
the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders may cause our sales and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter  which will result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials such as aluminum and steel  as well as the cost of finished railcar components  such as castings  wheels  truck components and couplers  and other specialty components 
our cost of sales also includes labor  utilities  freight  manufacturing depreciation and other manufacturing overhead costs 
factors that have affected our cost of sales include the recent volatility in the cost of steel and aluminum  our closure of our johnstown  pennsylvania facility and our efforts to continually reduce manufacturing costs at our other manufacturing facilities 
prices for steel and aluminum  the primary raw material components of our railcars  and surcharges on steel and railcar components were at historically high levels for the first half of and since then prices have dropped significantly 
substantially all of the contracts covering our current backlog are fixed rate contracts 
therefore  if material costs were to increase  we may not be able to pass on these increased costs to our customers 
operating income operating income represents total sales less cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  compensation expense under stock option and restricted share award agreements and plant closure charges 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  while railcar deliveries of  were  units below the level 
railcar deliveries for the year ended december  included delivery of  cars sold and delivery of  cars leased 
revenues for the year ended december  included million generated from contract termination fees resulting from a customer s reduction of a sales order 
the decrease in sales revenue for the year ended december  compared to levels was due primarily to lower sales of coal carrying cars driven by reduced industry demand 
coal loadings in have significantly decreased from levels  and the number of railcars in storage remains high 
recession driven reductions in demand for electricity  ample utility stockpiles  lower production and decelerating export activity contributed to the decline in coal activity during gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the corresponding margin rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the change in margin rate was driven primarily by a favorable product mix 
the contract termination fee of million also contributed to the margin rate improvement for selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
we took significant actions in to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses  however those reductions were partially offset by increases for severance costs of million  costs associated with the restatement of our financial statements of million  costs associated with the suspension or our salaried pension plan of million and expenses associated with the implementation of our erp system of million 
plant closure charges plant closure income for the year ended december  represent insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments related to employee termination benefits 
plant closure charges for the year ended december  represent the incremental costs associated with our decision  in december  to close our johnstown  pennsylvania manufacturing facility and included charges arising under our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as employment termination and related closure costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense income total interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense consisted of commitment fees on our credit facilities and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million as interest rates decreased compared to levels 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to a decrease of resulting from a change in the blended state rate  a decrease of for tax deductible goodwill  a decrease of for the impact of the rate change on deferred taxes  an increase of caused by a change in the valuation allowance  an increase of for nondeductible expenses and an increase of for the effect of other differences 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to an increase of caused by a change in the valuation allowance and an increase of for the effect of other differences  partially offset by a decrease of for tax deductible goodwill and a decrease of due to a change in the blended state rate 
the increase in the valuation allowance for was primarily due to plant closure charges that caused the pennsylvania deferred tax assets to increase resulting in a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to freightcar america was million for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of million from net income of million for the year ended december  for  our basic and diluted net income per share were both  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
for  our basic and diluted net income per share were both  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  while railcar deliveries of  were units below the level 
railcar deliveries for the year ended december  included delivery of  new cars sold and delivery of leased cars that have not yet been sold as well as delivery of used cars sold 
the decrease in sales revenue was due primarily to heightened competition and general market conditions as average railcar pricing declined between and this reflects a shift in product mix to car types with different material costs and  more importantly  pricing pressures dictated by softer demand 
our coal carrying railcars remain an essential part of our portfolio 
deliveries of our bethgon ii and autoflood iii coal carrying railcars comprised of our total railcar deliveries for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the corresponding margin rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the margin for was negatively impacted by material price increases and surcharges that we were unable to pass on to our customers due to fixed price sales contracts and the aggressive pricing environment in which we are operating 
for the year ended december   we were able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers with respect to of our railcar deliveries 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of our sales for and for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to reductions in outside professional services of million  contingent liabilities of million and incentive plan costs of million 
plant closure charges plant closure charges for the year ended december  represent the incremental costs associated with our decision  in december  to close our johnstown  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
as a result of the previously described global settlement  total plant closure costs incurred through december  were million 
these costs include charges arising under our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as employment termination and related closure costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense income total interest expense for each of the years ended december  and was million 
interest expense consisted of third party interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million as both interest rates and our cash balances decreased compared to levels 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to a decrease of for goodwill  a decrease of due to a change in the blended state rate  an increase of caused by a change in the valuation allowance and an increase of for the effect of other differences 
the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to plant closure charges in that caused the pennsylvania deferred tax assets to increase resulting in a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was slightly higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate due to the addition of a blended state rate and a increase caused by a change in the valuation allowance 
these increases were virtually offset by a decrease in the effective rate caused by the domestic manufacturing deduction 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to freightcar america was million for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of million from net income of million for the year ended december  for  our basic and diluted net income per share were both  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
for  our basic and diluted net income per share were and  respectively  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
net income for both and was significantly impacted by plant closure costs  with pre tax charges of million in and pre tax charges of million in liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity for the years ended december  and  was our cash generated by cash flows from operations in prior periods 
see cash flows 
on august   we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement with the lenders party thereto collectively  the lenders and lasalle bank national association lasalle as administrative agent as amended by the first amendment to second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of september  and the second amendment to second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of march  the credit agreement 
the proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement can be used to finance our working capital requirements through direct borrowings and the issuance of stand by letters of credit 
the credit agreement consists of a total facility of million senior secured revolving credit facility  including i a sub facility for letters of credit in an amount not to exceed million  and ii a sub facility for a swing line loan in an amount not to exceed million 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of i million or ii the borrowing base representing a portion of working capital  calculated as a percentage of eligible accounts receivable plus percentages of eligible finished inventory and semi finished inventory  less a million borrowing base reserve 
since our accounts receivable and inventory balances fluctuate considerably based on the cyclical nature of the business and the timing of orders  the amount available for borrowing also fluctuates considerably 
under the borrowing base calculation  the amount available for borrowing was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the credit agreement has a term ending on may  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable margin of between and depending on revolving loan availability as defined in the credit agreement 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and based on revolving loan availability 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by an unsecured guarantee made by jaix in favor of lasalle for the benefit of the lenders 
the credit agreement has both affirmative and negative covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and limitations on debt  liens  dividends  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the revolving credit agreement also provides for customary events of default 
as of december  and  we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we had million and million in outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit sub facility as of december  and  respectively which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the facility 
under the revolving credit facility  our subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends and transfer funds to the company without restriction 
on september   jaix entered into a credit agreement as amended by the first amendment to credit agreement dated as of march   the jaix credit agreement to be used to fund our leasing operations 
the jaix credit agreement consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the jaix credit agreement has a term ending on march  and bears interest at the eurodollar loan rate as defined in the jaix credit agreement plus for the first two years of the jaix credit agreement the revolving period and plus for the remainder of the term until the termination date 
jaix is required to pay an annual commitment fee of during the revolving period 
borrowings under the jaix credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of jaix 
additionally  america guaranteed the jaix credit agreement 
availability under the jaix credit agreement is based on a percentage of the eligible railcar leases as defined in the agreement held under the jaix credit agreement 
for the first two years the facility requires interest only payments  thereafter the amount drawn on each group of eligible railcars under lease is required to be repaid in equal installments at the  and month anniversaries of such leases the jaix credit agreement has both affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum tangible net worth  a requirement to deposit restricted cash and limitations on debt  liens  dividends  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the jaix credit agreement also provides for customary events of default 
as of december  and  we had no borrowings under the jaix credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our revolving credit facilities 
during  in response to competitive market conditions and the deterioration of the financial markets  the company selectively began to produce and offer railcars under operating lease arrangements with certain customers 
these term of the leases vary but generally is less than seven years 
the company also continually evaluates opportunities to package and sell its leases to its operating lease customers 
as of december   the value of railcars under operating leases was million  the investment in which was funded by cash flows from operations rather than the jaix credit agreement 
in  the company anticipates that it may continue to offer railcars under operating leases to certain customers and pursue opportunities to sell leases in its portfolio 
additional railcars under lease may be funded by cash flows from operations  borrowings under its credit facilities  or both  as the company evaluates its liquidity and capital resources 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows and our cash balances  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund working capital as demand for railcars increases  organic growth opportunities and cost reduction programs  including new plant and equipment  development of railcars  joint ventures and acquisitions  and these capital requirements could be substantial 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
we are also exploring product diversification initiatives and international and other opportunities 
our long term liquidity needs also depend to a significant extent on our obligations related to our pension and welfare benefit plans 
we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
benefits under our pension plans are now frozen and will not be impacted by increases due to future service 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the discount rate used on our pension and postretirement welfare obligations and expected return on pension plan assets 
our management expects that any future obligations under our pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 
as of december   our benefit obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan was million and million  respectively  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect to make no contributions relating to our defined benefit pension plans in we may elect to adjust the level of contributions to our pension plans based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
the pension protection act of provides for changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as minimum funding levels 
our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with the minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act 
funding levels will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plans are fully funded as that term is defined in the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 
based upon our operating performance  capital requirements and obligations under our pension and welfare benefit plans  we may  from time to time  be required to raise additional funds through additional offerings of our common stock and through long term borrowings 
there can be no assurance that long term debt  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments would be expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases material and component purchases total material and component purchases consist of non cancelable agreements with suppliers to purchase materials used in the manufacturing process 
purchase commitments for aluminum are made at a fixed price and are typically entered into after a customer places an order for railcars 
the estimated amounts above may vary based on the actual quantities and price 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  we also will have interest payment obligations on any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also paid consulting fees to one of our directors in the amount of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the agreement governing this arrangement expired in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the above table excludes million related to a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties at december  because the timing of the payout of these amounts cannot be determined 
we are a party to employment agreements with our president and chief executive officer  vice president  finance  chief financial officer and treasurer  as well as other members of our executive management team 
see item executive compensation 
we are also required to make minimum contributions to our pension and postretirement welfare plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding our expected contributions to our pension plans and our expected postretirement welfare benefit payments for cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities 
our net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current assets and liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our contract receivables  processing of bi weekly payroll and associated taxes  and payment to our suppliers 
our working capital accounts also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of certain events  such as the payment or non payment for our railcars 
as some of our customers accept delivery of new railcars in train set quantities  consisting on average of to railcars  variations in our sales lead to significant fluctuations in our operating profits and cash from operating activities 
we do not usually experience business credit issues  although a payment may be delayed pending completion of closing documentation  and a typical order of railcars may not yield cash proceeds until after the end of a reporting period 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included increases in cash due to changes in accounts receivable of million and increases in cash due to changes in income taxes of million  that were partially offset by decreases in cash due to changes in accounts payable of million  decreases in cash due to changes in inventories of million  and decreases in cash related to changes in accrued pension and postretirement benefits of million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included decreases in cash due to changes in accounts receivable of million  the cost of leased railcars held for sale of million and decreases in cash due to changes in customer deposits and other current liabilities of million that were partially offset by increases in cash due to changes in inventories of million and increases in cash due to changes in accounts payable of million 
cash flows for the year ended december  also included increases from net income of million and adjustments for non cash items  most significantly plant closure charges of million 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million and included increases from net income of million and adjustments for non cash items  most significantly plant closure charges of million  as well as increases in cash due to changes in inventories of million and increases due to changes in customer deposits and other current liabilities of million 
increases in cash flows for the year ended december  were partially offset by decreases in cash due to changes in accounts payable of million and decreases in cash due to changes in income taxes of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included the cost of purchasing securities available for sale of million  cost of railcars on operating leases produced or acquired of million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included the cost of railcars on operating leases produced or acquired of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and consisted primarily of capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   million of the million of total capital expenditures was used for cost reduction initiatives and the expansion of the production capacity to accommodate the manufacture of a new railcar type 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders  partially offset by a million investment in noncontrolling interest by our joint venture partner 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included million of cash dividends paid to our stockholders and million in deferred financing costs  partially offset by million of treasury stock issued for stock options exercised 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million and included million for stock repurchases  million to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and million related to deferred financing costs 
these were partially offset by the receipt of million for stock options exercised and million in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   capital expenditures were primarily cash outlays for our new erp system 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were primarily comprised of equipment expenditures to enable us to build wheel and truck assemblies in house and side sheet assemblies as well as cash outlays for our new erp system 
our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december  and included million of capital expenditures used for the expansion of production capacity to accommodate the manufacture of hybrid stainless steel aluminum coal carrying railcars 
excluding unforeseen expenditures  management expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in and will be used to maintain our existing facilities and update manufacturing equipment 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include long lived assets  goodwill  pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  the valuation reserve on the net deferred tax asset  warranty accrual and contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  under the provisions of asc property  plant and equipment  formerly  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held or used  we group a long lived asset or assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss for an asset group reduces only the carrying amounts of a long lived asset or assets of the group being evaluated 
our estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
our future cash flow estimates exclude interest charges 
we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
these changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
we routinely evaluate our manufacturing footprint to assess our manufacturing capacity and cost of production in an effort to optimize production at our low cost manufacturing facilities 
in december  we announced our planned closure of our manufacturing facility located in johnstown  pennsylvania and  as a result  we tested long lived assets at our johnstown facility for recoverability using estimated fair values 
we recorded impairment charges of  for land  building and improvements during in response to reduced industry demand for railcars  our manufacturing facility in roanoke  virginia ceased production of new railcars in july as a result  we tested long lived assets at its roanoke and danville facilities for recoverability as of december  using estimated future cashflows derived from the company s strategic plan 
in connection with the analysis  management had to make estimates regarding future sales volumes  gross margins and selling  general and administrative expenses  as well the split of future production levels between the company s two plants 
the analysis indicates that there was no impairment of the long lived assets for the roanoke  virginia and danville  illinois facilities as of december  because of the inherent uncertainty of its projections  management also performed sensitivity analyses around these estimates and determined that an impairment would not occur under a range of operating results  including shifts in the allocation of production  future railcar volumes and future gross margins 
we recorded impairment charges of  for leased railcars held for sale during and  during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded on our balance sheet both goodwill and intangible assets  which consist of patents 
we perform the goodwill impairment test required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january of each year 
no adjustments to goodwill were required based on the annual impairment tests as of january   and we test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our company below its carrying amount 
these events or circumstances include an impairment recorded under asc accordingly  we tested goodwill for impairment as of december  in connection with our testing of long lived assets at the johnstown facility for recoverability  in addition to performing our annual test as of january  we also tested goodwill for impairment as of december  in connection with an extended downturn in the market for new coal carrying railcars and our testing of long lived assets at our roanoke  virginia and danville  illinois facilities for recoverability 
no adjustments to goodwill were required based on the impairment tests as of december  or management estimates the valuation of the company which consists of one reporting unit using a combination of methods  as are considered appropriate in the circumstances  including discounted future cash flows  the prices of comparable businesses  recent transactions involving businesses similar to our company  and the company s market capitalization 
as of december   the industry in which our company operates is experiencing an extended cyclical downturn 
as a result  our company s recent and near term future earnings are below normalized levels 
however  our company has a sizable liquidity position relative to its book and market capitalization  as well as substantially no indebtedness  which serve to provide a floor to its valuation 
in light of these conditions  management does not believe that using the prices of comparable business or recent transactions that rely on earnings as a basis for the valuation provide a reasonable value for our company s net assets as of december  accordingly  management evaluated our company s discounted cash flows and market capitalization to provide a basis for the valuation of our company s net assets 
we concluded that the estimated fair value of our company s net assets exceeded the carrying value as of december  additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment if the fair value of our net assets were less than their carrying value 
the discounted cash flow method involves management making estimates with respect to a variety of factors that will significantly impact the future performance of the business  including future railcar volume projections based on an industry specific outlook for railcar demand and specifically coal railcar demand  estimated margins on railcar sales  and weighted average cost of capital or wacc used to discount future performance of our company 
because these estimates form a basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
we use industry data to estimate volume projections in our discounted cash flow method 
we believe that this independent industry data is the best indicator of expected future performance assuming that we maintain a consistent market share  which management believes is supportable based on historical performance 
our estimated margins used in the discounted cash flow method are based primarily on historical margins 
the wacc used to discount our future performance in the discounted cash flow method is based on an estimated rate of return of companies in our industry and interest rates for corporate debt rated baa or the equivalent by moody s investors service 
management estimated a wacc of for our december  goodwill impairment valuation analysis based on a targeted mix of equity and debt 
during the outlook for railcar demand and specifically coal carrying railcar demand worsened considerably 
as a result  small changes in our assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value of our net assets using the discounted cash flow method than in previous periods 
we compared the estimated fair value of our net assets using the discounted cash flow method in the base case scenario to three alternate scenarios including the impact of a negative adjustment to the volume projections  impact of a negative adjustment to the margin projections and impact of a increase in the wacc used in the discounted cash flow method 
each of these three alternate scenarios reduced the estimated fair value of our net assets using the discounted cash flow method by between and compared to the estimated fair value of our net assets in the base case 
the discounted cash flow method is the lower range of management s estimate of the fair value of our net assets  therefore each of the alternate scenarios lowered the lower range of management s estimate of the fair value of our net assets as of december  as a result  the lower range of management s estimate of the fair value of our net assets in some of the alternate scenarios is slightly below the carrying amount of our net assets as of december  although future results may differ from those used in the base case scenario  management believes that the discounted cash flow method using the base case scenario is the best estimate of the lower range of fair value of our net assets as of december  pensions and postretirement benefits we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets would be 
as permitted under asc formerly sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in our net periodic benefit cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic benefit cost 
we review the expected return on plan assets annually and would revise it if conditions should warrant 
a change of one percentage point in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which our pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined this rate to be  a decrease of from the rate used at december  a change of one percentage point in the discount rate would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december   and  we recognized consolidated pre tax pension cost of million  million and million  respectively 
pension costs for include accelerated recognition of unrecognized prior service cost of million resulting from the suspension of our pension plan for salaried employees 
pension costs for include special termination benefit costs of million resulting from our plant closure decision while pension costs for include pension plan curtailment losses and special termination benefit costs of million resulting from our plant closure decision see note  plant closure charges and note  employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these actions 
we currently expect to make no contributions to our pension plans during however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
the pension protection act of provided for changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as requiring minimum funding levels 
our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act 
funding levels will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
once the plan is fully funded as that term is defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized a consolidated pre tax postretirement welfare benefit cost of million  million and million  respectively 
postretirement welfare benefit costs for include contractual benefit charges of million resulting from our plant closure decision while postretirement welfare benefit costs for include plan curtailment losses and contractual benefit charges of million resulting from our plant closure decision see note  plant closure charges and note  employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these actions 
we currently expect to pay approximately million during in postretirement welfare benefits 
income taxes on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb standard no 
fin no 
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements  uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
this interpretation requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets  liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determinations  we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence would include the projection of future taxable income  the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
negative evidence would include any recent historical losses and any projected losses 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis  adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  a decline in sales or margins and loss of market share 
at december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million 
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  we considered both near term and longer term projections of operating results 
the railcar industry is in the midst of an extended cyclical downturn 
however  the railcar market has an established history of cyclicality based on significant swings in customer demand 
industry projections forecast this trend to continue  with a recovery in demand in and continuing for several years thereafter 
although realization of our net deferred tax assets is not certain  management has concluded that  based on the expected improvement in railcar demand and  therefore  operating results  we will more likely than not realize the full benefit of the deferred tax assets except for our net deferred tax assets in pennsylvania 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against net operating losses in pennsylvania 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for items that are reported for financial statement purposes in periods different from those for income tax reporting purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset amounts are based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the deferred tax liabilities and assets that we record relate to the enacted federal  illinois and virginia tax rates  since net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets arising under pennsylvania state law have been fully reserved 
a change in the rate of federal income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of illinois income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by million 
a change in the rate of virginia income taxes would increase or decrease our deferred tax assets by  product warranties we establish a warranty reserve for railcars sold and estimate the amount of the warranty accrual based on the history of warranty claims for the type of railcar  adjusted for significant known claims in excess of established reserves 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of one to five years 
revenue recognition we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from third parties 
we recognize revenue on new railcars when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk for any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
we do not record any returns or allowances against sales 
we recognize service related revenue from rebuilding and repairs when all significant rebuilding or repair services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
we recognize revenue for the entire transaction on transactions involving used railcar trades when the cash consideration is in excess of of the total transaction value and on a pro rata portion of the total transaction value when the cash consideration is less than of the total transaction value 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value at the date of receipt 
we recognize operating lease revenue on leased railcars on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we recognize revenue from the sale of railcars under operating leases on a gross basis in manufacturing sales and cost of sales if the railcars are sold within months as the manufacture of the railcars and the sale is within the month period specified by accounting guidance and represents the completion of the sales process 
we recognize revenue from the sale of railcars under operating leases on a net basis in leasing revenue as a gain loss on sale ie net of leased railcars if the railcars are held in excess of months as the sale represents the disposal of a long term asset 
we accrue for loss contracts when we have a contractual commitment to manufacture railcars at an estimated cost in excess of the contractual selling price 
we record amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling as part of sales and record related costs in cost of sales 
compensation expense under stock option agreements and restricted stock awards we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options and restricted stock 
at the date that an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the grant date 
the fair value of stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected exercise behavior  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements could be impacted 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies related to certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amounts of loss  in the determination of loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us based on our ongoing monitoring activities to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
if the amount of the actual loss is greater than the amount we have accrued  this would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded contingency losses of million which are included in our consolidated statements of income in selling  general and administrative expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued changes to asc  compensation retirement benefits formerly fasb staff position no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
asc now requires additional disclosures about plan assets for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the additional disclosures required by asc are effective for fiscal years ending after december  upon initial application  the provisions of asc are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes 
since asc requires enhanced disclosures without a change to existing standards relative to measurement and recognition  the adoption of asc will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as of january   we adopted the provisions of the fasb s changes to asc consolidation formerly  sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

asc requires us to present our interest in less than owned subsidiaries in which we retain control as a component of stockholders equity in the balance sheet and recharacterize the component formerly known as minority interest as noncontrolling interest 
asc also requires us to show the amount of net income attributable to both freightcar america and the noncontrolling interest on the face of the statement of operations and in the summary of comprehensive income 
the effect of adoption was an increase of  to total stockholders equity on our december  balance sheet  and a corresponding decrease to minority interests 
as of june   we adopted the provisions of the fasb s changes to asc  subsequent events sfas no 
 subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
specifically  asc sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of asc had no impact on our financial statements since management already followed a similar approach prior to the adoption of this standard 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements including  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
we have used the words may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  intend and similar expressions in this prospectus to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the cyclical nature of our business  adverse economic and market conditions  fluctuating costs of raw materials  including steel and aluminum  and delays in the delivery of raw materials  our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components  our reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales  the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of customer orders  the highly competitive nature of our industry  risks relating to our relationship with our unionized employees and their unions  our ability to manage our health care and pension costs  our reliance on the sales of our aluminum bodied coal carrying railcars  shortages of skilled labor  the risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings by our customers  the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations  the costs associated with being a public company  potential significant warranty claims  and various covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our businesses 
our actual results could be different from the results described in or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated 
given these uncertainties  you should not rely on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made 
we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws 
all of the forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a million revolving credit facility  which provides for financing of our working capital requirements and contains a sub facility for letters of credit and a million sub facility for a swing line loan 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had issued approximately million in letters of credit under the sub facility for letters of credit 
we also have a million revolving credit facility  which provides for the financing of the production or acquisition of railcars to be leased 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facilities will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
the production of railcars and our operations require substantial amounts of aluminum and steel 
the cost of aluminum  steel and all other materials including scrap metal used in the production of our railcars represents a significant majority of our direct manufacturing costs 
our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery of aluminum  steel and other materials  all of which are beyond our control 
any fluctuations in the price or availability of aluminum or steel  or any other material used in the production of our railcars  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  if any of our suppliers were unable to continue its business or were to seek bankruptcy relief  the availability or price of the materials we use could be adversely affected 
we currently do not plan to enter into any hedging arrangements to manage the price risks associated with raw materials  although we may do so in the future 
historically  we have either renegotiated existing contracts or entered into new contracts with our customers that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  current market conditions and competitive pricing have limited our ability to negotiate variable pricing contracts 
when raw material prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers  which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in passing on increases in the cost of aluminum and steel to our customers  a increase in the cost of aluminum and steel would increase our average cost of sales by approximately per railcar  which  for the year ended december   would have reduced income before income taxes by approximately million 
we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange risks as our general policy is to denominate foreign sales and purchases in us dollars
