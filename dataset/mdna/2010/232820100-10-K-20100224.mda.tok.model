item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in part i of this report 
currency amounts are in millions  except per share amounts 
percentages are approximate 
general we are a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sell our products to diverse major markets for aerospace  adhesives  automotive and industrial coatings  chemical intermediates  inks  mining and plastics 
sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management and are provided in our segment analysis 
we report net sales in four geographic regions north america  latin america  asia pacific and europe middle east africa 
the destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management s view of the business 
north america consists of the united states and canada 
latin america includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean islands 
asia pacific is comprised of asia  australia and the islands of the south pacific rim 
selling price changes and raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility 
global oil and natural gas costs in certain countries are highly volatile and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities 
discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion 
in addition  higher global demand levels and  occasionally  operating difficulties at suppliers  have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials 
the downturn in the global economy during the fourth quarter of led to a dramatic reduction in demand for our products across many of our industrial markets  which resulted in a significant decrease in earnings starting in the fourth quarter of beginning in january  we initiated various restructuring initiatives within our specialty chemical segments and corporate service functions 
we have substantially completed these actions to reduce our structural costs and the elimination of these positions as of december  in addition  in the second and third quarters of  we also initiated restructuring actions within our engineered materials segment to respond to lower demand due to inventory destocking and sharper than expected decline in business and regional jet build rates 
we estimate that the aforementioned structural cost reduction actions as well as actions initiated in prior years improved our results by approximately and the expected full year annualized rate of savings is approximately in addition to these restructuring initiatives  we implemented additional short term cost reduction and liquidity measures across our operations 
these short term measures include the implementation of furloughs in certain production facilities in order to better align our cost structure with the reduced demand in  a global salary freeze and bonus limitations  except as required by local law and contracts  and suspension of the company matching contributions to the k savings program for all us salaried and non bargaining employees effective may  we estimate that these short term actions improved our operating earnings by approximately

restructuring activities in accordance with our accounting policy  restructuring costs are included in our corporate unallocated operating results for segment reporting purposes consistent with management s view of its businesses 
details of restructuring initiatives are as follows in  we initiated restructuring actions across all segments and corporate functions 
these actions were taken in response to the downturn in the global economy  which especially impacted the automotive  construction and general industrial markets that we serve  and led to a significant reduction in our sales and operating profitability 
the following summarizes the details of the restructuring initiatives launched in  which resulted in of restructuring charges for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents we launched restructuring initiatives at several of our specialty chemical manufacturing locations  which resulted in restructuring charges totaling of which is associated with severance and other employee benefits and is associated with asset write downs and accelerated depreciation 
the manufacturing locations impacted by these initiatives are as follows closure of our manufacturing facility in la llagosta  spain and the transfer of manufacturing of most of the liquid coating resins products produced at the site to our facility in werndorf  austria 
transfer of the manufacturing of our powder coating resins product line from drogenbos  belgium to our manufacturing facility in bassano  italy and consolidate or eliminate supply chain  sales  marketing and administrative functions at the site 
transfer of the manufacturing of certain liquid coating resins products from our hamburg  germany site to our facility in werndorf  austria and consolidate or eliminate certain manufacturing  supply chain  and administrative functions at the site 
conversion of our manufacturing facility in antofagasta  chile into a blending and distribution facility to support the mining business and eliminate manufacturing functions at the site 
closure of our manufacturing facility in bogota  colombia 
the above manufacturing restructuring initiatives include the elimination positions 
we realized an estimated of cost savings in related to these initiatives and expect to realize an estimated of annualized pre tax savings in we launched restructuring initiatives across our engineered materials segment in response to inventory destocking by parts manufacturers that supply large commercial aircraft manufacturers as well as a sharper than expected decline in business and regional jet production rates 
these initiatives resulted in of restructuring charges for severance and employee benefits related to the elimination of positions 
we realized an estimated of cost savings in related to these initiatives and expect to realize an estimated of annualized pre tax savings starting in we launched several initiatives throughout in our specialty chemical segments and corporate functions across sales  marketing  manufacturing  supply chain  research and development  and administrative functions  including our initiative to establish a shared services center 
these initiatives resulted in of charges related to severance and employee benefits associated with the elimination of positions 
we realized of estimated cost savings in related to these initiatives and expect to realize of annualized pre tax savings starting in incremental annualized savings of and are projected to be realized in and  respectively 
the majority of the aforementioned initiatives are substantially complete as of december   with some components expected to be completed in waves throughout and the remaining reserve at december  of relating to restructuring initiatives is expected to be paid through details of restructuring initiatives are as follows in  as a cost reduction initiative and to align our cost structure to the declining demand environment at that time  we decided to restructure certain activities of our coating resins segment 
these initiatives resulted in restructuring charges of for the twelve months ended december   which primarily relates to severance for the eliminated positions 
savings of from these restructuring initiatives were realized in and of annualized pre tax savings were realized in these initiatives were completed in in  the remaining balance of was reversed 
all costs have been paid in full as of december  details of restructuring initiatives are as follows in  we initiated restructuring actions across our specialty chemicals segments to exit several mature product lines manufactured at our willow island  west virginia and wallingford  connecticut facilities 
as a result  we recorded total restructuring charges of in and these initiatives were completed in in  the remaining balance of was reversed 
all costs have been paid in full as of december  minimal savings from this restructuring initiative were realized in and annualized pre tax savings were realized in a cash benefit of from working capital reductions was realized through the first quarter of these benefits are net of lost earnings due to an annual sales reduction of during   and  we also recorded a net adjustment of   and  respectively  related to our and prior restructuring initiatives

liquidity and financial condition at december   our cash balance was compared with at year end cash flows provided by operating activities were compared with for primarily due to the favorable progress from our working capital initiative 
trade accounts receivable decreased principally reflecting the reduction in days outstanding from days at december  to days at december  inventory decreased reflecting the reduction in days outstanding from days at december  to days at december  accounts payable increased primarily due to increased purchases in the fourth quarter of versus the prior year quarter 
days outstanding were flat at december  compared to accrued expenses increased primarily due to increased accrued restructuring costs of on may   we contributed  of newly issued shares of our common stock to the four benefit plans included in our us pension master trust 
these shares were valued at approximately this contribution increased the funded status of each of the plans while significantly reducing our cash contributions 
cash flows used in investing activities were in compared to in during the first nine months of  we sold our polyurethane product line assets in europe and asia for cash proceeds totaling capital spending for was  which was mostly related to equipment purchases and work on our new carbon fiber line in greenville  south carolina  and our prepreg plant in china 
construction of the prepreg plant in china is now completed 
taking into account our expectations of the future business environment and the impact on the overall demand profile for carbon fiber  we decided in the first quarter of to delay the completion of the carbon fiber expansion project for at least eighteen months 
we will continue to evaluate the timing of the carbon fiber project as market conditions change 
our capital spending for is expected to be in the range of to net cash flows used by financing activities were in compared with in in  we had net debt repayments of during third quarter of  we completed an offering of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due we used those proceeds to purchase principal amount of our notes maturing october and principal amount of our notes maturing july to improve our debt maturity profile 
we have been focused on using the cash generated from our working capital reduction initiatives to lower our debt levels and successfully reduced outstanding borrowings under our primary credit agreement to zero at december  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were in on april  the board of directors reduced our quarterly dividend by in light of economic conditions 
as a result  we paid one quarterly cash dividend of per common share and three quarterly dividends of per common share in which aggregated to on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  payable on february  to stockholders of record as of february  also during  our majority owned subsidiary paid cash dividends to their minority shareholders which aggregated to credit facility in the second quarter of  we amended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility 
the amendment increases the maximum permitted ratio of total consolidated debt as defined to consolidated earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined through march   and also excludes up to of cash restructuring charges from the calculation of consolidated ebitda as it pertains to this covenant 
the maturity date remains june the amendment also significantly increased the interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the facility and replaces the existing facility fee with a commitment fee 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
debt offering on july  we closed on an offering of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due july   which resulted in in net proceeds after original issue discount and underwriting fees 
in addition  on june   we commenced offers to purchase our notes due october  and our notes due july  in july  we applied the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and corporate cash to repurchase principal amount of our notes due october  for a purchase price of plus accrued interest of and principal amount of our notes due july  for a purchase price of we

the repurchase of the notes through the tender offer resulted in a net loss of  including transaction costs  recognized in the third quarter of approximately remained authorized under our stock buyback program as of december  we did not repurchase any shares during we do not expect to repurchase any shares in given current economic conditions 
we believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation 
however  from time to time  based on such factors as local tax regulations  prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments  it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements  which may include debt service related disbursements 
we are required to meet financial ratios under our five year revolving credit agreement  including a maximum permitted ratio of total consolidated debt as defined to consolidated ebitda as defined and a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined to interest expense ratio 
complying with these ratios could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 
our ability to comply with the covenants will depend on our future operating performance  which may continue to be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
if we fail to comply with those covenants and terms  we will be in default 
in this case  we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance 
if we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers  the amounts outstanding under this agreement could be accelerated  and become immediately due and payable  and we would not be able to borrow any additional funds under the agreement while such default continued 
we are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the remainder of the current facility which matures in june we have no borrowings outstanding under the agreement as of december  our ability to fully utilize our revolving credit agreement can be limited by our actual calculated debt covenant ratio as compared to the maximum debt covenant ratio permitted under the agreement 
at december  the full amount of the facility is available to us  and we expect that the full amount will continue to be available based on our current forecasts 
with the significant amount of cash generated in  our priority will be to invest in the typical maintenance of business capital expenditures  pension contributions  and environmental remediation projects 
we will also consider expansion cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback margin improvement capital in our cash product lines 
in addition  if available at a reasonable price  we will pursue small technology based acquisitions for our growth product lines 
we also will continue to pursue debt reductions when available at a reasonable price 
we will also revisit the amount of our cash dividend when the global economy shows a consistent recovery 
we have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company 
inflation at this time is not considered significant although higher costs for energy and commodities could impact our future operating expenses and capital spending

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward and cross currency swap contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net notional amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows december  buy sell us dollar euro pound sterling australian dollar canadian dollar chilean peso others us dollar pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real norwegian krone taiwan dollar korean won others the favorable fair value of currency contracts  based on exchange rates at december   was assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
in september  we entered into of five year cross currency swaps and of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the five year notes and ten year notes into euro denominated liabilities 
the swaps included an initial exchange of on october  and will require final principal exchanges of on each settlement date of the five year and ten year notes october  and october   respectively 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us dollars to counterparties and received euros 
upon final exchange  we will provide euros to counterparties and receive us dollars 
the swaps also call for a semi annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed us dollar interest receipts 
with respect to the five year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the five year swaps 
with respect to the ten year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the ten year swaps 
both currency swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the 
table of contents future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany loans receivable we have with one of our subsidiaries 
in november  the five year cross currency swaps were de designated as cash flow hedges due to our decision to execute new off setting cross currency swaps two year cross currency swaps to lock in the euro forward exchange rate for the principal exchange on the five year cross currency swaps due on october  the net credit of recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the de designation date related to the five year swaps will be amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the related euro denominated intercompany loans 
prospective changes in the fair value of the five year swaps since the date of de designation are reported in earnings 
the two year cross currency swaps cover an identical notional amount of and also call for a semi annual exchange of fixed euro interest receipts for fixed us dollar interest payments 
with respect to the two year swaps  we will receive per annum on the euro notional amount and will pay per annum on the usd notional amount on each april and october  through the maturity date of the two year swaps  which is also on october  the two year cross currency swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the two year swaps is calculated each quarter with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
we expect the earnings impact related to future changes in the fair value of the two year cross currency swaps to substantially offset the earnings impact related to future changes in the fair value of the five year swaps 
at december   the fair value of the two  five  and ten year swaps were   and  respectively 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the total value of the hedging instruments referred to above 
a portion of the intercompany euro denominated loans payable of one of our us subsidiaries is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
from time to time we also enter into designated forward euro contracts to adjust the amount of the net investment hedge 
at december   we had no designated forward contracts 
commodity price risk we use natural gas forwards to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our north american manufacturing facilities 
the maturities of these swaps correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
these swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value  which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales through december as the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
for a detailed discussion on natural gas swaps  see critical accounting policies derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities  commodity price risk section below 
at december   we had outstanding natural gas forwards with a favorable fair value of assuming that year end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term variable rate borrowings and long term debt  including the current portion  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  of the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the contractual terms of the notes and observable market based inputs that include time value  interest rate curves  and credit spreads 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would increase decrease by approximately significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires recognition of compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments 
compensation cost for performance 
table of contents stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant which is the fair value 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash cash settled sars is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of settlement 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares stock settled sars and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
gaap also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives of the instruments  historical and implied volatility  dividend yield on our common stock  and risk free interest rates 
we also consider the probability that the options and stock settled sars will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder 
these assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
changes in assumptions from period to period may materially affect the amount of share based compensation cost we recognize in income 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study 
the study estimated our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency severity approach 
with this approach  the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis 
future claim frequency has been estimated using our claims history and the stallard manton epidemiological decay model  a widely used industry study 
the decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next to years 
our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience 
the estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation 
although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts  they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors 
a sustained change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
a sustained change in the average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 

table of contents defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the recovery is probable and related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the us  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
our us salaried pension plan was frozen on december  at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of our major us plans are matched against a yield curve encompassing such bonds to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
we discounted our us future pension and postretirement medical liabilities using a rate of and  respectively  at december  the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
a increase to the discount rate for our us pension plans would decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our pension plans would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by a increase to the discount rate for our postretirement medical plan would increase our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us postretirement medical plan would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by the expected rate of return on our us plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
a change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our us pension plans would increase or decrease our expected annual expense by the pension plans investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with gaap 
impairment of goodwill we have defined our segments as our reporting units 
our five business segments are coating resins  additive technologies  in process separation  engineered materials  and building block chemicals 
additive technologies and in process separation serve large  global industrial markets 
coating resins serves the large  global coatings market 
engineered materials serves principally aerospace markets 
building block chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets and view our customers 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
we initially use a market multiple approach a to estimate a range of fair values by reporting unit  and then use a discounted cash flow approach b if the market multiple approach indicates that a potential impairment might exist to refine and reaffirm the results of the first test 
the market multiple approach provides a straightforward  cost effective and relatively simple method to readily determine if an impairment might exist by utilizing ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization information by reporting unit multiplied by average current industry valuation factors or multiples to easily determine an estimated range of fair value 
due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units  we utilize a three year ebitda average of historical and forecasted ebitda for the reportable segment times the range of ebitda multiple factors 
the 
table of contents three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
the market multiple range utilizes an average lower and upper multiple limit based on recent industry acquisition average ebitda multiples paid by financial and strategic purchasers 
we obtain this information from a third party investment bank 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value using the low end of the range is close to  in our judgment  or below the reporting unit s carrying value  we refine the calculation using cash flows to calculate a point estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  as opposed to a range 
if the discounted cash flow approach yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the market multiple approach  we used an ebitda range of between x and x 
all of our reporting units passed step a with the exception of the coating resins reporting unit 
the coating resins ebitda of was a three year average of the actual  actual  and the budgeted ebitda amounts 
the market multiple approach step a for the coating resins reporting unit resulted in a fair value range of to since the range of the estimated fair values using the multiples was below the carrying value  we refined the estimate of the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach in accordance with our aforementioned policy which resulted in a fair value of  the discounted cash flow approach fair value exceeded the carrying value by  or  indicating that there was no impairment of coating resins goodwill 
the discounted cash flow approach considered a weighted average cost of capital wacc rate of as the discount rate and an estimated net cash flow for a ten year period from to the wacc calculation considered a risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premium 
the risk free rate of return equaled the yield on long term united states treasury bonds 
the cost of debt represented the yield of a bbb rated us bond 
the cost of equity included an estimate of the return on typical long term investments required to induce investment in a diversified portfolio of us publicly traded stocks adjusted for specific risk and size premiums of the reporting unit 
the risk premium reflects the specific risks associated with the current business and future performance estimates 
the cost of equity and debt were weighted based on the observed capital structures of companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow model also reflects a terminal value that assumes net cash flows will continue to grow at a rate of in perpetuity  which we believe is reasonable for this business 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
the discounted cash flows were based on a ten year projection  covering through the to projections take into account current macroeconomic conditions and reflect management s best estimate of the amount of time required before the business recovers from the current recessionary environment 
the to amounts were based on forecasted average revenue growth factor of approximately 
the projections included average annual capital expenditures of and net working capital increases corresponding to the revenue growth assumed 
we assumed an average tax rate of for the discounted cash flow approach which we believe is a realistic approximation of our future annual effective tax rate 
the following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the goodwill impairment 
the approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant 
critical factors change approximate increase decrease on fair value weighted average cost of capital weighted average cost of capital terminal value growth rate terminal value growth rate annual capital expenditures annual capital expenditures annual sales volume growth rate annual sales volume growth rate operating profit margin operating profit margin 
table of contents because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional non us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable and other noncurrent liabilities 
derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities we use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  interest rates and natural gas prices in north america 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
foreign currency risk we use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
we hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction 
all derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred  depending on the nature and 
table of contents effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
ineffectiveness  if any  in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings 
if the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value  we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income expense  net 
in november  we ceased designating our five year cross currency swaps as a cash flow hedge of the changes in the value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates on certain intercompany loans as noted below 
we did not terminate any other designated hedging relationships in there was no ineffectiveness in  or the earnings impact of cross currency swaps that are not designated as cash flow hedges and currency forward contracts that are used to economically hedge foreign currency assets or liabilities  if any  are recognized in other income expense  net during the term of the contracts 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge certain future cash flows from euro receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany loans receivable we have with certain subsidiaries against changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates 
the swaps fix the us dollar equivalent cash flows of these euro denominated intercompany loans and eliminate foreign exchange variability since the notional amounts of the swaps equal that of the loans  and all cash flow dates and interest rates coincide between the swaps and the loans  therefore no ineffectiveness is expected 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
in november  the five year cross currency swaps were de designated as cash flow hedges  due to our decision to execute new off setting cross currency swaps two year cross currency swaps to lock in the euro forward exchange rate for the principal exchange on the five year cross currency swaps due on october  the two year cross currency swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges 
all cross currency swaps are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
each period we record the change in the fair value of the ten year swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the ten year swaps  we reclassify an amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement to offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the remeasurement to us dollar of the euro intercompany loans 
we accounted for the five year swaps in this manner until de designation as cash flow hedges in november prospectively  upon de designation  the fair value of the two year and the five year cross currency swaps is calculated each quarter with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
we expect the earnings impact related to future changes in the fair value of the two year cross currency swaps to substantially offset the earnings impact related to future changes in the fair value of the five year cross currency swaps 
we accrue for all swaps the periodic net swap interest payments each period in the consolidated income statement 
we monitor the counterparty credit risk and the continued probability of the hedged cash flows as to amount and timing 
a portion of the intercompany euro denominated loans payable of one of our us subsidiaries is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
the portion of the remeasurement of the intercompany loan to the us dollar that relates to the amount designated as a hedge of our net investment is recorded as a translation adjustment 
commodity price risk we use natural gas forwards to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our north american manufacturing facilities 
these forward contracts  which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases  have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with the effective portion of the hedged item included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on an after tax basis 
gains and losses are reclassified into earnings  as a component of manufacturing cost of sales  in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
if the derivative is no longer highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows  subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense  net 
any ineffectiveness is recognized in other income expense  net in the current period 
if the hedging relationship is terminated we continue to defer the related gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item 
if the forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur we recognize the related gain or loss in other income expense  net in that period 
we did not terminate any hedges during  and all hedged transactions that were forecasted to occur in  and occurred as forecasted 
ineffectiveness during these years was insignificant 
our gas forwards and currency forwards are valued based on readily available published indices for commodity prices and currency exchange rates 

table of contents fair value measurements on january  we adopted a new accounting standard regarding fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities  as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a one year deferral of the new fair value measurement requirements for non financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the time of issuance and accordingly  we adopted the remainder of the new standard on january  included among our non financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are plant  equipment and facilities  goodwill  acquisition intangibles  and asset retirement obligations 
as a result of the adoption  a company must determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  interest rates  exchange rates  and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
all of our derivatives are valued based on level inputs 
our gas forwards and currency forwards are valued based on readily available published indices for commodity prices and currency exchange rates 
our cross currency swaps are valued using an income approach based on industry standard techniques 
this model includes a discounted cash flow analysis that nets the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments resulting from the swap 
the analysis is based on the contractual terms of the swaps including the period to maturity and observable market based inputs that include time value  interest rate curves  foreign exchange rates  implied volatilities  as well as other relevant economic measures 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads  to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties 
however  as of december   we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
at december   the favorable unfavorable fair value of the two  five  and ten year swaps were   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical inputs would have on the fair values of our cross currency swaps in total 
the approximate impact of the change in each critical input assumes all other inputs and factors remain constant
