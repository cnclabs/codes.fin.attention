impairment loss on goodwill and intangibles we make certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows  investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles 
based on actual and forecasted operating results  deterioration of the related customer base and loss of key employees  the americas segment recorded an impairment loss of million on the goodwill and intangibles during none in related to the march acquisition of kla 
interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in interest income decreased million reflecting lower average rates earned on higher average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million reflecting higher average levels of outstanding short term debt  primarily related to the million bermuda credit agreement  higher average rates  amortization of deferred loan fees and fees paid on our unused revolving credit facility 
we expect interest expense to increase substantially in as a result of the million bermuda credit agreement and a million term loan drawn down on february  in connection with the acquisition of ict  due in varying installments through february  impairment loss on investment in shps during  we received notice from shps that the shareholders of shps had approved a merger agreement between shps and shps acquisition  inc  pursuant to which the common stock of shps  including the common stock owned by us  would be converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
shps informed us that it believed the estimated fair value of the shps common stock to be equal to such per share amount 
as a result of this transaction and careful evaluation of our legal options  we believed it was more likely than not that we will not be able to recover the million carrying value of the investment in shps 
therefore  in the americas segment  we recorded a non cash impairment loss of million during the second quarter ended june  subsequent to the recording of the impairment loss  we liquidated our noncontrolling interest in shps by converting our shps common stock into cash for per share during the third quarter ended september  other income and expense other expense  net  was less than million in compared to other income  net  of million in this million net decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains  net of losses arising from the revaluation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities

the effective tax rate was for compared to an effective tax rate of for 
table of contents the increase in the effective tax rate of resulted mainly from our deemed change of assertion in the fourth quarter of regarding the permanent reinvestment of million of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings  which came about due to our borrowing of a million term loan on february  to close the ict acquisition and a million increase in estimated costs relating to the ict acquisition 
the proposed acquisition of ict  and the intent to fund the transaction through committed credit facilities was announced on october  under the provisions of asc  we determined that  based upon historical results  we could not retire the million term loan and pay the additional million in estimated costs without depleting excess us cash flows needed for future operations 
accordingly  a deferred tax expense of million  net of a release of a valuation allowance of million on foreign tax credits related to this change in assertion  was required to be recorded for financial reporting purposes in the fourth quarter of under asc the finance committee of our board of directors approved the repatriation of million of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings on february  all other undistributed earnings are still permanently reinvested in accordance with asc other items that increased the effective tax rate were an additional deferred tax liability of million  favorable foreign income tax rate differentials of million and the effects of the change in our permanent differences in the amount of million 
this increase in the effective rate was partially offset by a million change in the recognition of deferred tax assets primarily due to fluctuations in our valuation allowances  a reduction of million in foreign withholding taxes  and a million increase in the benefits from tax holiday jurisdictions 
the reduction of million in foreign withholding taxes is primarily a result of a reduction in the amount of dividends distributed by our philippine company to its foreign parent in the netherlands in when compared to generally  earnings associated with our investments in our subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested and no provision for income taxes on those earnings or translation adjustments has been provided 
the us department of the treasury released the general explanations of the administration s fiscal year revenue proposals in may these proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy  which may materially impact us taxation of international earnings  including our position on permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings 
in response to this release  we changed our assertion for with respect to the distribution of current earnings for one lower tier subsidiary and incurred withholding tax expense of million in with respect to this subsidiary s current earnings

in connection with our borrowing of the million term loan on february  to close the ict acquisition and a million increase in our estimate of costs relating to the ict acquisition  we were deemed to have had a change of assertion in the fourth quarter of regarding the permanent reinvestment of million of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings 
this change in assertion resulted in a deferred tax expense of million for the fourth quarter of  net of a release of a valuation allowance of million on foreign tax credits 
see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
the anticipated cash tax portion of the deferred tax expense of million is expected to be between million and million 
we believe that our resources including our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash generated from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements  continued expansion objectives  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future and any stock repurchases 
our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability

long term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of these long term liabilities with the taxing authority  therefore  amounts have been excluded from payments due by period

other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes  represent the expected cash payments due under pension obligations and minority shareholders of certain subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results recognition of revenue we recognize revenue pursuant to accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition 
we primarily recognize revenue from services as the services are performed  which is based on either on a per minute  per call or per transaction basis  under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenue for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other 
table of contents performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 
product sales  accounted for within our fulfillment services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
revenue from contracts with multiple deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if the deliverables in the contract s meet the criteria for such treatment 
certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple deliverables 
separation criteria included whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item  whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control 
fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis  which generally consists of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service  the contract s is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenue between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
if the separation criteria are met  revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement 
if the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables  all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting 
for these deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value  revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight line basis over the contract period  or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client  as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of trade account receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain clients  historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 
income taxes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
at december   we determined that a total valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
during  we determined that our profitability and expectations of future profitability of our foreign and domestic operations indicated that it was more likely than not that portions of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  we recognized a net increase in our u 
s 
deferred tax assets of million through a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to our anticipated utilization of our domestic net operating loss carry forward 
additionally  we determined that million of us deferred tax assets should be recognized in the fourth quarter of  since the foreign tax credits were now more likely than not to be realized due to our deemed change of assertion  regarding the permanent reinvestment of million of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings  which came about due to our borrowing of a million term loan on february  to close the ict 
table of contents acquisition and a million increase in estimated costs relating to the ict acquisition 
the proposed acquisition of ict and the intent to fund the transaction through committed credit facilities was announced on october  under the provisions of asc  we determined that  based upon historical results  we could not retire the million term loan and pay the additional million in estimated costs without depleting excess us cash flows needed for future operations 
accordingly  a deferred tax expense of million was required to be recorded for financial reporting purposes in the fourth quarter of under asc the finance committee of our board of directors approved the repatriation of million of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings on february  these increases in the u 
s 
deferred tax assets were partially offset by a net decrease of million in deferred tax assets when we placed an additional net valuation allowance on a foreign subsidiaries deferred tax assets related to the future use of their net operating losses 
the net reversal of the valuation allowance of million reduced the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for generally  earnings associated with our investments in our subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested and normally provisions for income taxes on those earnings or translation adjustments are not recorded 
our deemed change in assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of million of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings resulted in additional deferred tax liability and expense of million  net of a release of a valuation allowance of million on foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of in addition  in  we changed our intent with respect to the distribution of current earnings for one lower tier subsidiary 
we accrued withholding tax of million in with respect to this subsidiary s current earnings 
a provision for income taxes has not been made for the remaining balance of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december   as the earnings are permanently reinvested in foreign business operations in accordance with asc the us department of the treasury released the general explanations of the administration s fiscal year revenue proposals in may these proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy  which may materially impact us taxation of international earnings  including our position on permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings 
we continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns  and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
first  tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we adopted the provisions of uncertain tax positions in asc on january  and recognized a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
this adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings includes million related to transfer pricing penalties that may be assessed in connection with an income tax audit of our indian subsidiary 
upon adoption of fin as of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits including million of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously recognized as deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  a net increase of million from million as of december  this increase results primarily from proposed foreign audit adjustments  partially offset by the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and favorable exchange rates 
had we recognized these tax benefits  approximately million  million and million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in  and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to million due to expiration of statutes of limitations  audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
periodically  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in foreign currency 
we serve a number of us based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the philippines which is within our americas segment 
although the contracts with these clients are priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  which represent a foreign exchange exposure 
as of december   forward contracts to acquire a total of php billion throughout were outstanding with counterparties at a fixed price of million usd 
the forward contracts hedge approximately of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in php 
as of december   we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts of million  which will settle within the next months 
the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note financial derivatives of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
