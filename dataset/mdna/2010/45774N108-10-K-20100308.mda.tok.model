table of contents we believe that on hand cash combined with cash generated from operations  including our mexican operations  will be sufficient to meet our obligations such as debt service  tax payments  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months

however  future operating performance for the company is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and various other factors that are uncertain 
if the cash flows and other capital resources available to the company are insufficient to fund our debt and other liquidity needs  the company may have to take alternative actions that differ from the company s current operating plan 
innophos and its subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time seek to acquire or otherwise retire outstanding debt including publicly issued debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchanges or otherwise 
debt repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  company liquidity requirements  restrictive financial covenants and other factors applicable at the time 
the amounts involved may be material 
capital expenditures we spent million in on projects that were capitalized 
additionally  we spent million in on maintenance projects that were expensed during the year 
there were no planned major non annual maintenance expenses in these amounts compare to million of capitalized projects and million of maintenance projects that were expensed during of which million was related to planned major non annual maintenance 
we expect our capital expenditures to continue to run below depreciation levels 
however  as purchase accounting effects on step up depreciation and useful lives mature  the per annum depreciation expense will trend down towards sustaining capital expenditure levels 
based on assets currently in service  we expect annual depreciation to decline by approximately million over the next years compared to levels  with approximately half of that decline expected in and the remainder equally split between and this depreciation decline will be partially offset by the depreciation of future capital expenditures including our enterprise resource planning upgrades
