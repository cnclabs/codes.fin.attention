item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our existing debt service obligations 
our annual debt service obligations until november  when our revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature  will be primarily limited to interest and principal payments on multiple series of privately placed senior notes and our outstanding debt securities  with an aggregate principal amount of million  and on borrowings under our billion credit facility 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or new acquisitions to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility when it matures in  our private notes when they mature on various dates between and or our debt securities when they mature in and if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations  we expect to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction at all or on a timely basis or on terms  and for proceeds  that are acceptable to us 
these transactions may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect  however  our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to timely refinance our obligations on acceptable terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and could cause us to reduce or discontinue our planned operations 
the costs that we pay for metals fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control  and such fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results  particularly if we cannot pass on higher metal prices to our customers 
we purchase large quantities of aluminum  carbon  alloy and stainless steel and other metals  which we sell to a variety of end users 
the costs to us for these metals and the prices that we charge customers for our products may change depending on many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  raw material costs  customer demand levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations and surcharges imposed by our suppliers 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers with higher selling prices but we may not always be able to do so 
we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and delivery requirements of our customers 
our customers typically purchase products from us pursuant to purchase orders and typically do not enter into long term purchase agreements or arrangements with us 
accordingly  we purchase metal in quantities we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based on information derived from customers  market conditions  historic usage and industry research 
commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment 
during periods of rising prices for metal  we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers immediately 
in addition  when metal prices decline  this could result in lower selling prices for our products and  as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices  lower margins 
consequently  during periods in which we sell this existing inventory  the effects of changing metal prices could adversely affect our operating results 
our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns 
demand for our products is affected by a number of general economic factors 
a decline in economic activity in the us and other markets in which we operate could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the us economy technically entered an economic recession in december and the economic recession spread to many global markets in beginning in the fourth quarter and throughout  the metals industry  including service centers and reliance  felt the effects of the recession 
both demand for our products and pricing levels declined rapidly and significantly 
in addition to reducing our direct business activity  many of our customers were not able to pay us amounts when they became due  further affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
although demand and pricing levels stabilized somewhat during the second half of  demand for our products continues to be at low levels 
we have little visibility as to the duration of the economic downturn  which may cause our financial condition to worsen from current levels and may continue to threaten the financial viability of our customers and their ability to pay us 
the prices of metals are subject to fluctuations in the supply and demand for metals worldwide and changes in the worldwide balance of supply and demand could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
for example  in the past few years  china has significantly increased both its consumption and production of metals and metal products 
initially  china s large and growing demand for metals significantly affected the metals industry by diverting supply to china and contributing to the global increases in metal prices 
with china s increased production of metals  it has become a significant buyer of natural resources and a net exporter of certain metals 
while these developments can affect global pricing  china has not yet had a significant impact on us pricing or the pricing for our products 
future changes in china s general economic conditions or in its production or export of metals could cause fluctuations in metal prices globally  which could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
due to the recent global recession  us mills have significantly reduced their production capacities by idling production lines in an effort to more closely match supply with current demand 
domestic carbon steel mills were operating at less than of capacity in early  which we believe supported pricing levels well above pricing levels that would have developed if capacity had not been reduced 
since mid year  mill capacity rates have increased to about by the end of led mainly by increased demand for flat rolled products by the auto industry 
pricing for most products has experienced modest increases since mid year mostly driven by increasing raw material costs as opposed to demand 
however  if mills continue to increase production without a corresponding increase in demand  prices may decline 
global mills  including those in china  may react more irrationally than domestic mills 
additionally  significant currency fluctuations in the united states or abroad could negatively impact our cost of metals and the pricing of our products 
a decline in the dollar relative to foreign currencies may result in increased prices for metals and metal products in the united states and reduce the amount of metal imported into the us as imported metals become relatively more expensive 
if the value of the dollar improves relative to foreign currencies  this may result in increased metal being imported into the us that may pressure existing domestic prices for metal 
in addition  when prices for metal products in the us are lower than in foreign markets  metals may be sold in the foreign markets rather than in the us  reducing the availability of metal products in the us  which may allow the domestic mills to increase their prices 
we operate in an industry that is subject to cyclical fluctuations and any downturn in general economic conditions or in our customers specific industries could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the metals service center industry is cyclical and impacted by both market demand and metals supply 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states or other countries  or the public perception that these may occur  could decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our pricing 
for example  the recent economic recession significantly impacted our revenue levels due to both demand and pricing level deterioration beginning in the fourth quarter and through the first half of this deterioration also impacted our gross profit and net income levels as we had to lower our selling prices to our customers faster than we received lower cost metal into our inventory 
our inventory costs are currently in line with our replacement costs  allowing us to improve our gross profit margins to more normal historical levels in the second half of however  if either demand or pricing were to decline further  this could further reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
we sell many products to industries that are cyclical  such as the non residential construction  semiconductor  energy and transportation industries  including aerospace 
although many of our direct sales are to sub contractors or job shops that may serve many customers and industries  the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  demand for the finished goods manufactured by customers in these industries  which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy  domestic exchange rates  energy prices or other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to accurately project the product needs of our customers over varying lead times or if there is a limited availability of products through allocation by the mills or otherwise  we may not have sufficient inventory to be able to provide products desired by our customers on a timely basis 
in addition  if we are not able to diversify our customer base and or increase sales of products to customers in other industries when one or more of the cyclical industries that we serve are experiencing a decline  our revenues  gross profit and net income may be adversely affected 
we compete with a large number of companies in the metals service center industry  and  if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenues  gross profit and net income may decline 
we compete with a large number of other general line distributors and specialty distributors in the metals service center industry 
competition is based principally on price  inventory availability  timely delivery  customer service  quality and processing capabilities 
competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have more established brand names in the local markets that we serve 
accordingly  these competitors may be better able to withstand adverse changes in conditions within our customers industries and may have greater operating and financial flexibility than we have 
to compete for customer sales  we may lower prices or offer increased services at a higher cost  which could reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the significantly lower demand levels during have escalated competitive pressures  with service centers selling at substantially reduced prices  and sometimes at a loss  in an effort to reduce their high cost inventory and generate cash 
these competitive pressures could continue to increase as demand and pricing remain at low levels or fall further 
any increased competitive pressure could cause our revenues  gross profit and net income to decline further 
if we were to lose any of our primary suppliers or otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of necessary metals on a timely basis  we may not be able to meet our customers needs and may suffer reduced sales 
we have few long term contracts to purchase metals 
therefore  our primary suppliers of carbon steel  alloy steel  stainless steel  aluminum or other metals could curtail or discontinue their delivery of these metals to us in the quantities we need with little or no notice 
our ability to meet our customers needs and provide value added inventory management services depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of high quality metal products from our suppliers 
if our suppliers experience production problems  lack of capacity or transportation disruptions  the lead times for receiving our supply of metal products could be extended and the cost of our inventory may increase 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our customary suppliers  we may not be able to obtain these metals from acceptable alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules 
even if we do find acceptable alternative suppliers  the process of locating and securing these alternatives may be disruptive to our business  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customers needs and reduce our sales  gross profit and net income 
in addition  if a significant domestic supply source is discontinued and we cannot find acceptable domestic alternatives  we may need to find a foreign source of supply 
dependence on foreign sources of supply could result in longer lead times  increased price volatility  less favorable payment terms  increased exposure to foreign currency movements and certain tariffs and duties and require greater levels of working capital 
alternative sources of supply may not maintain the quality standards that are in place with our current suppliers that could impact our ability to provide the same quality of products to our customers that we have provided in the past  which could cause our customers to move their business to our competitors or to file claims against us 
there has been significant consolidation at the metal producer level both globally and within the us this consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers available to us  which could result in increased metals costs to us that we may not be able to pass on to our customers and may limit our ability to obtain the necessary metals to service our customers 
the number of available suppliers may be further reduced if the current economic downturn continues 
lower metal prices and lower demand levels caused certain mills to reduce their production capacity and  in many cases  to operate at a loss  which could cause one or more mills to discontinue operations if the losses continue over an extended period of time or if the mill cannot obtain the necessary financing to fund its operating costs 
we rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them 
we rely on mill certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metal received from our suppliers for resale and generally  consistent with industry practice  do not undertake independent testing of such metals 
we rely on our customers to notify us of any metal that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplying mill 
although our primary sources of products have been domestic mills  we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate 
in the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill certifications or customer specifications  we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers 
however  such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub standard products and possible losses of customers 
moreover  there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill certifications 
in such circumstances  we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry  or do not carry sufficient  insurance 
if we do not successfully implement our acquisition growth strategy  our ability to grow our business could be impaired 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully complete any acquisitions or integrate any other businesses into our operations 
if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates or are otherwise unable to complete acquisitions  we are unlikely to sustain our historical growth rates  and  if we cannot successfully integrate these businesses  we may incur increased or redundant expenses 
moreover  any additional indebtedness we incur to pay for these acquisitions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in september  we amended our billion credit facility mainly to adjust certain financial covenants through june  the amendment also includes certain restrictions on our uses of cash for acquisitions  among other things 
through june   we are limited to cash consideration for an acquisition of one times our latest twelve months ebitda 
this restriction could prevent us from completing certain large acquisitions that are attractive to us  or could increase the cost of the acquisition if we are required to obtain a waiver or further amendment from our bank group to approve the acquisition 
because of the recent economic downturn and uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of the eventual recovery  it may be difficult to reach agreement with potential sellers on the appropriate valuation of target companies  which may delay or cancel potential acquisitions 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 
historically  we have expanded both through acquisitions and internal growth 
since our initial public offering in september  we have successfully purchased more than businesses 
from to september  we acquired businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and  although we placed acquisitions on hold in because of the poor economic climate  we expect to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
risks we may encounter in acquisitions include the acquired company may not further our business strategy  or we may pay more than it is worth  the acquired company may not perform as anticipated  which could result in an impairment charge or otherwise impact our results of operations  we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to continue purchasing products from us  we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner  we may significantly increase our interest expense  leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or assume existing debt of an acquired company  which  among other things  may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings  we may have multiple and overlapping product lines that may be offered  priced and supported differently  which could cause our gross profit margins to decline  our relationship with current and new employees  customers and suppliers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify risks that could negatively impact our financial condition  we may lose anticipated tax benefits or have additional legal or tax exposures if we have prematurely or improperly combined entities  we may face contingencies related to product liability  intellectual property  financial disclosures  tax positions and accounting practices or internal controls  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties  our management s attention may be diverted by transition or integration issues  and we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or a number of acquisitions 
as a decentralized business  we depend on both senior management and our key operating employees  if we are unable to attract and retain these individuals  our ability to operate and grow our business may be adversely affected 
because of our decentralized operating style  we depend on the efforts of our senior management  including our chairman and chief executive officer  david h 
hannah  our president and chief operating officer  gregg j 
mollins  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  karla lewis  as well as our key operating employees 
we may not be able to retain these individuals or attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our corporate officers or most of our key employees  so they may have less of an incentive to stay with us when presented with alternative employment opportunities 
the compensation of our officers and key employees is heavily dependent on our profitability and in times of reduced profitability this may cause our employees to seek employment opportunities that provide a more stable compensation structure 
in addition  our senior management and key operating employees hold stock options that have vested and may also hold common stock in our employee stock ownership plan 
these individuals may  therefore  be more likely to leave us if the shares of our common stock significantly appreciate in value 
the loss of any key officer or employee will require remaining officers and employees to direct immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement 
our inability to retain members of our senior management or key operating employees or to find adequate replacements for any departing key officer or employee on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business 
we are subject to various environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations  which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  wastewater discharges  underground storage tanks and solid and hazardous waste disposal at or from our facilities 
our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations  including those concerning occupational injury and illness  employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints 
we are also subject to customs and exporting laws and regulations for international shipment of our products 
environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations are comprehensive  complex and frequently changing 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
we may be subject from time to time to administrative and or judicial proceedings or investigations brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters  employee safety and health issues or customs and exporting issues 
proceedings and investigations with respect to environmental matters  any employee safety and health issues or customs and exporting issues could result in substantial costs to us  divert our management s attention and result in significant liabilities  fines or the suspension or interruption of our service center activities 
some of our current properties are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use 
the location of these properties may require us to incur environmental expenditures and to establish accruals for environmental liabilities that arise from causes other than our operations 
in addition  we are currently investigating and remediating contamination in connection with certain properties we have acquired 
our international presence has grown  so the risk of incurring liabilities or fines resulting from non compliance with customs or export laws has increased 
we are currently investigating and remediating potential violations  most of which occurred at companies prior to reliance acquiring them  however  we may incur fines or penalties for any such violations 
future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their enforcement  new laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to us  could result in material environmental or export compliance or remedial liabilities and costs  constrain our operations or make such operations more costly 
proposed legislation aimed at regulating and taxing carbon emissions may impact both the prices we pay for materials and the volume of business from our customers involved in fossil fuel exploration 
we purchase large quantities of metal from mills whose production costs may increase because of proposed increases in taxation on carbon emissions as a byproduct of the milling process 
such regulation  if passed  may consequently result in higher prices charged to us by the mills for most every type of metal that we sell 
the price that we pay for utilities such as electricity to run our warehouse equipment and fuel to run our delivery trucks and forklifts may rise as well due to increased taxation on the companies who produce and supply these commodities 
we may not be able to fully pass on these costs to our customers without a resulting decline in order volumes  which may adversely impact our profits 
carbon related regulation may also negatively impact domestic exploration efforts 
should such a reduction in domestic exploration occur  we would expect to see a resulting slow down in sales to our energy end market in general  thus negatively impacting our revenues  gross profit and net income 
our operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue fluctuating  depending on the season 
many of our customers are in seasonal businesses  including customers in the construction and related industries 
in addition  our revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of increased vacation days and holiday closures for various customers 
consequently  you should not rely on our results of operations during any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
ongoing tax audits may result in additional taxes 
reliance and our subsidiaries are undergoing various tax audits 
these tax audits could result in additional taxes  plus interest and penalties being assessed against reliance or any of our subsidiaries and the amounts assessed could be material 
damage to our computer infrastructure and software systems could harm our business 
the unavailability of any of our primary information management systems for any significant period of time could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  our ability to deliver products to our customers when needed  collect our receivables and manage inventory levels successfully largely depend on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
through information management systems  we provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel  improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results 
difficulties associated with upgrades  installations of major software or hardware  and integration with new systems could lead to business interruptions that could harm our reputation  increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability 
in addition  these systems are vulnerable to  among other things  damage or interruption from power loss  computer system and network failures  loss of tele communications services  operator negligence  physical and electronic loss of data  or security breaches and computer viruses 
we have contracted with third party service providers that provide us with backup systems in the event that our major information management systems are damaged 
the backup facilities and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate 
the value of your investment may be subject to sudden decreases due to the potential volatility of the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including variations in our quarterly results of operations and our leverage position  as well as a general economic downturn 
during the last two years our stock price was extremely volatile reaching an all time high of per share in july and then declining to per share in november other factors may include matters discussed in other risk factors and the following factors changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors or changes in estimates that we provide in our quarterly earnings release and conference call  developments affecting our company  our customers or our suppliers  changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting our business  press releases  earnings releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry  inability to meet securities analysts and investors quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance  a decline in our credit rating by the rating agencies  the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  sales of our common stock by large shareholders or insiders  general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in addition  stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
in the past  some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation  regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful  could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs  making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance 
we test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method 
under this method  the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
significant changes in any one of the assumptions made as part of our analysis  which could occur as a result of actual events  or further declines in the market conditions for our products or our common stock could significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
principal shareholders who own a significant number of shares may have interests that conflict with yours 
periodically  we have one or more shareholders that control or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
individually or together  they may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval 
in deciding how to vote on such matters  these shareholders may be influenced by interests that conflict with yours 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may adversely impact your rights as a holder of reliance common stock 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring reliance  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock and the rights of our shareholders 
we are authorized to issue  shares of preferred stock  no par value  with the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such stock to be determined by our board of directors  without a vote of the holders of common stock 
our board of directors could grant rights to holders of preferred stock to reduce the attractiveness of reliance as a potential takeover target or make the removal of management more difficult 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings and establish a staggered or classified board of directors 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
in addition  our credit facility and the provisions of our senior private notes and debt securities contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions 
risks related to our debt securities because our senior debt securities and the related guarantees are not secured and are effectively subordinated to the rights of secured creditors  the debt securities and the related guarantees will be subject to the prior claims of any secured creditors  and if a default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the debt securities or the related guarantees 
the notes and the guarantees are unsecured obligations  ranking equally with other senior unsecured indebtedness 
the indenture governing the notes  as well as our credit facility and private placement notes  permit us and the subsidiary guarantors to incur additional secured or unsecured debt under specified circumstances 
if we or the subsidiary guarantors incur additional secured debt  our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors securing such debt will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors 
in the event of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of either reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors  assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the notes and guarantees only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full 
holders of the notes will participate in any remaining assets ratably with all of the respective unsecured and unsubordinated creditors of reliance and the subsidiary guarantors  including trade creditors 
if reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors incurs any additional unsecured obligations that rank equally with the notes  including trade payables  the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed as a result of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up 
if we do not have sufficient assets to pay all creditors of these entities  a portion of the notes outstanding would remain unpaid 
the guarantees may be unenforceable due to fraudulent conveyance statutes and  accordingly  the holders of our debt securities may not have a claim against the subsidiary guarantors 
the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law 
however  a court in some jurisdictions could  under fraudulent conveyance laws  further subordinate or void the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor if it found that such guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder  delay or defraud creditors  or such subsidiary guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee and that the subsidiary guarantor was any of the following insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the guarantee  engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed that it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay such debts at maturity 
if a court were to void the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor as the result of a fraudulent conveyance  or hold it unenforceable for any other reason  holders of the notes would cease to have a claim against that subsidiary guarantor on its guarantee and would be creditors solely of reliance and any other subsidiary guarantor whose guarantee is not voided or held to be unenforceable 
the guarantees will be released under certain circumstances 
the debt securities will be guaranteed by any subsidiary guarantor for so long as such subsidiary guarantor is a borrower or a guarantor of obligations under our credit agreement and our private notes 
in the event that  for any reason  the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor terminate as a borrower or guarantor under our credit agreement and our private notes  that subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture and its guarantee of the notes will terminate 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to the notes of a series upon legal defeasance of such series or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as it relates to such series 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to each series of notes in connection with any sale or other disposition by reliance of all of the capital stock of that subsidiary guarantor including by way of merger or consolidation or other transaction such that after giving effect to such transaction such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a domestic subsidiary of reliance 
if the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor as a guarantor terminate or are released  the risks applicable to our subsidiaries that are not guarantors will also be applicable to such subsidiary guarantor 
we depend on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the notes 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries may have priority over your claims with respect to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries 
we will therefore be dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations under the notes and to meet our other obligations 
generally  creditors of our subsidiaries will have claims to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries that are superior to the claims of our creditors  except to the extent the claims of our creditors are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the notes 
as of december   reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if reliance expands its international presence at a greater pace than it expands its us presence  a smaller percentage of its consolidated assets may be subject to the guarantee obligations 
in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of reliance  the holders of our notes may not receive any amounts with respect to the notes until after the payment in full of the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors 
we are permitted to incur more debt  which may intensify the risks associated with our current leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt 
subject to certain limitations  our existing credit facility and private notes permit us to incur additional debt 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit the amount of additional debt that we may incur 
if we incur additional debt  the risks associated with our leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt  will increase 
the provisions in the indenture that governs the notes relating to change of control transactions will not necessarily protect the holders of our notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction 
the provisions contained in the indenture will not necessarily afford the holders of our notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction that may adversely affect them  including a reorganization  restructuring  merger or other similar transaction involving reliance 
these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or  even if they do  may not involve a change of the magnitude required under the definition of change of control repurchase event in the indenture to trigger these provisions  notably  that the transactions are accompanied or followed within days by a downgrade in the rating of the notes 
except in the event of a change of control  the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a takeover  recapitalization or similar transaction 
reliance may not be able to repurchase all of the notes upon a change of control repurchase event 
we will be required to offer to repurchase certain outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the indenture dated november  see exhibit included in this annual report on form k 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes in cash at such time or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time 
under the terms of our credit facility  we are prohibited from repurchasing the notes if we are in default under such credit facility 
ratings of our notes may change and affect the market price and marketability of the notes 
the notes are rated by moody s investors service inc and standard poor s 
such ratings are limited in scope  and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes  but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued and subsequently updated or affirmed 
an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency 
there is no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered  suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if  in each rating agency s judgment  circumstances so warrant 
it is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with future events  such as future acquisitions 
holders of our notes have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings 
any lowering  suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the notes 
in addition  any decline in the ratings of the notes may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms

item properties as of december   we maintained more than metals service center processing and distribution facilities in states  and in belgium  canada  china  mexico  singapore  south korea and the united kingdom  a sales office in france  and our corporate headquarters 
we are in the process of building additional facilities  including a metals service center in malaysia that is expected to begin operations in the second quarter 
all of our service center facilities are in good or excellent condition and are adequate for our existing operations 
these facilities generally operate at about of capacity based upon a hour seven day week  with each location averaging about two shifts operating at full capacity for a five day work week 
during  however  we had many employees working reduced hours or locations running at reduced shifts in response to low demand levels  which lowered our capacity utilization to about 
we lease of our processing and distribution facilities with total square footage of approximately million 
total square footage on all company owned properties is approximately million 
in addition  we lease our corporate headquarters in los angeles  california and several of our subsidiaries lease other sales offices or non operating locations 
the leases expire at various times through and the aggregate monthly rent amount is approximately million 
item legal proceedings 
from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions 
generally  these actions arise out of our normal course of business 
we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to the business 
we expect that these matters will be resolved without having a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we maintain liability insurance against risks arising out of our normal course of business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview marked reliance s seventieth year as a metals service center company and fifteenth year as an nyse listed public company 
also marked what we consider to be the most difficult operating environment that our company has ever experienced and also  we believe  the worst in our industry for at least the last seventy years 
typically we focus on maximizing profitability of our existing businesses and continued profitable growth through both acquisitions and internal initiatives 
during we shifted our focus to maximizing liquidity  mainly by reducing inventory levels and using the cash to pay down debt 
in addition to significant uncertainty regarding the extent of the downturn on our business levels in  financial markets were unstable creating uncertainty as to continued credit availability for us  our customers and our suppliers 
we were successful in our efforts as we generated record cash flow from operations of million in and paid down approximately million of debt  providing us with ample liquidity not only to survive the recession  but to emerge as a financially stronger and leaner company 
in we once again outperformed our peers with pre tax income of million 
due to our focus on debt reduction  we suspended acquisition activity during however  we do not believe that we missed any opportunities that fit our acquisition criteria during this period and we are now well positioned to execute our acquisition strategy as opportunities arise 
we believe there may be opportunities to acquire companies in our industry that are attractive to us beginning in the second half of we continued our internal growth activities during with million of capital expenditures that included opening service centers in new geographic areas as well as expanding or enhancing existing facilities and equipment 
we also took advantage of opportunities to expand our customer base arising from certain actions of other service centers in the us economy technically entered an economic recession in december  which quickly spread to the global economy 
our business activity and profitability continued at record levels until november  which was later than many other companies felt the severe impact of the downturn 
we believe our strategic product  geographic and customer diversity somewhat delayed the effects of the downturn on our financial results  especially with our minimal exposure to the auto and residential construction markets 
however  we were not immune 
significant and rapid declines in both prices and demand for our products began in the fourth quarter and continued through the first half 
we were deeply affected in the second quarter mainly due to steep price reductions for carbon steel products sold primarily to the non residential construction market  which represents about one third of our business 
further  we had completed our largest acquisition to date based on transaction value on august  this acquisition increased our debt by billion and also intensified the effect of the unprecedented declines in inventory values and demand as our newly acquired subsidiary historically carried higher levels of inventory than reliance  mainly of carbon steel products 
steel producers reacted to the downturn in demand by reducing production capacity to less than in order to somewhat maintain pricing levels 
although prices for most metal products  and especially carbon steel products  declined significantly during this period  without the discipline exercised by the mills we believe prices may have fallen much lower than they did  resulting in an even greater negative impact on the financial results of reliance and the metals industry in general 
domestic pricing levels were also supported because of relatively low imports into the us during due to the weak dollar 
service centers  including reliance  went into a destocking mode  trying to convert inventory to cash 
because demand was falling as fast as pricing  service centers were chasing the price down  sometimes selling product at a loss in a very competitive market 
this significantly reduced our gross profit margins 
both demand and pricing began to stabilize somewhat  albeit at low levels  late in the second quarter 
in the third quarter  mill prices began to increase and we began purchasing more metal from mills as our inventory levels better matched our shipment levels 
this better aligned our inventory costs with current replacement cost  allowing us to focus on improving our gross profit margins rather than chasing business to maximize cash flow 
the third quarter carbon steel price increases were mainly driven by improved auto demand  which caused some domestic mills to restart production that then increased supply and pressured pricing in the fourth quarter 
however  raw material costs then began to increase and the mills announced price increases for the first quarter  which helped to maintain our selling prices and improve our gross profit margins in the fourth quarter 
beginning in the fourth quarter  we began to aggressively reduce our operating costs 
our most significant operating expense is personnel costs and in reaction to reduced activity levels we have reduced our workforce by since september we believe that we are quick to react to changes in business conditions and that our response to such changes allows us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we generated record cash flow from operations of million in as of december   our net debt to total capital ratio was down to from at december  in we repaid million of debt and had only million borrowed on our billion credit facility at december  in september we amended our credit facility mainly to provide relief under our interest coverage ratio covenant and also extended billion of our commitments to november from november from now through november  we have million of scheduled debt maturities 
we expect to fund these obligations with our cash flow from operations and availability on our credit facility 
we believe our consistent focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification allowed us to weather the recent economic crisis better than most of our competitors and that this will provide longer term growth opportunities for us 
we expect to further grow the company in both through accretive acquisitions  if available  and internal growth opportunities that enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we believe the somewhat improved business climate and credit markets should result in acquisition opportunities that are attractive to us beginning later in the year 
we will evaluate these opportunities and pursue those that meet our disciplined acquisition criteria 
our capital expenditure budget is million  a good portion of which will be invested in new or expanded facilities and state of the art equipment that will allow us to continue to provide superior customer service and the highest quality of processed metals to our existing customers as well as to expand our market share 
demand for us has improved in january and february over the second half of and we expect that demand overall will recover slowly as the year progresses 
we expect prices to remain at or near current levels at least through the first quarter and believe that there must be a meaningful improvement in demand before we will see any material improvements in pricing 
with demand and pricing at relatively stable levels  we will again focus on servicing our customers in a manner that allows us to maximize profitability 
we expect our gross profit margins to be in a range of to  consistent with our historical results over the past ten years 
further declines in demand or pricing for our products could further reduce our gross profit margins 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which then contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars  which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure other than for profit based compensation  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is typically much greater than the effect of volume changes 
in addition  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
acquisitions on september   through our newly formed singapore company reliance metalcenter asia pacific  pte  ltd 
rmap  we acquired the assets  including the inventory  machinery  and equipment  of the singapore operation of hln metal centre pte 
ltd 
rmap focuses primarily on supplying metal to the electronics  semiconductor  and solar energy markets 
we entered this market primarily to support existing us customers that moved to or expanded their operations in asia 
net sales of rmap for the year ended december  and during the period from september  through december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of pna group holding corporation  a delaware corporation pna  for a total transaction value of approximately billion 
we funded the acquisition with proceeds from a new million senior unsecured term loan and borrowings under our existing billion syndicated revolving credit facility 
pna s subsidiaries include the operating entities delta steel  inc  feralloy corporation  infra metals co  metals supply company  ltd  precision flamecutting and steel  inc and sugar steel corporation 
we operate pna as six distinct businesses that process and distribute primarily carbon steel plate  bar  structural and flat rolled products with steel service centers throughout the united states  as well as four joint ventures with six additional service centers in the united states and mexico 
pna s net sales for the year ended december  and the five months ended december  were approximately billion and million  respectively 
effective april   through our subsidiary service steel aerospace corp  we acquired the business of dynamic metals international  llc dynamic based in bristol  connecticut 
dynamic was founded in and is a specialty metal distributor 
dynamic has been merged into and currently operates as a division of service steel aerospace corp 
headquartered in tacoma  washington 
this strategic acquisition expanded reliance s existing service steel aerospace specialty product offerings in the northeastern area of the us the all cash purchase price was funded with borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
dynamic s net sales for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
internal growth activities despite the continued deterioration of the economy in  we maintained our focus on organic growth by opening new facilities  building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of million 
we continued to expand our geographic presence in with phoenix metals company opening a new location in richmond  virginia  earle m 
jorgensen company starting construction on a new facility in nusajaya  malaysia  which is scheduled to open in  and chatham steel corporation buying land for a new facility to be built in ironton  ohio 
operations in existing markets were also expanded during  with pdm steel service centers moving into a newly constructed  larger and more efficient facility in las vegas  nevada and precision strip expanding and improving an existing facility in kenton  ohio 
during we also consolidated and closed a few small operations that did not impact our ability to service our customers 
we expect to continue to expand our existing operations in  with new facilities planned  or currently under construction  for yarde metals in limerick  pennsylvania  reliance metals canada in edmonton  alberta  canada  and earle m 
jorgensen in orlando  florida and memphis  tennessee

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our annual consolidated sales of billion were down from  with a decrease in tons sold and a decrease in our average selling price per ton sold 
tons sold and average selling price per ton sold amounts exclude the toll processing sales of precision strip  inc and feralloy corporation 
our sales for and included billion and million  respectively  from the pna companies that we acquired on august  our average selling prices during have declined mainly because of the significant mill price reductions for most products that we sell compared to prices for most carbon steel products were rising significantly during the first half of and reached record levels in july subsequently  prices fell rapidly beginning in the fourth quarter and continued to decline through the first half of in the second half there were modest increases in mill prices for certain products 
our diverse product mix somewhat tempered the effect of the carbon and stainless steel price declines  as aluminum products made up about of our sales  and our average selling price for aluminum products was down only in compared to same store sales  which exclude the sales of our acquisitions  were billion in  down from  with a decrease in our tons sold and an decrease in our average selling price per ton sold 
the decline in our same store tons sold was due to the lower demand in all markets that we sell to  mainly because of the global economic recession that significantly impacted our business activity beginning in the fourth quarter 
according to the metals service center institute  tons sold in were down approximately for the metals service center industry in north america compared to the decline in the same store average selling price per ton sold of was lower than the for the entire company mainly due to a change in our product mix towards a higher proportion of carbon steel products resulting from the acquisition of pna 
since carbon steel products typically have lower selling prices than other products that we sell and were most impacted during  they contributed to the relatively higher reduction in our consolidated average selling price per ton sold 
cost of sales 
our total cost of sales decreased in to billion compared to billion in the decrease in cost of sales in compared to is due to decreases in tons sold resulting from the global economic recession along with decreases in mill prices  which impact our costs  that began in the fourth quarter and continued to decline through the first half of our cost per ton sold decreased  relatively consistent with the decrease in our average selling price per ton sold of 
also  our lifo reserve adjustment  which is included in our cost of sales and  in effect  reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs  resulted in a credit  or income of million in compared to a charge  or expense of million in the lifo credit or income that we recorded in was the result of significant decreases in our inventory costs at year end as compared to year end levels  especially for carbon steel products 
our lifo reserve as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross profit 
total gross profit decreased to billion for  compared to billion in our gross profit as a percentage of sales in was compared to in during the first half of  we were selling higher cost inventory into a declining price market that significantly reduced our gross profit margins 
beginning in the third quarter  mill prices began to increase and we began purchasing more metal from mills as our inventory levels better matched our shipment levels 
this better aligned our inventory costs with current replacement costs resulting in improved gross profit margins 
our lifo reserve adjustment was income  or a credit  to cost of sales in  compared to expense  or a charge  in which also impacted our gross profit margins 
see cost of sales above for discussion of our lifo reserve adjustments 
our and gross profit margins were also impacted by our acquisition of pna on august  the pna companies have historically operated at lower gross profit levels than the reliance companies 
the pna companies have also historically carried higher levels of inventory than the reliance companies  which further pressured their gross profit margins during as it took the pna companies longer to reduce their high cost inventory and replace it with inventory at current replacement cost 
we expect to improve the margins of the pna companies to levels more consistent with reliance s historical levels as demand and pricing improve 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for decreased million  or  from and were as a percentage of sales  up from in on a same store basis  our expenses decreased million  or from primarily due to lower compensation expense levels 
our expenses as a percent of sales increased substantially because of our lower sales compared to our cost structure is highly variable  with about of our expenses being personnel related 
in  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees  or  with most reductions occurring in the first half of the year 
since september   we have reduced our workforce by approximately  employees  or 
in addition to the headcount reductions  we have many employees working reduced hours resulting in additional savings 
furthermore  throughout our workforce  employees have a significant portion of compensation tied to profitability 
because of the lower profitability levels in our compensation expense has declined 
additionally  our expenses include million related to potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  an increase of million from in  we wrote off million of customer receivables as uncollectible  an increase of million compared to our allowance for uncollectible accounts at december  was million 
although we anticipate some further receivable write offs  we believe that our allowance is adequate to absorb any such losses 
depreciation and amortization expense for of million increased from the increase was mainly due to our acquisition of pna and due to depreciation of our capital expenditures 
operating income 
operating income was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating income of million and an operating profit margin of 
the lower sales amounts in have significantly reduced our operating income 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million  a decrease of million from million in although we significantly increased our borrowings for the billion purchase of pna in august  we were able to quickly reduce our debt level because of our strong cash flows over the past fifteen months as we aggressively reduced our working capital levels 
other income expense  net was income of million in compared to expense of million in  a net increase in income of million 
higher interest and dividend income on company owned life insurance policies as well as related policy redemption gains resulted in million higher income from life insurance policies in compared to also  results were impacted with foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was compared to for the decrease in our effective rate is mainly due to the same type of permanent items having a much greater impact on our effective rate in as a result of lower income levels and due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in net income 
net income attributable to reliance in was million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the lower sales  gross profit and operating income dollars generated as a result of the global economic recession 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our annual consolidated sales of billion were our highest ever  up from  with an increase in tons sold and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
our acquisition of pna on august   contributed significantly to the increase in our sales levels 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
for the first ten months of we experienced some overall weakening in our end markets from levels but beginning in november the decline in demand became much more dramatic as general economic conditions weakened across all of our end markets 
as previously discussed  mill pricing for carbon steel products increased rapidly in the first half of  almost doubling during that period 
we were able to pass these increases on to our customers through increased selling prices during that time  causing a significant increase in our average selling price per ton sold over levels 
then  beginning in october  carbon steel prices came spiraling down  ending the year at a level approximately where they started the year 
the decreases occurred in a more compressed time period than the increases  which  when combined with the demand deterioration  caused significant competitive pressures that caused us to reduce our selling prices faster than our costs were declining 
in addition  our average selling price was impacted by the change in product mix resulting from our acquisition of pna  with carbon steel products representing of our total sales  compared to in because carbon steel product prices are generally lower than aluminum  alloy and stainless steel prices  the increase in our consolidated average selling price in was substantially less than the increase in our same store average selling price 
cost of sales 
our total cost of sales increased in to billion compared to billion in the increase in cost of sales in compared to is due to the pna acquisition in august and higher metal costs 
our cost per ton sold increased approximately  relatively consistent with the change in our average selling price per ton sold 
furthermore  our lifo reserve adjustment was significantly larger in than in our year end lifo reserve adjustment resulted in expense of million during  compared to million in the significant increases in carbon steel prices in as compared to year end levels resulted in net lifo expense for the year 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in the mill pricing volatility experienced in was the primary driver of our gross profit margins 
during the first half of when the mills were announcing significant price increases for carbon steel products  we were able to increase our selling prices to our customers before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory  which allowed us to expand our gross profit margins in that period 
however  when the mills rapidly reduced prices beginning in october  we had to significantly reduce our selling prices to remain competitive 
service centers went into an inventory destocking mode  attempting to clean out higher cost inventory and replace it with lower cost inventory 
doing this in an environment of rapidly deteriorating customer demand caused extreme competitive pressure in the industry that had a very negative impact on our gross profit margin  especially as we were also in a destocking mode 
our gross profit margin was also impacted by our acquisition of pna on august st 
excluding the pna companies from our results would have resulted in a gross profit margin of 
expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and general cost increases 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were  lower than the period 
the overall increase in average carbon steel pricing in helped to lower the ratio of our expenses as a percent of sales 
also  the acquisition of the pna companies favorably impacted our sg a expenses as a percentage of sales as they have historically operated at lower operating expense levels than the reliance companies 
during the fourth quarter we reduced our workforce by about in addition to other personnel cost saving actions in reaction to the deteriorating business activity levels in our industry 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions  along with depreciation expense of our capital expenditures 
amortization expense increased million  or  because of the amortization of our intangibles from our and acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating income of million and an operating profit margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  however  our operating income margins deteriorated because of our lower gross profit margins in our operating income reflects the strong environment for pricing that existed during most of and our ability to take advantage of this environment  along with the effect of the deteriorating business climate in our fourth quarter results 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase is mainly due to borrowings to fund our billion acquisition of pna on august  offset by lower interest rates during income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was compared to for the decrease in our effective rate was mainly due to a lower state rate because of the pna acquisition that shifted a portion of our taxable income to states with lower rates 
net income 
net income attributable to reliance in was million compared to million during the increase was primarily due to higher gross profit and operating income dollars generated from the higher commodity prices during as well as the impact of our acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities at december   our working capital was million  down from billion as of december  in  we continued to significantly reduce our working capital and generated million of cash flow from operations  compared to million in  with million of this amount generated in the fourth quarter 
in the environment of declining demand and pricing that we experienced from november through most of  working capital needs decreased significantly 
the majority of our million of cash flow generated from operations came from working capital reductions 
decreases of million in our accounts receivable balance and million in our fifo inventory level were the primary contributors to our record cash flows from operations during to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding dso to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are the two most significant elements of our working capital 
as of december   our dso rate was approximately days  unchanged from december  we calculate our dso as an average of the most recent two month period 
although our dso rate has stayed relatively unchanged from last year  our accounts receivable balance has decreased significantly from december  due to lower sales levels in in response to the rapid decline in both demand and pricing  we focused on inventory reduction with a decrease of million  or  in our fifo inventory balance in however  our shipment levels fell even more rapidly than we could reduce our inventory balance resulting in an inventory turn rate during of about times or months on hand  calculated on fifo inventory amounts  compared to our rate of times or months on hand 
our inventory turns were also impacted by our acquisition of pna  as pna historically turned inventory at lower rates than reliance 
we expect those inventory turns to improve as we continue to focus on those businesses  and as business conditions improve 
when commodity prices or demand begin to improve  we expect to finance increases in working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
investing activities capital expenditures were million in compared to million during because of our focus on liquidity and our uncertainty as to business conditions  we reduced our capital projects but still invested in growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities and to add or upgrade equipment in addition to meeting ongoing maintenance requirements 
our capital expenditures are budgeted at approximately million  which includes several growth activities to enhance existing facilities and equipment and also includes purchases of various existing leased facilities 
financing activities our strong cash flow from operations funded our reductions of outstanding debt of million and dividends to our shareholders of million in on february   our board of directors declared the first quarter cash dividend of 
per share 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders for consecutive years 
in may  our board of directors amended and restated our stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our common stock  of which  shares remain available for repurchase as of december  repurchased shares are treated as authorized but unissued shares 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in we repurchased approximately  and  shares of our common stock in and  respectively  at an average cost of and per share  respectively 
since initiating our stock repurchase plan in  we have repurchased approximately  shares at an average cost of per share 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are generally our internally generated funds from operations and our revolving credit facility 
cash flow provided by operations was million in compared to million in our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations as of december  was million  down from billion as of december  on august   we increased our borrowings by approximately billion to finance the acquisition of pna through cash consideration and the related repayment or refinancing of pna s outstanding indebtedness 
we funded this by raising million from a senior unsecured term loan and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
on september   we amended our billion revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants 
our interest coverage ratio requirement was reduced to a minimum times from times and our leverage ratio requirement was reduced to a maximum of from a maximum of until june   at which time these ratios adjust back to the pre amendment levels 
with the amendment  our pricing was adjusted to market rates 
restrictions were placed on certain uses of cash including cash used for acquisitions  dividends  investments and stock repurchases through june  additionally  with the amendment of our credit facility  we extended the maturity date by one year from november to november for billion of commitments 
concurrent with the amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility  we also paid off the remaining balance on our term loan of million with million of cash on hand and million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
over the past fifteen months  we have paid down approximately billion of debt with cash flow from operations resulting in a cash position of approximately million as of december  as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings on our billion revolving credit facility 
our net debt to total capital ratio was as of december   down from our year end rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
on november  we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities  which are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect  wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and any entities that become such subsidiaries during the term of the indenture collectively  the subsidiary guarantors 
none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations 
in april  these notes were exchanged for publicly traded notes registered with the securities and exchange commission 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding private placement notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in early january  million of these notes matured and were paid off 
we also had two separate revolving credit facilities for operations in canada with a combined credit limit of cad million as of december  there were no borrowings outstanding on these credit facilities as of december  and december  in january  the credit facilities were combined into one facility with a credit limit of cad million 
various other separate revolving credit facilities are in place for our operations in asia and for our operations in the united kingdom with total combined outstanding balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our billion syndicated revolving credit facility and senior notes collectively require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and include change of control provisions  among other things 
the interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was approximately times compared to the debt covenant minimum requirement of times interest coverage ratio is calculated as net income attributable to reliance plus interest expense and provision for income taxes and plus or minus any non operating non recurring loss or gain  respectively  divided by interest expense 
the leverage ratio as of december  calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement was compared to the debt covenant maximum amount of leverage ratio is calculated as total debt  inclusive of capital lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt 
the minimum net worth requirement as of december  was million compared to the reliance shareholders equity balance of billion 
additionally  all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the indenture and the private placement notes 
the subsidiary guarantors also guaranteed the borrowings under the term loan prior to its repayment and termination 
the subsidiary guarantors  together with reliance  are required collectively to account for at least of the company s consolidated ebitda and of consolidated tangible assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately of our total consolidated ebitda and approximately of total consolidated tangible assets as of december  we were in compliance with all other debt covenants at december  we have million of debt obligations coming due before our credit facility expires in november we are comfortable that we will have adequate cash flow and capacity on our revolving credit facility to fund our debt obligations as well as our working capital  capital expenditures  growth and other needs 
we expect to continue our acquisition and other growth activities in the future and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  subject to the restrictions on the use of cash described above 
if we were to pursue a significant acquisition that could not be funded under our existing credit facility  we would consider using our equity as consideration or raising additional funds from debt or equity markets 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively 
the letters of credit related to insurance policies  construction projects  and outstanding bonds 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total interest is estimated using applicable rates as of december  for our outstanding fixed and variable rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities 
the majority of our inventory purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s post retirement benefit plans for the next ten years 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
furthermore  the impact of the current economic recession was so significant on our business during that our period to period fluctuations experienced throughout the year were not representative of typical seasonal trends experienced in the past 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to billion as of december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs  making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance 
we test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method 
under this method  the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
we perform the required annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of november of each year 
no impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended december   or impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and the current changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to commodity prices  demand and future growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  considerable declines in the market conditions for our products from current levels as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports along with current economic pressures impacting that customer or industry 
accounts that we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories a significant portion of our inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals industry as well as fluctuations in our product mix and on hand inventory levels 
at december  cost on the first in  first out fifo method exceeds our lifo value of inventories by million 
the calculation of lifo does not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments  except at interim reporting periods 
furthermore  considering that our current inventory values as reflected in our financial statements on a lifo basis are below fifo costs  valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market is also not subject to significant estimates or judgments 
however  we do maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities  provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the reconciliation includes such factors as historical and industry multiples  industry performance statistics  and recent comparable transaction pricing among other information 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
this strategy also limits our exposure to commodity prices to our inventories on hand 
in an environment of increasing material costs our pricing usually increases as we try to maintain the same gross profit percentage and typically generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
in periods where demand deteriorates rapidly and metal prices are declining significantly in a compressed period of time  such as during the last three months of and first half of  a portion of our inventory on hand may be at higher costs than our selling prices  causing a significant adverse effect on our gross profit and pre tax income margins 
however  when prices stabilize and our inventories on hand reflect more current prices  our gross profit margins tend to return to more normalized levels 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations is predominantly in their local currency  the currency effects of translating the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses do impact earnings and resulted in approximately million of gains in and million of losses during during our primary exposure to foreign currency rates related to our canadian operations that had certain outstanding intercompany borrowings denominated in the us dollar that were not hedged 
this exposure was significantly reduced at the end of as the related balances were paid off 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
as of december   our total variable interest rate debt outstanding amounted to approximately million  which was primarily comprised of the borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on million of debt would result in approximately million of additional interest expense on an annual basis
