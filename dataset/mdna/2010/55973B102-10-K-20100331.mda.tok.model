item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our actual production and sales for any period are less than the corresponding volume of derivative contracts for that period including reductions in production due to operational delays  or if we are unable to perform our activities as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
in addition  our oil and gas financial derivative activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including any circumstance in which a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement  the arrangement is imperfect or our derivative policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned 
under the terms of our senior credit facility with bank of montreal  the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we will be allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited  and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volume 
if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties  potentially triggering earlier than anticipated repayments of any outstanding debt obligations and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities 
there is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  which would reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties 
if capitalized costs exceed future cash flows  we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value 
any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities  but will reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
additional write downs could occur if oil and gas prices decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results 
because our properties currently serve  and will likely continue to serve  as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities  a write down in the carrying values of our properties could require us to repay debt earlier than we would otherwise be required 
it is likely that the cumulative effect of a write down could also negatively impact the value of our securities  including our common stock 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
we review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties 

table of contents drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
please read item a 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below for a discussion of the uncertainties involved in these processes 
our costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment malfunctions  failures or accidents  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools  loss of drilling fluid circulation  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas and fluids  fires and natural disasters  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  adverse weather conditions  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
if any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field  we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field  or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field  either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
our proved reserves and related pv as of december  have been reported under new sec rules that went into effect on january  the estimates provided in accordance with the new sec rules may change materially as a result of interpretive guidance that may be subsequently released by the sec 
we have included in this report certain estimates of our proved reserves and related pv at december  as prepared consistent with our independent reserve engineers interpretations of the new sec rules relating to disclosures of estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
these new rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december  these newly adopted rules will require sec reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on month unweighted first day of the month average pricing 
the sec has not specifically reviewed our reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves and related pv at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could ultimately differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
we may be limited in our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves under the new sec rules 
another impact of the new sec reserve rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
this new rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program on our undeveloped properties 

table of contents our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves 
to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds for capital expenditures 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation 
there is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable  particularly in light of the current economic environment 
the use of seismic data and other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the same area  will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercially viable quantities 
moreover  the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects 

table of contents we cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we own an ownership interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  the operations of these non operated properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production  revenues and reserves 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  the approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of suitable technology 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future acquisitions may yield revenue or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in acquiring producing properties  we will assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact  and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well or retain a third party consultant 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for  and development  production and acquisition of  oil and natural gas reserves 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings  cash generated by operations and preferred and common stock equity offerings 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures with the sale of equity  asset sales  cash flow from operations and current and new financing arrangements with our banks 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the amount of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
we may need to seek additional financing in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all  depending on market conditions 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
also  our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  materially change our business  approve and distribute dividends  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create or acquire additional subsidiaries  incur indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  incur liens  and enter into agreements regarding swap and other derivative transactions 

table of contents restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the restated credit agreement with our lenders contains certain negative covenants that among other things  restrict our ability to  with certain exceptions incur indebtedness  grant liens  make certain payments  change the nature of our business  dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or enter into mergers  consolidations or similar transactions  make investments  loans or advances  pay cash dividends  unless certain conditions are met and are subject to a basket of million per year available for payment of dividends on preferred stock  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the restated credit agreement with our lenders also requires the company to satisfy certain affirmative financial covenants  including maintaining an ebitdax to interest ratio of not less than to  a debt to ebitdax ratio of not more than a to for the fiscal quarters ending march   june   and september   and b to for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter  and a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liability of not less than to we are also required to enter into certain commodity price hedging agreements pursuant to the terms of the credit facilities 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  alternative sources of financing or reductions in expenditures 
we cannot assure you that such waivers  amendments or alternative financings could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business 
as of march  our outstanding indebtedness was approximately million 
our substantial debt could have important adverse consequences for holders of our common stock  including the following it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  including debt service requirements under our credit agreements  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and other general corporate purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow is committed to payments on our debt  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  such as future capital expenditures  we are more vulnerable to price fluctuations and to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business or industry is more limited  our ability to capitalize on business opportunities  and to react to competitive pressures  as compared to others in our industry  may be limited our obligations under our senior credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  and any failure to meet our debt obligations would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
prc williston llc  our majority owned subsidiary  sharon resources  inc and triad hunter  llc  our wholly owned subsidiaries  and our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  eureka hunter pipeline  llc  have each guaranteed the performance of all of our obligations under the senior credit facility  and we have collateralized our obligations under the senior credit facility through our grant of a first priority security interest in our ownership interest in prc williston  llc  sharon resources  inc  triad hunter llc  eureka hunter pipeline  llc and substantially all of our oil and gas properties  subject only to certain permitted liens 
our ability to meet debt obligations under the senior credit facility will depend on the future performance of our properties  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors  many of which we are unable to control 
our failure to service this debt could result in a default under the credit facilities  which could result in the loss of our ownership interest in prc williston  llc  sharon resources  inc  triad hunter llc  eureka hunter pipeline llc and our oil and gas assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget 
we may  from time to time  encounter difficulty in obtaining  or an increase in the cost of securing  drilling rigs  equipment and supplies 
in addition  larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms 
if we are unable to acquire access to such resources  or can obtain access only at higher prices  our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on pipelines owned by others to transport and sell our natural gas production 
disruption of  capacity constraints in  or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas 
in many instances  we transport our natural gas to market by utilizing pipelines owned by others 
if pipelines do not exist near our producing wells  if pipeline capacity is limited or if pipeline capacity is unexpectedly curtailed or disrupted  we may have to reduce sales of our production of gas because we do not have facilities to store excess inventory 
if this occurs  our revenues will be reduced  and our unit costs will also increase 
in addition  if pipeline gas quality requirements change for a pipeline  we might be required to install additional processing equipment  which could increase our costs 
if this should occur  the pipeline could curtail our gas flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance 
new technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete 
the oil and gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology  including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies 
as competitors use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  competitors may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
one or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us 
if we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards  our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations  and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we may ultimately face 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses to protect against the risks we foresee 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry certain types or amounts of insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  then that accident or other event could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have completed several recent acquisitions  and there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our contractual and financial obligations thereunder 
in mid we acquired sharon resources  inc in a stock acquisition and increased our ownership interest in the east chalkley field in louisiana 
more significantly  in february  we closed the triad acquisition and in doing so incurred certain significant contractual and financial obligations  including our commitments under the senior credit facility and with respect to the series b preferred stock issued to triad and the series c cumulative perpetual preferred stock that represented a portion of the acquisition financing  and other contractual obligations with respect to the ongoing operations of triad 

table of contents although we have consummated the triad transaction  there is no assurance we will be able to have sufficient equity capital or borrowing capacity to operate the acquired assets post closing 
there is also no assurance that we can successfully assimilate triad s properties  operations and personnel into our organization 
we do not have a significant operating history and  as a result  there is a limited amount of information about us on which to make an investment decision 
in july  we acquired our initial exploratory drilling prospects  and in november we commenced drilling activities 
in december  we commenced production from our first oil and gas prospects  and in february we received our first revenues from oil and gas production 
in february we acquired a average working interest in producing oil fields and approximately producing wells located in the williston basin in north dakota at which point we began to receive revenue from associated oil and gas production 
since that time  we have expanded secondary recovery operations in the williston basin properties in anticipation of drilling additional producing wells in the future 
beginning in to present  we have actively participated with approach resources corporation in the drilling of approximately wells located in crockett county  texas 
beginning in the last quarter  we participated with goodrich petroleum corporation in five successful wells located in nacogdoches county  texas 
on september   we acquired sharon resources  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of calgary based sharon energy ltd  bringing an inventory of drilling projects in addition to three exploration and evaluation professionals 
in addition  on september   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with centurion to acquire for million all of centurion s ownership interest in the east chalkley unit in cameron parish  louisiana 
this property acquisition was completed on october  and is operated by our company 
our triad acquisition recently closed on february   and as a result  there is limited information upon which to assess our ability to operate successfully the acquired assets 
accordingly  there is little operating history upon which to judge our business strategy  our management team or our current operations 
we have a history of losses and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future 
since we entered the oil and gas business in april  through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss from operations of million 
if we fail to generate profits from our operations  we will not be able to sustain our business 
we may never report profitable operations or generate sufficient revenue to maintain our company as a going concern 
the acquisition and integration of the triad operating interests and other assets may divert management from other important business activities 
this diversion  together with other difficulties in integrating triad s business and properties  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the difficulties and demands of integrating triad s assets and businesses into our company may divert management attention from other important business activities 
in addition to entering into new business activities  as a result of the triad acquisition  we now operate in new geographic markets and are subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements 
compliance with such regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management  cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non compliance with such additional legal requirements 
the demands of integrating an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements 
prior to the triad acquisition  we had employees  including our nine officers 
as a result of the triad acquisition the company and its affiliates  including triad hunter llc  had approximately total employees as of march  despite this increase in employment  we expect that we will continue to require the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  including reservoir engineering  land  legal  environmental and tax services 
we will also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation  evaluation and prospect leasing 
our dependence on third party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks  including but not limited to the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed  and the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects 
if we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties  our results of operations and stock price will be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
our operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons does not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
additionally  we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
the exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
such regulation includes requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations 
other activities subject to regulation are the location and spacing of wells  the unitization and pooling of properties  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used or other wastes generated in connection with our drilling operations  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  and the valuation and payment of royalties 
under these laws  we could be subject to claims for personal injury or property damages  including natural resource damages  which may result from the impact of our operations 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs of compliance 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our drilling operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process  which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations 
for example  we are often required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of natural gas or oil may have on the environment 
further  the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits we need may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably 
our operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or injunctive relief 
under existing environmental laws and regulations  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations  or our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance  and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional oil and natural gas wells in shale formations 
this process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate production 
sponsors of two companion bills  which are currently pending in the house energy and commerce committee and the senate committee on environment and public works committee have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
the proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  this legislation  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens 
the adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete new wells in shale formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls that we produce 
a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives have been introduced in the united states that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the senate may act on climate change legislation  how any bill passed by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  or how federal legislation may be reconciled with state and regional requirements  any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls that we produce 
in  the us supreme court held in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa that greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on december   the us environmental protection agency  or epa  officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in late september  the epa also proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect demand for our products and services  which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress and related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the us congress is currently considering legislation to increase the regulatory oversight of the over the counter derivatives markets in order to promote more transparency in those markets  and impose restrictions on certain derivatives transactions  which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
acesa contains provisions that would prohibit private energy commodity derivative and hedging transactions 
acesa would expand the power of the commodity futures trading commission cftc to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities  including oil and natural gas  and to mandate clearance of such derivative contracts through registered derivative clearing organizations 
under acesa  the cftc s expanded authority over energy derivatives would terminate upon the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform 
the chairman of the cftc has announced that the cftc intends to conduct hearings to determine whether to set limits on trading and positions in commodities with finite supply  particularly energy commodities  such as crude oil  natural gas and other energy products 
the cftc also is evaluating whether position limits should be applied consistently across all markets and participants 
in addition  the treasury department recently has indicated that it intends to propose legislation to subject all otc derivative dealers and all other major otc derivative market participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including by imposing conservative capital and margin requirements and strong business conduct standards 
derivative contracts that are not cleared through central clearinghouses and exchanges may be subject to substantially higher capital and margin requirements 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may act on derivatives legislation or how any climate change bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any new laws or regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to hedge and otherwise manage our financial risks related to swings in oil and gas commodity prices 
any legislative changes may impose additional restrictions on our trading and commodity positions  and could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of our hedging activity 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  exploiting mineral leases  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital

the provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under delaware law  and the concentrated ownership of our common stock by our chairman and other executive officers  could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 

table of contents because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our business 
our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors  including our business  financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and investment opportunities 
in addition  our senior credit facility limits the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders 
accordingly  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment  which may not occur 
we are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders 
any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends  liquidation rights  or voting rights 
if we issue preferred stock  it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our assets are subject to liquidation preferences in favor of the holders of our series b and series c preferred stock  which will impact the rights of holders of our common stock if we liquidate 
on december   we issued and sold  shares of our series c preferred stock 
we have also issued and sold additional shares of series c preferred stock pursuant to the at the market sales agreement relating to the series c preferred 
pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to such at the market sales of series c preferred stock  filed january   we may sell an additional  of series c preferred stock pursuant to such at the market sales agreement 
under the certificate of designations of the series c preferred stock  holders of the series c preferred stock are entitled to receive the repayment of their original investment  together with any accrued but unpaid dividends  before any payment is made to holders of our common stock 
the  shares of series b preferred stock issued as partial consideration for the triad acquisition have an aggregate liquidation preference of million  which pursuant to the certificate of designations for the series b preferred stock  must be paid  together with any accrued but unpaid dividends  before any payment is made to holders of junior securities  including holders of common stock 
in addition to the ongoing at the market offerings of shares of our common stock  our series c preferred stock described above  and the series b preferred stock described above  we may also seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities  preferred stock or other securities  and the holders of such securities may also have rights and preferences that are effectively senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
the holders of our common stock might therefore receive nothing in liquidation  or receive much less than they would if there were no series b  series c or other preferred stock or other senior securities outstanding 
our outstanding warrants which are exercisable into our common stock  may be exercised  which would dilute our existing common stockholders 
we have outstanding  warrants that have a final maturity of exercisable into common stock of magnum hunter 
any such exercise will be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock and securities convertible into  or exchangeable for  shares of our common stock in the public markets and the issuance of shares of common stock and securities convertible into  or exchangeable for  shares of our common stock in future acquisitions 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or by other parties in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

table of contents item properties properties appalachian basin marcellus shale with the completion of the acquisition of triad in february of  as of march   the company held approximately  net acres in the appalachian basin including approximately  net acres overlying the marcellus shale 
at year end  proved reserves from our appalachian basin area of operations on an sec basis were mmboe  consisting of oil and an estimated were classified as proved developed producing  with a pv of million 
using nymex strip prices  our proved reserves were mmboe and our pv was million 
we operate  wells and exited with a production rate of approximately boepd 
the appalachian basin includes the states of west virginia  ohio  kentucky  pennsylvania  maryland  new york  virginia  and tennessee and is considered the most mature oil and gas producing region in the united states 
because the appalachian basin is located near the energy consuming regions of the mid atlantic and northeastern united states  appalachian producers have historically sold their natural gas at a premium to the benchmark price for natural gas on the nymex 
historically  producers in the appalachian basin developed oil and natural gas from upper devonian age shallow sandstones with low permeability  which are prevalent in the region 
traditional shallow wells in the appalachian basin generally produce little or no water  contributing to a low cost of operation 
in addition  most wells produce dry natural gas  which does not require processing 
however  times have changed for the appalachian basin 
in recent years  the application of lateral well drilling and completion technology has lead to the development of the marcellus shale  transforming the appalachian basin into one of the country s premier economic shale gas reserves 
the productive limits of the marcellus shale cover a large area within new york  pennsylvania  ohio and west virginia 
this devonian age shale is a black  organic rich shale deposit productive at depths between  and  feet and ranges in thickness from to over feet 
it is considered the largest natural gas field in the country 
marcellus gas is best produced from hydraulically fractured horizontal wellbores 
these horizontal laterals exceed  feet in length  and typically involve multistage fracturing completions 
the company s marcellus acreage covers pleasants  tyler and ritchie counties within west virginia 
as of march  the company operates vertical marcellus wells defining the potential within our existing acreage 
the company s mineral lease acreage covers pleasants  tyler  ritchie  calhoun  clay  roane  wayne  wirt  wood  and lewis counties in west virginia  leigh  elliott and morgan counties in kentucky and morgan  noble and washington counties in ohio 
as of march   we had over  net acres in the appalachian basin including approximately  net acres in the marcellus shale 
as of march   approximately of our leases are held by production 
our shallow production comes from the berea  macksburg sand  devonian shale and the clinton medina sands and we also believe that our acreage may also have the possibility of producing from the trenton black river and huron formations 
the huron formation has also benefited from lateral well drilling technology 
in addition to our marcellus shale acreage  we also have significant enhanced waterflood oil recovery operations in calhoun  clay and roane counties in west virginia including our granny s creek field  richardson unit and tariff unit 
in  we plan to expand our marcellus program  drilling a minimum of two horizontal wells from our inventory of over identified horizontal drilling locations at a cost of approximately million 
north dakota williston basin madison group bakken shale at december   the company owned an approximately average working interest in fields located in the williston basin in north dakota comprising wells and approximately  gross acres approximately of which is held by production located in burke  renville  ward  bottineau and mchenry counties in north dakota 
as of december   our proved reserves on an sec basis were an estimated mmboe with a pv of million with approximately and of our reserves and production  respectively  consisting of oil 
as of december   on a nymex strip basis  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv of million 
at december   we had a production exit rate of approximately boepd from our north dakota properties 
the williston basin is spread across north dakota  montana and parts of southern canada with the united states portion of the basin encompassing approximately  square miles 
the basin produces oil and gas from numerous producing horizons including the madison  bakken  three forks sanish and red river formations 

table of contents the bakken formation is a devonian age shale found within the williston basin 
the bakken shale is estimated to contain up to billion barrels of recoverable crude oil according to a report issued by the united state geological survey usgs in april  making it the largest continuous crude oil accumulation ever assessed by the usgs 
generally the bakken formation underlies portions of north dakota and montana and is generally found at vertical depths of  to  feet 
below the lower bakken shale lies the three forks sanish formation  and the three forks shale has also proven to contain reservoir rock 
the three forks sanish typically consists of interbedded dolomites and shale with local development of a discontinuous sandy member at the top  known as the sanish sand 
crude oil production from the bakken shale and three forks sanish reservoirs is made possible through the combination of advanced horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation technology 
combining these two technologies to produce crude oil from the bakken formation began to evolve around year horizontal wells in these formations are typically drilled on  acre or  acre spacing with horizontal laterals extending  to  feet into the reservoir 
fracture stimulation techniques vary but most commonly utilize multi stage mechanically diverted stimulations using un cemented liners and packers 
eagle operating is the current operator of our williston basin properties 
re pressurization efforts commenced in november of  which have resulted in the ability to begin secondary recovery efforts through conventional and horizontal drilling activities in seven of the producing fields 
we have identified approximately horizontal drilling locations 
we drilled three horizontal wells in the fourth quarter of with a combined initial production rate of approximately boe per day gross 
these wells cost approximately million gross per well and have estimated average of approximately  boe eur gross per well 
south texas eagle ford shale as of march   we had approximately  net acres  gross primarily targeting the eagle ford shale 
at year end  on an sec basis  the company had mboe of proved reserves and pv of million 
using nymex strip pricing  we had proved reserves of mboe with a pv of million 
the eagle ford shale is a cretaceous aged shale ranging in thickness of less than feet to over feet 
the eagle ford shale is present within the subsurface along the entire gulf coast of texas and is productive within the majority of the trend  producing from the more brittle calcareous or dolomitic shale sections 
the eagle ford shale produces from depths that range from approximately  feet to  feet deep 
to date  the eagle ford shale produces in the texas counties of atascosa  brazos  burleson  dewitt  dimmit  gonzales  karnes  la salle  lee  live oak  maverick  mcmullen and webb  spanning approximately miles of the texas gulf coast and is becoming one of newest emerging successful shale reserves in the country 
the company has focused in the up dip oil trend of the eagle ford shale  feet to  feet to provide better economics metrics and commodity stability 
as of march   magnum hunter resources had over  gross acres leased in the eagle ford shale within the up dip oil trend in atascosa  gonzales  lee and fayette counties  texas 
at march   we controlled approximately  net acres of eagle ford shale and operate all of our eagle ford shale properties 
we have identified approximately horizontal eagle ford shale drilling locations 
working interest varies from in lee and fayette counties  texas to in gonzales and atascosa counties  texas 
in february  as part of the company s ongoing evaluation of the eagle ford shale  we fraced and tested a vertical eagle ford shale well  the barbara ann unit  in lee county  texas 
we believe that frac stimulation is the most important element in the successful completion of these shale wells and understanding frac dynamics within these shales using existing vertical wells will allow us to better plan completions within our proposed horizontal wells 
our south texas acreage has conventional oil and natural gas potential derived from both the austin chalk and wilcox formations 
our eberstadt well  located in the south caesar field of bee county  texas  began flowing to sales on february  with a daily production rate of approximately  mcf  producing from a gross foot thick section of the middle wilcox formation 
we believe that at least two additional wilcox wells can be drilled offsetting the eberstadt we have budgeted an estimated million in capital expenditures for associated with leasing new acreage and the drilling of two horizontal wells  which are currently expected to commence in the second quarter of we are also exploring multiple joint venture opportunities with third parties in the eagle ford shale

our natural gas and crude oil reserves have been estimated as of december  by cawley  gillespie associates  inc cga  and degolyer macnaughton dm 
natural gas and crude oil reserves and the estimates of the present value of future net revenues therefrom  were determined based on prices and costs as of december  since january   we have not filed  nor were we required to file  any reports concerning our oil and gas reserves with any federal authority or agency 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of reserve quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 

table of contents proved reserves in december  the sec released its finalized rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule requires disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area  using the arithmetic month average beginning of the month price for the year  as opposed to using year end prices as was practiced in all previous years 
the rule also allows for the use of reliable technologies to estimate proved oil and gas reserves  contingent on demonstrated reliability in conclusions about reserve volumes 
under the new rules  companies are required to report on the independence and qualifications of its reserve preparer or auditor  and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit 
the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves based on the new sec rules as defined in rule a of regulation s x and item of regulation s k

risk factors our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves you should also read the notes following the table below and our consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended december  in conjunction with the following reserve estimates

estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic impact that may result from our financial derivative activities 
these calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry 
the reserve information shown is estimated 
the certainty of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data  the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the estimates of reserves  future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions  and are inherently imprecise 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates 
we converted crude oil and ngls to mcf equivalent at a ratio of one barrel to six mcfe 
represents the present value  discounted at per annum pv  of estimated future cash flows before income tax of our estimated proved reserves 
the estimated future cash flows set forth above were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on prevailing economic conditions 
the estimated future production is priced based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  using per bbl and per mmbtu and adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies

marcellus infrastructure assets the triad acquisition brought important infrastructure assets for the effective development of the marcellus shale unconventional resource 
with increased drilling activity in the region  relying on third party oilfield service providers and pipeline operators can be costly 
we feel that control of key oil field services allows us to manage the timing and costs of drilling and production 
furthermore  we believe that access to a pipeline system is vital to flow natural gas to sales  often being a deciding factor on drilling and production decisions 
the summary below provides a brief overview of such services we operate and control  which mitigate certain risks associated with development of the marcellus shale 
additionally  we anticipate these assets will generate an attractive revenue stream as we actively market them to third party producers in the appalachian basin 
eureka hunter pipeline the eureka hunter pipeline consists of approximately miles of pipeline  gathering and rights of way located in northern west virginia  in the marcellus shale 
specifically  the existing pipeline system runs through pleasants  tyler  ritchie  wetzel  marion  harrison  doddridge  lewis and monongalia counties 
we are currently reviewing completion and expansion opportunities for the pipeline and we believe that the system can be expanded to up to mmcf d of throughput capacity 
following our anticipated expansion  we expect to have sufficient capacity to transport significant quantities of company produced natural gas from our marcellus shale development program  as well as third party gas 
we have budgeted million for the completion of the first miles of the pipeline project and anticipate completion in the third quarter of 
table of contents drilling rigs and oilfield service equipment as part of the triad acquisition in february of  we acquired drilling rigs and oilfield service equipment 
our oilfield service equipment primarily consists of three drilling rigs  a workover rig and heavy machinery which are operated for us and third parties by our wholly owned subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  llc 
we anticipate using our rigs to drill the vertical portion of our marcellus shale wells and then switching to larger rigs for the horizontal sections 
this flexibility is expected to reduce the overall drilling costs  as well as improve the timing of drilling activity 
as of march   two of our rigs are under a multi well drilling contract to a large producer in the area 
salt water disposal facility typically  marcellus shale wells produce significant amounts of water that  in most cases  requires disposal 
producers often remove the water in trucks for proper disposal in approved facilities 
while this method has been the only option to many producers in the appalachian basin  it adds a significant operating burden and increases costs 
we own and operate salt water disposal facilities with the current capacity of approximately  barrels of water per day 
in addition to benefiting from our own disposal facilities  we market our disposal capabilities to third party operators 
in  we anticipate disposal capacity will increase to over  barrels of water per day  following a  planned capital improvement 
recent sec rule making activity in december  the sec announced that it had approved revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements 
the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 
disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserve guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction 
we adopted the rules effective december   as required by the sec 

table of contents effect of adoption 
application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices at december  for both oil and gas than would have resulted under the previous rules 
use of new month average pricing rules at december  resulted in proved reserves of approximately mmboe 
use of the old year end prices rules would have resulted in proved reserves of approximately mmboe at december  therefore  the total impact of the new price methodology rules resulted in negative reserves revisions of mmboe 
proved undeveloped reserves pud s as of december   our proved undeveloped reserves totaled mmboe of crude oil  mmboe of ngls and bcf of natural gas  for a total of mmboe 
changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to successful drilling of pud locations in west texas successful drilling of pud locations in the mohall madison unit in north dakota and the re drill of a probable undeveloped location in the east flaxton madison unit in north dakota

the in this case is the working interest the operator owns 
this operator may assign his working interest to another operator subject to a retained overriding royalty 
this would then result in a basic royalty of  an overriding royalty of and a working interest of overriding royalty interest owners have no obligation or responsibility for developing and operating the property

pv uses year end prices for and prior years and the arithmetic month average beginning of the month price for and subsequent years 
production 
natural resources  such as oil or gas  taken out of the ground 
proved oil and gas reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
i the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes a the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and 
table of contents b adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
ii in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons lkh as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
iii where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
iv reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based  and b the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
v existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
proved developed oil and gas reserves 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves he attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
probable reserves 
probable reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered than proved reserves but more certain to be recovered than possible reserves 
it is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves p 
in this context  when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a percent probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the p estimate 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
when deterministic methods are used  it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain  even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves 
possible reserves 
possible reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggest are less likely to be recoverable than probable reserves 
the total quantities ultimately recovered from the project have a low probability to exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves p  which is equivalent to the high estimate scenario 
in this context  when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a percent probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the p estimate 

table of contents possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves 
when deterministic methods are used  the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain 
frequently  this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project 
possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves 
possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore  and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
where direct observation has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology 
portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations 
productive well 
a well that is found to be capable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well 
project 
a targeted development area where it is probable that commercial gas can be produced from new wells 
prospect 
a specific geographic area which  based on supporting geological  geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs  is deemed to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons 
proved developed producing reserves 
reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable from known reservoirs under current economic and operating conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
recompletion 
the process of re entering an existing well bore that is either producing or not producing and completing new reservoirs in an attempt to establish or increase existing production 
reserves 
oil  natural gas and gas liquids thought to be accumulated in known reservoirs 
reservoir 
a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible nature gas and or oil that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs 
secondary recovery 
a recovery process that uses mechanisms other than the natural pressure of the reservoir  such as gas injection or water flooding  to produce residual oil and natural gas remaining after the primary recovery phase 
shut in 
a well that has been capped having the valves locked shut for an undetermined amount of time 
this could be for additional testing  could be to wait for pipeline or processing facility  or could be for a number of other reasons 

table of contents standardized measure 
the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development  abandonment  production and income tax expenses  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate pv standardized measure differs from pv because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes 
successful 
a well is determined to be successful if it is producing oil or natural gas  or awaiting hookup  but not abandoned or plugged 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
water flood 
a method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil and enhance hydrocarbon recovery 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations

south texas eagle ford shale at year end  we had approximately  gross acres approximately  net primarily targeting the eagle ford shale 
we exited producing approximately bbls per day 
we have budgeted an estimated million in capital expenditures for associated with leasing new acreage and the drilling of two horizontal wells scheduled to commence in the second quarter of we are also exploring multiple joint venture opportunities to develop and expand our eagle ford acreage 
in february  as part of the company s ongoing evaluation of the eagle ford shale  we frac d and tested a vertical eagle ford shale well  the barbara ann unit  in lee county  texas 
we believe that frac stimulation is the most important element in the successful completion of these shale wells and understanding the frac dynamics within these shales using vertical wells will allow us to better plan completion within our horizontal laterals 
in addition to the eagle ford shale position  our south texas acreage has conventional oil and natural gas potential derived from both the austin chalk and wilcox formations 
our eberstadt well  located in the south caesar field of bee county  texas  began flowing to sales on february  with a daily production rate of approximately  mcf  producing from a gross foot thick section of the middle wilcox formation 
we believe that at least two additional wilcox wells can be drilled offsetting the eberstadt west texas cinco terry we have a working interest in an exploratory prospect area in crockett county  texas with oil and natural gas potential from multiple horizons including the canyon producing depths of approximately  feet to  feet and ellenburger sands producing depths of approximately  feet to  feet 
we exited producing approximately bbls per day of oil equivalent 
cinco terry is operated by approach resources  inc and consists of approximately  gross acres  net 
in  we successfully drilled and completed gross wells for total capital cost of million to the company 
we have identified approximately additional drilling locations 
in  capital expenditures will be approximately million 
other properties south louisiana east chalkley located in cameron parish  louisiana  this developmental project is an exploitation of bypassed oil reserves remaining in a natural gas field located at depths between  feet and  feet 
the unit consists of approximately gross acres 
on october   we acquired centurion exploration company llc s ownership interest east chalkley for million 
subsequently  on october   we divested a portion of our ownership interest for  following the acquisition of additional ownership interest and subsequent partial divestiture  we now operate east chalkley  own a working interest and receive a net revenue interest 
during  we added a salt water disposal well to reduce operating costs and electrification to the facilities 
we estimate the future potential of the project to include three producing wells and three injection wells 
currently we have two wells producing at a rate of approximately gross bbls of oil per day 
currently  we do not plan to allocate capital to this project in 
table of contents east texas surprise the surprise project is located in nacogdoches county  texas with natural gas potential from multiple horizons including james lime  pettit  travis peak  expanded bossier  cotton valley  and haynesville shale 
the prospect is operated by goodrich petroleum corporation 
the prospect area consists of approximately  gross net acres 
we have a working interest in the prospect and a net revenue interest of 
currently  we do not plan to allocate capital to this project in other in addition to our unconventional and other conventional properties  we have approximately  gross  net undeveloped acres in the new mexico  kentucky and utah 
currently  we do not plan to allocate capital to these areas in furthermore  in  we allowed our acreage positions in allen parish  louisiana and floyd and motley counties  texas to expire  as they were not central to our strategy 
marcellus infrastructure assets the triad acquisition in february  brought important infrastructure assets for the effective development of the unconventional resource 
with increased drilling activity in the region  relying on third party oilfield service providers and pipeline operators can be costly 
we feel that control of key oil field services allows us to better manage the timing and costs of drilling and production 
furthermore  we believe that access to a pipeline system is vital to flow natural gas to sales  often being a deciding factor on drilling and production decisions 
the summary below provides a brief overview of such services we operate and control  which mitigate certain risks associated with development of the marcellus shale 
additionally  we anticipate these assets will generate an attractive revenue stream as we actively market them to third party producers in the appalachian basin 
eureka hunter pipeline the eureka hunter pipeline consists of approximately miles of pipeline  gathering and rights of way located in northern west virginia  in what we believe to be the heart of the marcellus shale development for this region 
specifically  the pipeline system runs through pleasants  tyler  ritchie  wetzel  marion  harrison  doddridge  lewis and monongalia counties 
we are currently reviewing completion and expansion opportunities and we believe that the system can be expanded up to mmcf d of throughput capacity 
following our anticipated expansion  we expect to have sufficient capacity to transport significant quantities of natural gas from our marcellus shale development  as well as third party gas 
we have budgeted million for the completion of the first phase of the pipeline project and anticipate completion in the third quarter of drilling rigs and oilfield service equipment our oilfield service equipment primarily consists of three drilling rigs  a workover rig and heavy machinery which are operated for us and third parties by our wholly owned subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  llc 
we anticipate using our rigs to drill the vertical portion of our marcellus shale wells and then switching to larger rigs for the horizontal sections 
this flexibility is expected to reduce the overall drilling costs  as well as improve the timing of drilling activity 
currently  two of our rigs are under a multi well contract to a large producer in the area 
salt water disposal facility typically  marcellus shale wells produce significant amounts of water that  in most cases  requires disposal 
producers often remove the water in trucks for proper disposal in approved facilities 
while this method has been the only option to many producers in the appalachian basin  it adds a significant operating burden and increases costs 
we own and operate two commercial salt water disposal facilities with the current capacity for over  barrels of water per day 
in addition to benefiting from our own disposal facilities  we market our disposal capabilities to third party operators 
in  we anticipate disposal capacity will increase to over  barrels of water per day  following a thousand planned expansion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under us gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
proved reserves on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  approving revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the new reserve rules are effective for our financial statements for the year ended december  and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the most significant revisions to the reporting requirements include commodity prices 
economic producibility of reserves is now based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the month period prior to fiscal year end  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped for undrilled areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well if there is reasonable certainty that the quantities will be recovered  reliable technology 
the rules now permit the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  unproved reserves 
probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis  preparation of reserves estimates 
disclosure is required regarding the internal controls used to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing reserves estimates  and third party reports 
we are now required to file the report of any third party used to prepare or audit our reserve estimates 
in addition  in january  fasb issued accounting standards update  or the update   oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves estimation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
for the year ended december   we engaged cawley  gillespie associates  inc and degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with certain of our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the recent revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
we adopted these revisions effective december  
table of contents estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for natural gas  oil and ngls in accordance with new reserve rules 
the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices for natural gas  oil and ngls than would have resulted under the previous reporting requirements 
under the new reserve rules  our estimated proved reserves increased by  mboe 
under the previous reserve rules  our estimated total proved reserves of natural gas  oil and ngls would have increased by  mboe 
therefore  the effect of the new reserve rules was a negative revision of mboe 
changes in commodity prices and operation costs may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
under previous reserve rules year end spot prices for natural gas  oil and ngls  our depletion expense would have decreased by approximately thousand

derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in gain loss on derivative contracts on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  and we recorded a realized loss from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  realized gains and losses result from actual cash settlements received or paid under the derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations

table of contents asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
our liability for asset retirement obligations was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation our stock incentive plan allows grants of stock and options to employees and outside directors 
granting of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
in and  we recognized approximately million and million in non cash stock compensation  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
valuation of property and equipment the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that the company s long lived assets  including its oil and gas properties  be assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred 
an impairment charge to current operations is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value 
any such impairment is recognized based on the differences in the carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
the guidance provides for future revenue from the company s oil and gas production to be estimated based upon prices at which management reasonably estimates such products will be sold 
these estimates of future product prices may differ from current market prices of oil and gas 
any downward revisions to management s estimates of future production or product prices could result in an impairment of the company s oil and gas properties in subsequent periods 
the long lived assets of the company which are subject to evaluation consist primarily of oil and gas properties 
due to the regularly scheduled impairment reviews by management  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge against earnings of approximately  and million in and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil  natural gas  natural gas liquids and petroleum products  and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs  either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry 
revenues from the production of natural gas and crude oil properties  in which we have an interest with other producers  are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period 
any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes  based on our net working interest  which are deemed to be non recoverable through remaining production  are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management 
these reevaluations are based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  successfully settled issues under audit  expirations due to statutes  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 
we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense  and if applicable  penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are anticipated to be due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

in june  the fasb issued guidance to evaluate whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock under asc  derivatives and hedging 
the guidance requires entities to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock in order to determine if the instrument should be accounted for as a derivative under the scope of asc this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted asc beginning january   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission published a final rule  modernization of the oil and gas reporting requirements 
the new rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the use of average prices will affect future impairment and depletion calculations 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure  to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirement of the sec final rule with the asc the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  our adoption of this final rule for this annual report dated december  affected our oil and gas disclosures and resulted in  additional depletion expense in the fourth quarter

table of contents in may  the fasb issued guidance related to subsequent events under asc  subsequent events 
this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management or a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
it requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  we adopted asc beginning june  and have included the required disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
see note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
which amends asc  generally accepted accounting principles 
this guidance states that the asc will become the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
once effective  the codification s content will carry the same level of authority 
thus  the us gaap hierarchy will be modified to include only two levels of us gaap authoritative and non authoritative 
this is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted asc as of september  and thus have incorporated the new codification citations in place of the corresponding references to legacy accounting pronouncements 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure the fair value using one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability or similar liabilities when traded as an asset  which would be considered a level input  or another valuation technique that is consistent with asc this update is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
thus  we adopted this guidance as of september   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december  and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth summary information regarding natural gas  oil and ngl revenues  production  average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the last two years

production increased by mboe to mboe for the year ended december  from mboe for the year ended december   or 
production for on a boe basis was oil and ngls and natural gas compared to oil and ngls and natural gas for our average daily production on a boe basis was boe per day during compared to boe per day for the year 
the increase in production in compared to is primarily attributable to the effect of development expenditures 
we expect production to increase in due to our acquisition of triad which closed in february  and our continuing development efforts in our other fields 
oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales decreased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in oil and gas sales principally resulted from sharp decreases in the prices we received for our oil  natural gas and ngl production 
the average price we received for our production decreased from per boe to per boe  or a decrease 
of the million decrease in revenues  approximately million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices  offset by million in revenues attributable to the increase in production volumes from mboe in to mboe in the prices we receive for our products are generally tied to commodity index prices 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts in an attempt to offset some of the variability in prices 
see the discussion of commodity derivative activities below 

table of contents other income 
other income for the year ended december  included million in a liquidating damage penalty assessed against an operating partner 
other income for the year ended december  included a million gain from the sale of our interest in the hall houston exploration ii partnership and million of liquidated damage penalty assessed against an operating partner 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  decreased  or  for the year ended december  to million per boe from million per boe for the year ended december  the decrease in the per boe cost is due to our increased overall production and lower costs overall and per boe produced in our north dakota operations  where we benefited from lower power and service costs 
we expect this trend to continue in our north dakota fields where fixed costs are a relatively high percentage of total loe and where we have seen response to our unitization and secondary recovery efforts 
severance taxes and marketing 
our severance taxes decreased  or  for the year ended december  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in production taxes was a function of the decrease in oil and gas sales between and marketing expenses increased  or  for the year ended december  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase in marketing costs was a function of the necessity to increase compression capacity to maintain low gas pressure in several of our fields in severance taxes and marketing amounted to approximately and of oil and gas sales for december  and  respectively 
exploration 
we recorded million of exploration expense for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  exploration expense in the period resulted primarily from dry hole costs in the boomerang and hound dog fields  d seismic acquired across our cinco terry field  the expiration of leases in our leblanc prospect  and other lease extensions 
exploration expense for the period resulted from dry hole costs in our north dakota fields and the write off of costs in our south san arroyo and whitewater prospects 
due to additional d expenses from the seismic acquisition across cinco terry  lease renewals and expirations  and potential exploration costs in northern new mexico and eagle ford shale in texas  we expect exploration expense to increase in impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review for impairment our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved and unproved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets  we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of  and million in and  respectively 
the impairment resulted from a write off of  of unproved acreage costs in the boomerang and leblanc prospect areas 
in  we took an impairment write down of million on the east flaxton unit in north dakota due to reduced expected future cash flows for the unit 
depletion  depreciation and accretion 
our depletion  depreciation and accretion expense  or dd a  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our dd a per boe decreased by  or  to per boe for the year ended december   compared to per boe for the year ended december  the decrease in dd a was primarily attributable to the increase in proved developed producing reserves and total proved reserves in north dakota of and  respectively  at december  compared to december   due to an upward trend in production during the third and fourth quarters of as a response to our new drilling  unitization and secondary recovery efforts  and lower loe costs per boe produced 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million  or  to million per boe for the year ended december  from million per boe for the year ended december  our g a for included higher share based compensation  as well as higher salaries  related employee benefit costs attributable to an increase in staff from the prior year period  higher rent and office costs  and consulting and professional services  all due to the increased level of activity which began in the second quarter of and is continuing 
non cash g a expenses totaled million and million for the and periods  respectively  and represent noncash stock compensation granted our employees 
also included in g a in the period are acquisition related costs of million which were for legal  consulting and other costs related to the acquisition of sharon resources  inc on september  and the acquisition of the triad companied which closed on february  these costs were expensed due to the requirements of asc which states that acquisition costs must be expensed rather than capitalized as part of the cost of the asset being acquired for years beginning in additional acquisition related expenses related to the triad acquisition were incurred in we expect overall g a costs to increase in due to the acquisition of triad 
interest expense  net 
our interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was substantially the result of our higher average debt level during and our write off of deferred finance costs related to the revolving credit borrowing and term loan paid off on november   in connection with the closing of our new senior revolving credit facility 

table of contents loss on debt extinguishment 
we recorded a loss from debt extinguishment of million for the year ended december   due to the payoff of a credit facility with a different previous lender 
commodity derivative activities 
realized gains and losses from our commodity derivative activity decreased our earnings by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized gains and losses are derived from the relative movement of oil and gas prices on the products we sell in relation to the range of prices in our derivative contracts for the respective years 
the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for and the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was million for as commodity prices increase  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases  and vice versa 
as commodity prices decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions increases 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record all changes in realized and unrealized gains and losses on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
our gain or loss from realized and unrealized derivative contracts was a loss of million and a gain of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss attributable to non controlling interest 
net loss from non controlling interest was  in versus million in this represents of the loss incurred by our subsidiary  prc williston 
we record a non controlling interest in the results of operations of this subsidiary because we are contractually obligated to make distributions to the holders of this interest whenever we make distributions to ourselves from the subsidiary company 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on our series c preferred stock were  in versus none in the series c preferred stock has a stated value of million  carries a cumulative dividend rate of per annum  and was issued on december  in  we recorded a dividend of million on our series a convertible preferred stock 
we redeemed all of our series a stock was redeemed on september  for million 
liquidity and capital resources we generally will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public and private equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from equity or debt financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available  or acceptable on our terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives 
prices for oil and gas are affected by national and international economic and political environments  national and global supply and demand for hydrocarbons  seasonal influences of weather and other factors beyond our control 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices  and significant declines in prices will cause a decrease in our production volumes and exploration and development expenditures 
cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas properties
