item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences  inc hgs is a commercially focused biopharmaceutical company advancing toward the market with three products in late stage development benlysta tm for systemic lupus erythematosus sle  zalbin tm for chronic hepatitis c  and raxibacumab for inhalation anthrax 
benlysta and zalbin continue to progress toward commercialization 
in july and november  we reported that benlysta successfully met its primary endpoints in two phase clinical trials in patients with systemic lupus 
we and glaxosmithkline gsk plan to submit marketing applications for benlysta in the united states and europe in the second quarter of in march  we reported that zalbin successfully met its primary endpoint in the second of two phase clinical trials in chronic hepatitis c 
hgs submitted a biologics license application bla for zalbin in the united states in november  and novartis submitted a marketing authorization application maa under the brand name joulferon in europe in december we received confirmation from the us food and drug administration fda in february that the bla submission was accepted for filing with a prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of october  in the first half of we achieved our first product sales and recognized million in product sales and manufacturing and development services revenue by delivering  doses of raxibacumab to the us strategic national stockpile sns 
in july  the us government usg exercised its option to purchase  additional doses to be delivered over a three year period 
we expect to receive a total of approximately million from the second order  including million in revenue recognized from our first delivery under the new award in the fourth quarter of in may  we submitted a bla to the fda for raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalation anthrax 
we received a complete response letter in november  and we continue to work closely with the fda to determine the additional steps necessary to obtain approval 
in addition to these products in our internal pipeline  we have substantial financial rights to two novel drugs that gsk has advanced to late stage development 
in december  gsk initiated the second phase clinical trial of darapladib  which was discovered by gsk based on our technology  to evaluate whether darapladib can reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke 
with more than  patients enrolled  the phase clinical program for darapladib is among the largest ever conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any cardiovascular medication 
in the first quarter of  we received a million milestone payment related to gsk s initiation of a phase program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of syncria albiglutide in the long term treatment of type diabetes mellitus 
we created syncria using our proprietary albumin fusion technology and licensed it to gsk in six phase trials of syncria are currently ongoing 
we also have several novel drugs in earlier stages of clinical development for the treatment of cancer  led by our trail receptor antibody mapatumumab and a small molecule antagonist of iap inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 
strategic partnerships are an important driver of our commercial success 
we have co development and commercialization agreements with prominent pharmaceutical companies for both of our lead products gsk for benlysta and novartis for zalbin 
raxibacumab is being developed under a contract with the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda of the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr  us department of health and human services hhs 
our strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies allow us to leverage our strengths and gain access to sales and marketing infrastructure  as well as complementary technologies 
some of these partnerships provide us with licensing or other fees  clinical development cost sharing  milestone payments and rights to royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
in some cases  we are entitled to certain commercialization  co promotion  revenue sharing and other product rights 
in the second half of  we received million in net proceeds from two public offerings of our common stock  bringing our cash and investments at december  to approximately billion 
overview continued during  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis 
under this agreement  novartis will co develop and co commercialize zalbin and share development costs  sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized in the us novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay us a royalty on these sales 
we received a million up front fee from novartis upon the execution of the agreement 
including this up front fee  we are entitled to payments aggregating up to million upon the successful attainment of certain milestones 
as of december   we have contractually earned and received payments aggregating million  including million received in we are recognizing these payments as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development period  estimated to end in the fall of in  gsk exercised its option to co develop and co commercialize benlysta 
in accordance with a co development and co commercialization agreement signed during  we and gsk will share phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized 
we received a million payment during as partial consideration for entering into this agreement with respect to benlysta and are recognizing this payment as revenue ratably over the development period  estimated to end in the fall of we expect that any significant revenue or income through at least may be limited to raxibacumab revenue  payments under collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  cost reimbursements from gsk and novartis  payments from the license of product rights  payments under manufacturing agreements  such as our agreement with hospira  inc  investment income and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements  and possibly initial sales of benlysta and or zalbin 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts and increased expenses relating to our commercialization efforts 
as a result  we expect to incur losses over at least the next two years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or any future agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical investments 
we account for investments in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including but not limited to the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent to hold the security until the market value recovers  which may be maturity 
we also evaluate whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized  or an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as non current marketable securities 
for investments carried at fair value  we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy as prescribed by fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
we evaluate the types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine the proper classification in the fair value hierarchy based on trading activity and the observability of market inputs 
we generally obtain a single quote or price per instrument from independent third parties to help us determine the fair value of securities in level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
inventory 
inventory costs incurred prior to receiving regulatory approval for a product are expensed 
inventory costs associated with raxibacumab produced subsequent to receiving the follow on order from the usg are capitalized using the first in  first out method 
leases 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
during  we entered into a year lease agreement with biomed realty trust  inc biomed for our traville facility 
we account for the traville lease with biomed as an operating lease 
during and as described further in note f  long term debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our large scale manufacturing lsm facility and headquarters land to biomed  and simultaneously agreed to lease such assets back over years 
we recorded the sale and leaseback of these assets as a financing transaction and accordingly recorded the allocated sale proceeds as outstanding debt on our balance sheet 
we account for lease payments under the related lease agreements as principal and interest payments on this debt 
impairments of long lived assets 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be sold are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
product sales 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
manufacturing and development services 
we have entered into agreements for manufacturing process development  clinical and commercial supply of certain biopharmaceutical products 
revenue under these agreements is recognized as services are performed or products delivered  depending on the nature of the work contracted  using a proportional performance method of accounting 
performance is assessed using output measures such as units of work performed to date as compared to total units of work contracted 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development collaborative agreements 
our revenue recognition policies for all non refundable up front license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
fasb asc topic provides guidance on when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued units of accounting according to fasb asc topic s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting  non refundable up front license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
if not deemed substantive  we would recognize such milestones as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and  the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone and any ongoing research and development or other services are priced at fair value 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
the up front license fee received in from novartis in connection with zalbin is being recognized ratably over an estimated four year clinical development period ending in to the extent we achieve the clinical development milestones set forth in the novartis agreement  the amounts received for these milestones will be recognized ratably over the remaining estimated clinical development period from the date of attainment 
our initial payment from gsk in connection with benlysta is being recognized ratably over the estimated four year clinical development period ending in our up front license fee with gsk in connection with syncria is being recognized ratably over the estimated eight year clinical development period ending in our other revenues from research and development collaborative agreements in  and have been recognized in full upon receipt  as we have met the criteria for recognition 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
estimates of the incurred to date but not yet received invoices must be made for clinical site and cro costs in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
reimbursement of research and development expenses received in connection with collaborative cost sharing agreements is recorded as a reduction of such expenses 
stock compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan the incentive plan under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the incentive plan also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted non vested or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
we account for share based awards to employees and non employee directors pursuant to fasb guidance that compensation cost resulting from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
exit accruals 
in  we exited certain facilities  including certain headquarters space wing c  which required us to make significant estimates in several areas including the realizable values of assets deemed redundant or excess and the ability to generate sublease income 
we recorded an initial liability of approximately million critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued in lease related costs with respect to our exit activities 
during the second quarter of  our wing c subtenant terminated its sublease  which resulted in a charge of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to resume production activities in wing c and reversed approximately million  representing the portion of the wing c exit reserve related to the production space 
as of december   the exit reserve  which is primarily for the non production space in wing c  is approximately million 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
in determining the effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local and foreign income taxes and our ability to use tax incentives 
we file income tax returns in us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions 
our income taxes have not been subject to examination by any tax jurisdictions since its inception 
accordingly  all our filed income tax returns are subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in raxibacumab product sales  million related to raxibacumab development services  million from contract manufacturing services and million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin 
revenue for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin and million recognized from gsk related to straight line recognition of an up front fee for benlysta 
revenue recognized from novartis increased in due to receipt of a million milestone which is being recognized over the remaining development period  estimated to end in the fall of cost of sales 
cost of sales includes both cost of product sales of million and cost of manufacturing and development services of million for the year ended december  no cost of sales were incurred in as we had no revenue from product sales or manufacturing and development services 
with respect to the initial order for raxibacumab  we incurred substantially all of the product and service costs prior to  and expensed these costs as incurred 
we incurred royalty costs associated with the initial order during  which are included in cost of product sales 
in addition  we have recorded as cost of product sales the expenses associated with manufacturing additional raxibacumab incurred prior to receiving the follow on order in july our manufacturing and development service costs include raxibacumab development service costs incurred in and costs associated with contract manufacturing services 
after approval of a product  inventoriable costs are capitalized into inventory and will be expensed as the inventory is sold 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk  respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk  respectively 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the conclusion of animal studies being conducted for raxibacumab in  and a million milestone payment made to aegera therapeutics  inc aegera in our research costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to decreased activity related to raxibacumab and zalbin  partially offset by increased activity related to contract manufacturing services 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to capitalizing raxibacumab production costs beginning in and decreased production of raxibacumab  zalbin and benlysta  partially offset by increased manufacturing services activities 
our manufacturing costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of anticipated cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under the commercial cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs in are expected to increase as we produce commercial product in anticipation of launch 
these costs are expensed as incurred until regulatory approval of the product is obtained 
our clinical development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the substantial completion of our zalbin phase clinical trials in late  completion of the first phase benlysta clinical trial and wind down of the second phase benlysta clinical trial during and decreased hgs etr clinical trial costs 
our clinical development costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased pre commercial launch activities  partially offset by decreased legal expenses associated with our patents 
general and administrative expenses in future periods may increase as the level of pre commercial launch activities rises 
facility related exit charges of million for the year ended december  relate to an adjustment to our exit reserve for wing c 
our wing c subtenant terminated its lease during  which resulted in an exit charge of million during the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we decided to resume production activities in most of wing c and accordingly  reversed million of the million charge  resulting in a net exit charge of million for the full year 
during  we did not incur any facility related exit charges 
see note k  facility related exit charges credits  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower yields in as compared to  partially offset by higher average investment balances 
investment income also includes realized net losses on our results of operations continued years ended december  and continued short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net gains of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  our average investment balance for will be higher than due to the proceeds from our two public offerings of common stock  however our overall yield on investments may be lower as those proceeds are invested in securities with lower interest rates than our maturing investments 
a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense includes non cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the adoption of fasb asc topic which requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the february repurchase of convertible subordinated debt due in and the gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  relates to the repurchase of convertible subordinated debt due in and with a face value of approximately million for an aggregate cost of approximately million plus accrued interest 
the gain on extinguishment of debt is net of write offs of related debt discount of million and deferred financing charges of million 
the gain on sale of long term equity investment for the year ended december  and of million and million respectively  relates to the sale of our investment in cogenesys  inc cogenesys 
we received initial proceeds in of million 
our cost basis in this investment was million  resulting in a gain of million 
the agreement between cogenesys and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva provided for an escrow of a portion of the purchase price 
we received the final payment for our equity investment during and recorded an additional gain of million 
other expense of million for the year ended december  primarily represents unrealized  non cash foreign currency translation losses related to our investment in aegera  which is denominated in canadian dollars 
other expense of million for the year ended december  was due to an other than temporary impairment of our investment in debt securities issued by lehman brothers holdings  inc lbhi 
during  lbhi experienced a significant deterioration in its credit worthiness and filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
income tax benefit 
income tax benefit of million represents a credit received in of million for and an accrued income tax benefit of million for we elected to accelerate recognition of research and development tax credits by electing out of bonus depreciation pursuant to regulations passed in net income loss 
we recorded net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the improvement to net income from a net loss is primarily due to activity including revenue from raxibacumab  gain on extinguishment of debt and reduced research and development expenses 
years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted primarily of revenue recognized from novartis of million for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin and million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for benlysta 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued the revenues consisted primarily of million in revenue recognized from novartis for the straight line recognition of up front license fees and milestones reached for zalbin and million from gsk related to straight line recognition of up front license fees for benylsta 
expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for include million paid to aegera in connection with a collaboration and license agreement 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk  respectively 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of million and million of costs reimbursed by novartis and gsk respectively 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to the million paid to aegera in in connection with our licensing and collaboration agreement and purchase price premium as compared to a million milestone paid to aegera in  partially offset by an increase in activities supporting new target development 
our research costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to less cost reimbursement under the zalbin program and greater activity in other projects for which we have no cost sharing provisions 
pharmaceutical sciences costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased production activities for raxibacumab and benlysta  partially offset by decreased activities for hgs etr and zalbin 
our manufacturing costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
our clinical development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to reduced phase zalbin clinical trial costs as the trials near completion  partially offset by increased phase trial costs related to benlysta 
our clinical development costs for the years ended december  and are net of million and million  respectively  of cost reimbursement from novartis and gsk under cost sharing provisions in our collaboration agreements 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased preparatory results of operations continued years ended december  and continued activities for commercialization 
general and administrative expenses include approximately million related to the settlement of certain patent proceedings  which were offset by a decrease in other legal expenses 
during  we did not incur any facility related exit charges 
facility related exit credits in related to the reversal of a liability and the recording of a gain aggregating million in connection with the purchase and sale of a small laboratory and office building 
see note k  facility related exit charges credits  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower average investment balances in as compared to investment income also includes realized net gains on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to net gains of million for the year ended december  the yield on our investments was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our gain on sale of long term equity investments for the year ended december  of million relates to the sale of our investment in cogenesys 
in  we completed the sale of assets of our cogenesys division and held a equity interest in cogenesys  a newly formed company 
in  cogenesys was acquired by teva 
we received initial proceeds of million 
our cost basis in this investment was million 
we received additional proceeds of approximately million in february related to this transaction 
see note d  collaborations and us government agreement  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other expense of million for the year ended december  was due to an other than temporary impairment of our investment in debt securities issued by lbhi 
during  lbhi experienced a significant deterioration in its credit worthiness and filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we determined that our investment in lbhi debt securities had incurred an other than temporary impairment 
see note c  investments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the decreased loss for compared to is primarily due to the gain on sale of our cogenesys investment of million  or per share  and increased revenues  partially offset by a decrease in investment income and a charge for impaired investments of million  or per share 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  compared to a working capital shortfall of million at december  the improvement in our working capital is primarily due to the cash provided by our two public offerings of common stock totaling approximately million and our raxibacumab revenue of million  net of million used in february to extinguish approximately million of our convertible subordinated debt  partially offset by our costs and expenses in we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our active product candidates 
we will also incur costs related to our pre commercial launch activities 
in the event our working capital needs exceed our available working capital  we can utilize our non current marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
in  the usg agreed to purchase  additional doses of raxibacumab for the sns  to be delivered over a three year period  which began in we expect to receive a total of approximately million from this order as deliveries are completed  million of which was recognized in liquidity and capital resources continued we may also receive payments under collaboration agreements  to the extent milestones are met  which would further improve our working capital position 
we continue to evaluate our working capital position on an ongoing basis 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
the deterioration of the credit markets during had a detrimental effect on our investment portfolio  but as of december  the gross unrealized losses on our available for sale securities have decreased to million from million as of december  the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we are completing our fourth phase trial and have several ongoing phase and phase trials and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the completion periods for our phase  phase  and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
some trials may take considerably longer to complete 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
our clinical development expenses are impacted by the clinical phase of our drug candidates 
our expenses increase as our drug candidates move to later phases of clinical development 
the status of our clinical projects is as follows clinical trial status as of december  product candidate indication zalbin hepatitis c phase phase phase benlysta systemic lupus erythematosus phase phase phase benlysta rheumatoid arthritis phase phase phase raxibacumab anthrax hgs cancer phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase includes only those candidates for which an investigational new drug application ind has been filed with the fda 
clinical trial status defined as when patients are being dosed 
phase results reported  bla filed in phase monthly dosing study underway 
results from two phase clinical trials reported  second of these two concluding in  pre bla activities underway 
initial phase trial completed  treatment ind ongoing and further development under review 
bla filed in  complete response letter received from fda  additional work ongoing 
ind filed in december with respect to hgs formerly aeg 
ongoing phase trial by national institutes of health  further development not anticipated 
we identify our drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we liquidity and capital resources continued may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we are advancing a number of drug candidates  including antibodies  an albumin fusion protein and a small molecule  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of a single drug candidate would increase 
we must receive regulatory clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  we entered into a collaboration agreement in with novartis to co develop and co commercialize zalbin 
under this agreement  we will co commercialize zalbin in the united states  and will share us commercialization costs and us profits equally 
novartis will be responsible for commercialization outside the us and will pay us a royalty on those sales 
we and novartis share clinical development costs 
including a non refundable up front license fee  we are entitled to payments aggregating approximately million upon successful attainment of certain milestones 
as of december   we have contractually earned and received milestones aggregating million  including million received in in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with gsk with respect to benlysta and received a payment of million 
we and gsk share phase and development costs  and will share sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized in accordance with the collaboration agreement 
during  we recorded approximately million of reimbursement from novartis and gsk with respect to our cost sharing agreements as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we are recognizing the up front fees and milestones received from novartis and gsk as revenue ratably over the estimated remaining development periods 
we have collaborators who have sole responsibility for product development 
for example  gsk is developing other products under separate agreements as part of our overall relationship with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds  payments received under the raxibacumab contract and other agreements and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities  the magnitude of our discovery and preclinical development programs and the level of our pre commercial launch activities 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
we may undertake financings and may repurchase or restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
during we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated debt due in and at a cost of approximately million plus accrued interest 
in august and december we completed public offerings of our common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources continued we have certain contractual obligations which may have a future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
our operating leases  along with our unconditional purchase obligations  are not recorded on our balance sheets 
debt associated with the sale and accompanying leaseback of our lsm facility to biomed in is recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and we have an option to purchase the traville facility in for million 
this is not reflected in the contractual obligations table below because we are not obligated to exercise this option 
our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period one year two to four to after total or less three years five years five years dollars in millions contractual obligations long term debt convertible notes long term lease commitment biomed operating leases unconditional purchase obligations raxibacumab milestones and royalties other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheets total contractual cash obligations contractual interest obligations related to our convertible subordinated notes included above total million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million are due in one year or less and two to three years  respectively 
contractual interest obligations related to biomed are included above and aggregate million as of december  contractual interest obligations of million  million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
includes traville headquarters operating lease with biomed with aggregate payments of million 
lease payments of million  million  million and million are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate to commitments for capital expenditures 
includes milestone payments and royalties associated with the delivery of raxibacumab to the us strategic national stockpile 
in the event we reach certain development milestones for zalbin  benlysta or raxibacumab such as successful completion of phase trials or regulatory approval  we would be obligated to make payments of up to million over the next five years 
in the event we reach certain development milestones related to hgs  we would be obligated to pay up to million 
our other products are in either phase or phase and would also obligate us to make certain milestone payments should they reach phase or regulatory approval 
these other payments could result in aggregate milestone payments of million 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of these products will reach these milestones  we have excluded these amounts and any royalty payments  except for those related to raxibacumab sales under the current order from the usg  from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see note f  long term debt and note g  commitments and other matters  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources continued as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately billion  excluding approximately billion of stock based compensation nols  which expire  if unused  through december  we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  through december  our unrestricted and restricted funds may be invested in us treasury securities  government agency obligations  high grade corporate debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  we entered into two long term leases with the maryland economic development corporation medco expiring january  for a small scale manufacturing facility aggregating  square feet and built to our specifications 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
the facility was financed primarily through a combination of bonds issued by medco medco bonds and loans issued to medco by certain state of maryland agencies 
we have no equity interest in medco 
rent is based upon medco s debt service obligations and annual base rent under the leases is currently approximately million 
the medco bonds are secured by letters of credit issued for the account of medco which were renewed in december we are required to have restricted investments of approximately million which serve as security for the medco letters of credit reimbursement obligation 
upon default or early lease termination  the medco bond indenture trustee can draw upon the letters of credit to pay the medco bonds as they are tendered 
in such an event  we could lose part or all of our restricted investments and could record a charge to earnings for a corresponding amount 
alternatively  we have an option through the end of the lease term to purchase this facility for an aggregate amount that declines from approximately million in to approximately million in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do  however  have certain aspects of our global clinical studies that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise securities  high grade debt having at least an a rating at time of purchase and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately nine months  decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change related to interest rates 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of billion  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any interest rate change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the yield on comparable one year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates may adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and may be replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk  we invest in securities with strong credit ratings and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments  auction rate securities  loans held for sale or mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime or alt a collateral  and we generally hold our investments in debt securities until maturity 
however  adverse changes in the credit markets relating to credit risks would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments 
during the year ended december   the gross unrealized losses in our portfolio decreased from million to million 
the majority of these unrealized losses related to our holdings of corporate debt securities 
at december   the fair value of our corporate debt securities was approximately million  or of our total investment portfolio of million 
the remaining securities in our portfolio are either us treasury and agency securities or government sponsored enterprise securities  which we believe are subject to less credit risk 
although there has been improvement in our gross unrealized losses  in the event there is further deterioration in the credit market  the fair value of our corporate debt securities could decline 
the facility leases we entered into during require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments of approximately million  or million if in the form of cash  as collateral for these facilities 
together with the requirement to maintain approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our small scale manufacturing facility leases  our overall level of restricted investments is currently required to be approximately million 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
our convertible subordinated notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  our interest expense on these notes is not affected by changes in interest rates 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe that is assisting in our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks to be immaterial to our operations as a whole 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences pacific pty ltd 
hgs pacific that is sponsoring some of our clinical trials in the asia pacific region 
we currently do not anticipate hgs pacific to have any operational activity and therefore we do not believe we will have any foreign currency fluctuation risks with respect to hgs pacific
