item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in thousands introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this report 
overview we  through our operating subsidiaries  are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented of total piano units sold and of total piano revenues in our boston piano line and many of our essex piano models are sourced from asia by single manufacturers 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could impact our business and operating results 
a breakdown of sales by our divisions and their geographic location can be found in note to the financial statements 
in  our piano sales had the following geographic breakdown based on customer location approximately in the united states  in europe  in japan  in china  and the remaining primarily in other asian countries 
for the year ended december   our piano segment sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for similar to  we expect a challenging year for our piano segment with respect to sales and gross profit 
we anticipate the domestic market will be as challenging as the major overseas markets 
we will continue to manage production levels so as not to build excess inventory and believe the headcount reductions made in will enable us to operate our facilities more efficiently 
we will continue to monitor and restrict expenses  as well as assist our dealers through the us credit crisis without undue risk to receivable collectibility 
we currently have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment  general attitudes toward music and the arts  and our ability to provide competitively priced products to our dealer network 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs  the remainder is to amateur or professional musicians or performing groups  including symphonies and orchestras 
in recent years we expanded our offerings of sourced products to include quality  competitively priced instruments that have our brand names and are built to our specifications 
our product offerings are tailored to the needs of traditional school music dealers who provide full service rental programs to beginning band students  as well as music retailers and e commerce dealers selling directly to end consumers from their stores or through the internet 
we believe our product offerings have helped us remain competitive at various price points and will continue to do so in the future 
in  beginner instruments accounted for approximately of band orchestral unit shipments and approximately of band instrument revenues  with intermediate and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in japan and canada 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for we expect margins to improve  although sales will remain somewhat challenging this year for our band division 
our dealers continue to be adversely impacted by the credit crisis and order only what they need and can readily sell 
we have reduced production of certain instruments so as not to build excess inventory  and continue to monitor order levels so we may build sufficient inventory to meet demand 
we made headcount reductions in and will continue to restrict expenses 
similar to the piano division  we are helping our dealers through the us credit crisis without undue risk to receivable collectibility 
we currently have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of consolidated sales in we record sales in euro  japanese yen  british pounds  and chinese renminbi 
in  we generated of our international sales through our piano segment 
foreign exchange rate changes reduced reported sales by approximately million in the current year 
although currency fluctuations affect international sales  they also affect cost of sales and related operating expenses 
consequently  they generally have not had a material impact on operating income 
we use financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes we are subject to us income taxes as well as tax in several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
some of these foreign jurisdictions have higher statutory rates than the united states 
in addition  certain of our operations are subject to both us and foreign taxes 
however  in such cases we receive a credit against our us taxes for foreign taxes paid equal to the percentage that such foreign income as adjusted for reallocated interest represents of the total income subject to us tax 
accordingly  our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the united states 
in  we were able to use over of the foreign tax credits generated during the year 
we recognized a benefit of million for the excess foreign tax credits generated 
there are million of foreign tax credits due to expire in the event they are not utilized in our federal return 
currently  we do not anticipate using these credits 
however  since they were fully reserved in a prior period  their expiration will have no impact on our effective rate 
should we be able to use these credits  it would beneficially impact our rate in our overall effective tax rate for was  which is comprised of relating to current period operations and relating to discrete items such as uncertain tax positions and settlements with taxing authorities 
in  we were able to use approximately of the foreign tax credits generated during the year 
we recognized a benefit of million for the excess foreign tax credits generated  net of reserves  which were recorded based on our recent historical foreign tax credit usage trends and anticipated ratios of foreign source income to domestic income in the future 
our rate was beneficially impacted by million in reduction of taxes  interest  and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions that were settled during the year 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate was in in  we recognized a benefit of approximately million due to the reduction in german tax rates and were able to use a majority  but not all  of our foreign tax credits 
we carried forward million of credits  and recognized the full benefit for the excess foreign tax credits generated 
however  our rate was adversely impacted by approximately million of taxes  penalties  and interest associated with uncertain tax positions 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate was in results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the years ended december  change net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization and impairment charges total operating expenses income from operations other income  net gain on extinguishment of debt net interest expense non operating expenses income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview the same economic conditions discussed above negatively impacted both the piano and band divisions revenue throughout piano division revenue was adversely affected by the current economic crisis as well as our dealers access to available financing 
piano margins continued to be negatively impacted by lower production volume at both of our manufacturing facilities 
band division sales decreased as a result of reduced demand  similar credit restrictions  and dealers tendency to only order products that can be resold quickly 
however  band margins improved due largely to lower cash discounts and sales program costs 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of lower gross profit  management has reduced headcount  lowered salaries  suspended or reduced benefits  and taken other cost saving measures throughout the company 
piano division results include the operations of our online music business  which recognized an impairment charge of million on its trademark assets due to a decline in estimated forecasted discounted cash flows as a result of the economic downturn 
no charge was taken against any other intangible assets and no other events or circumstances have occurred subsequent to our annual testing in july which would indicate impairment 
net sales net sales decreased million due to decreases in both the band and piano division revenues of 
band division revenues decreased million on a decrease in unit shipments 
this was mitigated by a shift from beginner level instruments towards higher priced intermediate and professional level instruments 
piano revenues  which included million of online music retail sales  deteriorated million in the current period 
domestically  steinway grand unit shipments dropped  while mid priced piano unit shipments decreased  resulting in million lower revenues 
overseas steinway grand unit shipments decreased and mid priced piano line shipments decreased  causing the million deterioration in sales 
this includes a million reduction in revenues attributable to foreign exchange 
we experienced reduced demand at both the wholesale and retail levels worldwide  although our mid priced piano lines have been less affected by the economic downturn 
gross profit gross profit fell million due to lower sales at both divisions and lower margins at the piano division 
the band division s gross margin increased slightly  from to during the period 
pension costs increased million due primarily to pension asset portfolio deterioration 
this was more than offset by reduced cash discounts and sales program costs  which were million higher in the year ago period 
the absence of severance costs associated with our facility rationalization project  which were million in the year ago period  and the shift in mix to certain higher margin accessories and brass instruments mitigated the unabsorbed overhead resulting from lower production 
piano segment gross profit dropped million during the period 
domestically  piano margins decreased from to as the factory produced fewer steinway grand pianos than in the year ago period in order to manage inventory levels 
this resulted in higher unabsorbed overhead and product costs  which adversely impacted the margin 
overseas margins went from to as our factory in germany also reduced production of steinway grands by compared to operating expenses operating expenses were million lower due to several factors 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million due to lower salaries  commissions  and bonuses  as well as decreased spending for trade shows and advertising 
due to reductions in headcount  wages  benefits  and outside services  general and administrative costs were million less than in facility rationalization and impairment charges facility rationalization and impairment charges decreased million 
we wrote off million of band division goodwill in the year ago period  whereas in the current period  impairment charges were limited to the million write down of trademarks associated with our online music business 
non operating expenses non operating expenses decreased million due to the extinguishment of million of our senior notes  which resulted in a million net gain  as compared to the million gain in other income  net increased million over the year ago period 
foreign exchange losses were million more than in the year ago period 
however  these expenses were more than offset by the shift from losses to gains on our supplemental executive retirement plan serp assets and increased net income from our steinway hall property 
net interest expense was million higher due to lower interest income on band division financed receivables 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the years ended december  change net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization and impairment charges total operating expenses income from operations other income  net gain on extinguishment of debt net interest expense non operating expenses income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview the facility rationalization project at our band division was completed  and production at closed plants was moved into existing plants 
however  the us economic crisis adversely impacted fourth quarter band revenues  since dealers only ordered products that they could resell quickly 
nevertheless  margins improved despite the million incurred due to plant closures 
piano division revenues and margins decreased due to domestic piano results 
fewer steinway grand unit sales and the adverse impact of domestic manufacturing facility shutdowns  which were taken in an effort to control inventory  were the primary causes 
piano division results include the operations of our online music division 
our fall budgeting and planning process provides multi year cash flow projections which we use to conduct our annual impairment testing of intangible assets 
recent decreases in order volume  the adverse impact of unavailable sourced products  delays in producing new product lines  and recent economic events  coupled with other factors  caused us to lower sales expectations 
as a result  our future anticipated cash flows at the band division were reduced and our goodwill was determined to be impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an million charge during the period to fully write off this asset 
analyses of band division trademarks and other assets during the fall indicated no other impairment  so no further charges have been taken 
our analysis of the piano division s intangible assets in the fall indicated no impairment charge was required 
we performed an update of our analysis as of december  due to current economic conditions 
no other impairments were noted 
net sales net sales decreased million which is attributable to both band and domestic piano division performance 
band division revenues decreased million  virtually all of which was caused by the decrease in brass and woodwind unit shipments in the fourth quarter 
this was mitigated by a shift towards higher priced intermediate and professional level instruments and improved percussion instrument sales 
piano revenue  which included million of online music retail sales  deteriorated million due to the million decrease in domestic piano revenues 
steinway grand unit shipments decreased and mid priced piano line shipments decreased domestically as demand fell at both the wholesale and retail level 
overseas piano sales improved million  which includes million in foreign currency translation 
steinway grand unit shipments were lower  although mid priced piano line shipments remained stable 
gross profit gross profit fell million due to lower domestic piano sales and margins 
although we incurred million in severance and other charges associated with the facility rationalization project  band gross profit was consistent due to the million reduction in pension and retirement benefit costs 
unabsorbed overhead and production variances were also lower than in piano segment gross profit dropped million primarily due to the decline in domestic piano sales 
the overseas margin remained unchanged from the prior period at 
domestically  margins dropped from to due to the reduction in production  which was implemented in order to control inventory levels 
the absence of a higher margin limited edition piano  lower margins on mid priced piano shipments due to unfavorable exchange rates  and higher physical inventory adjustments  which were atypically favorable in  were also factors in the margin deterioration 
operating expenses operating expenses were million lower primarily due to the million reduction in bad debt expense 
advertising expenses  salaries  commissions  and professional fees also decreased 
facility rationalization and impairment charges facility rationalization and impairment charges of million are comprised of million associated with the write off of goodwill discussed above and million in facility impairment charges at band locations that have been closed or sold 
non operating expenses non operating expenses decreased million due to the million gain on extinguishment of million of our senior notes 
a million shift from foreign exchange losses to foreign exchange gains also contributed to the improvement 
lower legal fees associated with the west th street building were offset by losses on our serp assets 
net interest expense decreased million primarily due to the extinguishment of million of our bond debt early in the year 
fewer borrowings on our domestic line of credit also contributed to the improvement 
liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our working capital lines  to finance our operations  repay or repurchase long term indebtedness  finance acquisitions  and fund our capital expenditures 
our overseas divisions  particularly those in asia  are normally in a borrowing position on their lines 
these borrowings are likely to be less than million at any given time 
in  domestic borrowings peaked at million  due to the dividend we issued in march  coupled with seasonal borrowings and the semi annual interest payment on our bonds 
in  our domestic line went virtually unused until the fourth quarter  when we borrowed million to ensure short term liquidity 
we paid down million of that balance prior to december  in  we utilized our domestic line of credit most of the year  and our borrowings reached a high of million  largely to ensure short term liquidity by maintaining a substantial cash balance 
however  we paid down our domestic borrowings in november and december and had nothing outstanding as of december  cash flows our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities in  cash flows from operating activities increased million 
reduced production and purchasing resulted in an improvement of cash provided by inventory of million while cash used for liabilities decreased million due to fewer purchases and controlled spending 
the beneficial impact of these items more than offset the decrease in net income 
in  cash flows from operating activities decreased million 
cash used for inventory increased million due to the band division  which experienced an unexpected inventory buildup due to a million reduction in sales  virtually all of which occurred in the fourth quarter 
also  cash used for liability related items increased million due to large pension contributions  tax related payments  and reductions in employee benefit and deferred income accruals 
these items exceeded the positive impact of cash provided by accounts receivable  which increased million largely due to more stringent credit criteria at the band division 
in  cash flows from operating activities increased million primarily due to the million shift from net loss to net income 
cash provided by operating liabilities decreased million due to lower environmental  legal  and other liabilities 
cash provided by inventory decreased million  as we continued to carry excess inventory at our domestic piano division 
in  cash used for investing activities dropped million 
in  we acquired arkiv and clickpoint and paid out million related to acquisitions see note 
in  acquisition activity was limited to the purchase of a retail store in dusseldorf  germany for million 
although capital expenditures were million lower than the year ago period  proceeds from sales of property were lower by the same amount 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million due to our acquisitions of arkiv and clickpoint 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million  largely due to the absence of securities sales which occurred in the prior year 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased million 
although we received million in proceeds from sales of our stock  we utilized million to pay off our domestic line of credit  million to pay down our foreign borrowings  and million to repurchase million in principal of our senior notes 
in  cash provided by financing activities shifted million largely due to the million outstanding borrowing on our domestic line of credit  in comparison to the use of million used to pay dividends in despite this dividend payment and million less in proceeds from issuance of stock  cash used for financing activities in decreased million because we did not have any debt restructuring activities  as in the prior year 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of production equipment  plant and facility improvements  and software and computer system upgrades 
we expect capital spending in to be in the range of to million  relating to similar items  along with to million for improvements and renovations at our building in new york city 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have large working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately to million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately to million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating payments on purchases made from october through august of the following year are due in october 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing dealers that meet certain credit qualifications may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered primarily in october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
the terms of the notes generally include payment over a nine to twelve month period with interest ranging from to generally to over prime 
interest rates are contingent upon credit ratings and borrowing periods 
in certain situations  we have offered long term arrangements for up to thirty six months 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
other financing arrangements we established a program in to provide financing to certain domestic piano dealers 
as of december   the total financing available to these dealers was less than million 
beyond this program  we generally do not provide extended financing arrangements to our piano dealers 
typically  if financing is required by a dealer  we will facilitate arrangements through a third party provider 
we generally provide no guarantees with respect to these arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our actuaries and our investment committee  and is consistent with that of prior years 
we believe that is consistent with the historical long term return trends on our domestic pension assets and our expectations for future returns 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for our domestic plans is based on a long term bond yield curve which matches the expected benefit payment period under the plan 
the bonds used have been rated aa or aa or better by recognized rating agencies  are non callable  and have at least million par outstanding to ensure they are sufficiently marketable 
the discount rates used for december  and were and for our domestic pension plan and and for our postretirement benefit obligation plan 
the weighted average discount rates and as of december  and  respectively and rates of return as of december  and on plan assets for our foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans were similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur in the applicable jurisdiction 
borrowing activities and availability we have a domestic credit facility with a syndicate of domestic lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans  and expires on september  it also provides for borrowings at either london interbank offering rate libor plus a range from to or as needed borrowings at an alternate base rate  plus a range from to  both ranges depend upon availability at the time of borrowing 
borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
our non domestic credit facilities provide for borrowings equivalent to million as of december  there have been no material changes to our borrowing abilities overseas  and we typically are in a borrowing position of less than million at any given time 
our non domestic credit facilities are discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes due march  and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
we had nothing outstanding on our domestic line of credit as of december  cash interest paid was million in  million in  and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities  and make cash dividend payments 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and do not anticipate any compliance issues in our domestic debt agreements contain limitations  based on net income among other things  on the amount of discretionary repurchases we may make of our ordinary common stock 
our intent and ability to repurchase additional ordinary common stock either directly from shareholders or on the open market is directly affected by this limitation 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
in normal economic conditions  we are able to effectively utilize cash flow from operations to fund our debt and capital requirements and pay off our seasonal borrowings on our domestic line of credit 
however  given the current global economy  we anticipate a challenging market for both our piano and band divisions in despite this  we do not anticipate any adverse impact on our liquidity as we received million in proceeds from a sale of stock in november we also entered into a contract to sell an additional  shares at a price of by march   and currently expect to receive an additional million in early we intend to manage accounts receivable and credit risk  and control inventory levels via reduced purchases and production schedules 
we have also taken measures to minimize non critical expenditures  and have forgone salary increases and discretionary benefit program contributions 
our intention is to manage cash outflow  maintain sufficient operating cash on hand to meet short term requirements  and minimize credit facility borrowings 
we do not have any current plans or intentions that will have a material impact on our liquidity in  although we may consider acquisitions or debt reductions that may require funding from operations or from our credit facilities 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility and non domestic credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other non current liabilities total notes to contractual obligations long term debt represents long term debt obligations  the fixed interest on our senior notes  and the variable interest on our other loans 
we estimated the future variable interest obligation using the applicable december  rates 
the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the land lease associated with steinway hall  which has eighty eight years remaining  and is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of firm purchase commitments for raw materials  finished goods  and equipment 
our other non current liabilities consist primarily of the long term portion of our pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  and obligations under employee and consultant agreements  which are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
we have not included million of uncertain tax positions within this schedule due to the uncertainty of the payment date  if any 
critical accounting estimates the sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies based on the definition above 
accounts receivable we establish reserves for accounts receivable and notes receivable 
we review overall collectibility trends and customer characteristics such as debt leverage  solvency  and outstanding balances in order to develop our reserve estimates 
historically  a large portion of our sales at both our piano and band divisions has been generated by our top customers 
as a result  we experience some inherent concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable due to its composition and the relative proportion of large customer receivables to the total 
this is especially true at our band division  which characteristically has a majority of our consolidated accounts receivable balance 
we consider the credit health and solvency of our customers when developing our receivable reserve estimates 
inventory we establish inventory reserves for items such as lower of cost or market and obsolescence 
we review inventory levels on a detailed basis  concentrating on the age and amounts of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods  as well as recent usage and sales dates and quantities to help develop our estimates 
ongoing changes in our business strategy  including a shift from batch processing to single piece production flow  coupled with increased offshore sourcing  could affect our ability to realize the current cost of our inventory  and are considered by management when developing our estimates 
we also establish reserves for anticipated book to physical adjustments based upon our historical level of adjustments from our annual physical inventories 
we account for our inventory using standard costs 
accordingly  variances between actual and standard costs that are not abnormal in nature are capitalized into inventory and released based on calculated inventory turns 
abnormal costs are expensed in the period in which they occur 
workers compensation and self insured health claims we establish self insured workers compensation and health claims reserves based on our trend analysis of data provided by third party administrators regarding historical claims and anticipated future claims 
warranty we establish reserves for warranty claims based on our analysis of historical claims data  recent claims trends  and the various lengths of time for which we warranty our products 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we establish long lived intangible assets based on estimated fair values  and amortize finite lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived trademark assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset may have decreased below its carrying value 
our assessment is based on several analyses  including a comparison of net book value to estimated fair values  market capitalization  and multi year cash flows 
pensions and other postretirement benefit costs we make certain assumptions when calculating our benefit obligations and expenses 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as discount rates and long term rates of return  on information provided by our actuaries  investment advisors  investment committee  current rate trends  and historical trends for our pension asset portfolio 
our benefit obligations and expenses can fluctuate based on the assumptions management selects 
income taxes we record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards 
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
the ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon many factors  including the ratio of foreign source income to overall income and generation of sufficient future taxable income in the states for which we have loss carryforwards 
when establishing or adjusting valuation allowances  we consider these factors  as well as anticipated trends in foreign source income and tax planning strategies which may impact future realizability of these assets 
a liability has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 
when analyzing these positions  we consider the probability of various outcomes which could result from examination  negotiation  or settlement with various taxing authorities 
the final outcome on these positions could differ significantly from our original estimates due to the following expiring statutes of limitations  availability of detailed historical data  results of audits or examinations conducted by taxing authorities or agents that vary from management s anticipated results  identification of new tax contingencies  release of applicable administrative tax guidance  management s decision to settle or appeal assessments  or the rendering of court decisions affecting our estimates of tax liabilities  as well as other factors 
stock based compensation we grant stock based compensation awards which generally vest over a specified period 
when determining the fair value of stock options and subscriptions to purchase shares under the employee stock purchase plan purchase plan  we use the black scholes option valuation model  which requires input of certain management assumptions  including dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life of stock options granted during the period  and the life applicable to the purchase plan subscriptions 
the estimated fair value of the options and subscriptions to purchase shares  and the resultant stock based compensation expense  can fluctuate based on the assumptions used by management 
environmental liabilities we make certain assumptions when calculating our environmental liabilities 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as cost and length of time for remediation  on data provided by our environmental consultants  as well as information provided by regulatory authorities 
we also make certain assumptions regarding the indemnifications we have received from others  including whether remediation costs are within the scope of the indemnification  the indemnifier s ability to perform under the agreement  and whether past claims have been successful 
our environmental obligations and expenses can fluctuate based on management s assumptions 
we believe the assumptions made by management provide a reasonable basis for the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles overall 
fasb asc establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification to become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  asc  which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities 
specifically  the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity  and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed 
we will be required to comply with this new standard on january  we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  accounting standards update asu  which provides additional guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value 
specifically  when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  the new standard requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one or more of the valuation techniques that should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability 
we were required to comply with this standard in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued  which amends the existing fair value measurements and disclosures guidance 
these amendments require a greater level of disaggregated information as well as more disclosure around valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
the amendments also provide guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets 
we will be required to comply with this new standard on january  we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate some of our cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the contracts relate primarily to intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current forward rate 
however  we would offset any such gains and losses by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related asset or liability 
interest risk our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
our revolving loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in prime  libor  tibor  and euribor and are therefore sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by less than million 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these senior notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december
