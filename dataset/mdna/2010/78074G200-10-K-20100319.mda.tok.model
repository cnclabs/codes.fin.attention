item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with royale energy s financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information relating to royale energy included elsewhere in this document 
for the past sixteen years  royale energy has primarily acquired and developed producing and non producing natural gas properties in california 
in  royale energy began developing leases in utah 
the most significant factors affecting the results of operations are i changes in oil and natural gas production levels and reserves  ii recording of turnkey drilling revenues and the associated drilling expense  and iii the change in commodities price of natural gas and oil reserves owned by royale energy 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition royale energy s financial statements include its pro rata ownership of wells 
royale energy usually sells a portion of the working interest in each lease that it acquires to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account 
royale energy generally retains about a working interest 
all results  successful or not  are included at its pro rata ownership amounts revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
royale energy has developed two profit oriented segments of business marketing direct working interests dwi  and producing and selling oil and gas 
royale energy derives dwi revenue from sales of working interests to high net worth individuals 
the dwi revenue is divided into payments for pre drilling costs and for drilling costs 
dwi investments are non refundable 
royale energy recognizes the pre drilling revenue portion when the investor deposits money with royale energy 
the company holds the remaining investment in trust as deferred turnkey drilling until drilling is complete 
occasionally  drilling is delayed due to the permitting process  or drilling rig availability 
at december  and  royale energy had deferred turnkey drilling of  and  respectively 
the primary business segment is oil and gas production 
northern and central california account for approximately of the company s successful natural gas production in natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems  which are equipped occasionally with compressor systems  which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines 
monthly  price data and daily production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to royale energy and other working interest owners 
royale energy operates virtually all of its own wells and receives industry standard operator fees 
oil and gas property and equipment royale energy follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs are accumulated on a field by field basis 
these costs include pre drilling activities such as leasing rents paid  drilling costs  and post drilling tangible costs 
costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
royale energy regularly evaluates its unproved properties on a field by field basis for possible impairment 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
depletion the units of production method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgment determinations 
independent engineering reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data and economic changes 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and royale energy consider s such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the independent engineering estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history and changes in economic factors 
impairment of assets producing property costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than net book value pursuant to the extractive activities topic of the financial accounting standard board s fasb accounting standards codification 
impairment of non producing leasehold costs and undeveloped mineral and royalty interests are assessed periodically on a property by property basis and any impairment in value is charged to expense 
we periodically review for impairment of proved properties on a field by field basis 
unamortized capital costs are measured on a field basis and are reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows are less than the net book value 
we determine if impairm ent has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of its periodic review for impairment 
impairment is measured on undiscounted cash flows 
we regard impairment costs of undeveloped properties as a component of our turnkey drilling overhead  since impairment costs amount to a write down of previously acquired property inventory that we were unable to successfully develop as part of our turnkey drilling program 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates pertain to proved oil  plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
results of operations for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  a  improvement when compared to the net loss of  during this improvement was due to company wide efforts to control and reduce costs 
total revenues from operations for the year in were  a decrease of  or  from the total revenues of  in this decrease in revenues was due to several factors  including the industry wide decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices which affected our oil and natural gas production revenues  and decreased turnkey drilling revenues due to lower direct working interest sales 
although revenues decreased expenses also decreased 
total costs and expenses fell from  in to  in  a  or decrease 
the decreased costs and expenses also translated into a decrease in the company s loss from operations from  in to  in  an  decrease 
in  revenues from oil and gas production decreased by to  from  in  due to lower commodity prices received for our oil and natural gas production 
the net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended december   was approximately  mcf with an average price of per mcf  versus  mcf with an average price of per mcf for this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  mcf or 
this decrease in production was due to a natural decline in production from existing oil and gas wells 
the net sales volume for oil and condensate natural gas liquids production was approximately  barrels with an average price of per barrel for the year ended december   compared to  barrels at an average price of per barrel for the year in this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  barrels  or 
oil and gas lease operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year in this decrease was mainly due to lower workover and plugging and abandonment costs  as cost reduction measures were implemented in when measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis  in  the  equates to a per mcfe lifting cost versus a per mcfe lifting cost in  a decrease 
for the year ended december   turnkey drilling revenues decreased  to  in from  in  or 
we also had a  or decrease in turnkey drilling and development costs to  in from  in in we drilled five wells  three exploratory wells and two developmental wells versus two exploratory wells and five developmental wells in our gross margins  or profits  on drilling depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with the development of projects in which we sell working interests and to acquire viable properties that can be successfully developed 
costs associated with contract drilling depend on location  well depth  weather  and availability of drilling contractors and equipment 
our gross margin on drilling increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin is calculated as the difference between turnkey drilling revenue and turnkey drilling expense 
however  management believes that a portion of its impairment losses should also be considered as a cost of drilling in determining the profitability of this segment  because impairment costs are incurred in the selection of higher quality prospects for ultimate development 
impairment losses of  and  were recorded in and  respectively 
in both years  we recorded impairments in fields where year end reserve values were less than the net book values of wells or where lease and land costs that were no longer viable 
in  the majority of the impairment   was recorded in our utah fields  where various recently drilled wells had significantly lower proved developed nonproducing reserves than originally estimated 
much of these were costs carried over from wells drilled in our elkhorn slough and east rice creek fields  both in california  were impaired  and  respectively  due to lower proved producing reserves than their current book values 
two other california fields  the rio vista and bower bank  were impaired  and  respectively  due to lower proved undeveloped reserves than originally estimated 
in   of this impairment was recorded in our utah field where the weather delays caused lower than expected production to support the proved reserves values that were lower than their current net book values 
the texas and gulf coast fields were impaired  of which  was due to wells which had lower proved reserve values than their current net book values and  was due to previously capitalized lease and land costs which were not expected to be developed within the current year 
we impaired two wells in california 
one drilled in was impaired for  and the other a workover was impaired  due to lower reserves 
two fields in california  the elkhorn slough and bowerbank  were impaired  and  respectively due to lower proved reserves than their current book values 
additionally in and  we recorded lease impairments of  and  respectively  on various capitalized lease and land costs that were no longer viable 
bad debt expense for and was  and  respectively 
these expenses arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned or scheduled for plugging and abandonment 
in  approximately of these expenses stem from one of our california wells 
we periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges where doubtful 
by contract  the company may not collect some charges from its direct working interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year  to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue 
as a result of those reviews in and  we increased the allowance fr om  at december  to  at december   for receivables from these direct working interest owners 
the aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from  during the year in this increase was mainly due to the granting of a seismic license to an industry member for which we were compensated 
supervisory fees are charged in accordance with the council for petroleum accountants societies copas policy for reimbursement of expenses associated with the joint accounting for billing  revenue disbursement  and payment of taxes and royalties 
these charges are reevaluated each year and adjusted up or down as deemed appropriate by a published report to the industry by ernst young  llp  public accountants 
supervisory fees decreased  or  to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased to  from  a decrease of  for the year ended december   as compared to the depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves 
this decrease in depletion expense was mainly due to the decrease in our oil and gas asset base from our impairments 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year in this decrease was primarily due to reductions in employee related expenses such as salaries  taxes and insurances  implemented in our cost control measures 
legal and accounting expense decreased to  for the year  compared to  for  a  or decrease 
this decrease was a result of lower legal fees due to litigation defending property rights in  which culminated in a trial and a successful outcome for the company in april of marketing expense for the year ended december   decreased  or  to  compared to  for the year in marketing expense usually varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs 
in  our cost containment measures led to decreases primarily in marketing related travel and exhibition costs 
in and  we recorded gains on the sales of assets of  and  respectively 
both gains can be primarily attributable to the sale of our rio bravo field located in kern county  california in september for million 
this resulted in a net gain from the sale of  in and an additional gain through a reconciling adjustment of  in additionally  royale recognized a loss from the sale of its marketable securities of  in during  interest expense decreased to  from  in  a  or decrease 
this was due to a decrease in the usage of our bank line of credit 
further details concerning royale s line of credit usage can be found in the capital resources and liquidity section below 
in  we had an income tax benefit of  mainly due to our net loss before taxes of  in  we also had an income tax benefit of  also due to our net loss before taxes of  the use of percentage depletion created from the current operations  and from utilization of unused percentage depletion carryforwards  results in an effective tax rate less than the normal federal rate of plus the relevant state rates mostly california  results of operations for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  compared to the net loss of  during the loss was primarily the result of an impairment of  due to a decrease in asset reserve values at year end this was mainly due to the industry wide collapse of oil and natural gas prices at year end which reduced reserve values 
total revenues from operations for the year in were  an increase of  or  from the total revenues of  in in our turnkey drilling revenues increased due to an increase in the number of wells drilled and our natural gas revenues increased due to higher mid year natural gas and oil prices 
higher turnkey drilling revenues accounted for of the increase 
in  revenues from oil and gas production increased by to  from  in  due to higher mid year prices that the industry experienced for a portion of the net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended december   was approximately  mcf with an average price of per mcf  versus  mcf with an average price of per mcf for this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  mcf or 
this decrease in production was due to a natural decline in production from existing oil and gas wells 
the net sales volume for oil and condensate natural gas liquids production was approximately  barrels with an average price of per barrel for the year ended december   compared to  barrels at an average p rice of per barrel for the year in this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  barrels  or 
oil and gas lease operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year in this increase was mainly due to higher plugging and abandoning and workover costs during the period in when compared to  as we continue efforts to increase production on some of our existing wells 
when measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis  in  the  equates to a per mcfe lifting cost versus a per mcfe lifting cost in  a increase 
without plugging  abandonment  and workover costs  our lifting costs would have been  or per mcfe 
for the year ended december   turnkey drilling revenues increased  to  in from  in  or 
we also had a  or increase in turnkey drilling and development costs to  in from  in in  we drilled seven wells and incurred work over expenses for an existing well and we expensed another  previously drilled exploratory dry hole in we drilled five developmental wells and two exploratory wells in versus four exploratory wells and three developmental wells in our gross margins  or profits  on drilling depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with the development of projects in which we sell working interests and to acquire viable properties that can be successfull y developed 
costs associated with contract drilling depend on location  well depth  weather  and availability of drilling contractors and equipment 
our gross margin on drilling increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin is calculated as the difference between turnkey drilling revenue and turnkey drilling expense 
however  management believes that a portion of its impairment losses should also be considered as a cost of drilling in determining the profitability of this segment  because impairment costs are incurred in the selection of higher quality prospects for ultimate development 
impairment losses of  and  were recorded in and  respectively 
in and  we recorded impairments in fields where year end reserve values were less than the net book values of wells in those fields 
in   of this impairment was recorded in our utah field where the weather delays caused lower than expected production to support the proved reserves values that were lower than their current net book values 
the texas and gulf coast fields were impaired  of which  was due to wells which had lower proved reserve values than their current net book values and  was due to previously capitalized lease and land costs which were not expected to be developed within the current year 
we impaired two wells in california  one drilled in was impaired for  and the other a workover was impaired  due to lower reserves 
two fields in california  the elkhorn slough and bowerbank  were impaired  and  respectively due to lower proved reserves than their current book values 
in  the majority of this impairment   was recorded in our bowerbank field in california  where various recently drilled wells had significantly lower proved undeveloped reserves than originally estimated 
the afton field in california was impaired for  mainly on acquired wells which ceased producing due to their natural declines and had lower reserves than originally estimated 
our texas and gulf coast fields were impaired  due to wells in these areas which had lower production and reserves than originally estimated 
our elkhorn slough field was impaired for  due to lower proved undeveloped reserves than originally estimated 
we periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges where doubtful 
by contract  the company may not collect some charges from its direct working interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year  to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue 
as a result of that review in and  we established an allowance of  and  respectively  for receivables from these direct working interest owners 
the aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  during the year in this decrease was the result of several factors including the decrease in cost recovery received for use of facilities constructed and placed into service during prior periods as a result of lower production levels 
supervisory fees are charged in accordance with the council for petroleum accountants societies copas policy for reimbursement of expenses associated with the joint accounting for billing  revenue disbursement  and payment of taxes and royalties 
these charges are reevaluated each year and adjusted up or down as deemed appropriate by a published report to the industry by ernst young  llp  public accountants 
 supervisory fees decreased  or  to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to  from  an increase of  for the year ended december   as compared to the depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves 
this increase in depletion expense was mainly due to the decrease in our oil and gas reserves at year end as the result of minor cost cutting measures  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year in legal and accounting expense increased to  for the year  compared to  for year  a  or increase 
this increase was due to higher legal fees due to litigation defending property rights during and marketing expense for the year ended december   decreased  or  to  compared to  for the year in marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs 
in september  the company sold its rio bravo field located in kern county  california for million  resulting in a net gain from the sale of  during the first quarter in  we also recorded a loss of  on the sale of a non oil and gas asset 
during  we sold our interests in two non oil and gas assets resulting in a loss on sale of  during  interest expense increased to  from  in  a  or increase 
this was due to an increase in the usage of our bank line of credit 
in  we had an income tax benefit of  mainly due to our net loss before taxes of  in  we also had an income tax benefit of  also due to our net loss before taxes of  the use of percentage depletion created from the current operations  and from utilization of unused percentage depletion carryforwards  results in an effective tax rate less than the normal federal rate of plus the relevant state rates mostly california  capital resources and liquidity at december   royale energy had current assets totaling  and current liabilities totaling  a  working capital deficit 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of  compared to  at december  our capital expenditure commitments occur as we decide to drill wells to develop our prospects 
we generally do not decide to drill any prospect until we have sold a portion of the working interest in a prospect to third parties to diversify our risk and receive a portion of the funds to drill each prospect 
we place funds that we receive from third party investors into a separate cash account until they are required for expenditures on each well 
our capital expenditure needs in addition to those needs are satisfied by selling part of the working interest in prospects 
we have not  in past years  experienced shortages of funds needed to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements 
we expect that our available credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for capital expenditure needs beyond those satisfied from sales of working interests 
we ordinarily fund our operations and cash needs from cash flows generated from operations 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for and do not foresee any liquidity demands that cannot be met from cash flow from operations 
at the end of  our accounts receivable totaled  compared to  at december   a  or decrease  primarily due to lower receivables from an industry member participating in wells we drilled at the end of at december   our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled  a decrease of  or over the accounts payable at the end of of  this decrease was due to applying prepaid drilling remittances to accounts payable in addition to payments made on other trade account payables 
during  royale energy maintained a revolving credit agreement with guaranty bank  fsb  secured by all of our oil and gas properties  which at december   had outstanding indebtedness of  in february  the guaranty bank loan was repaid and we entered into a new agreement with texas capital bank  na for a new revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility  also secured by our oil and gas properties  of up to  and separate letter of credit facility of up to  for the purposes of refinancing royale s existing debt and to fund development  exploration and acquisition activities as well as other general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the agreement  royale energy may borrow  repay  and re borrow funds as necessary 
interest is to be the greater of texas capital bank s base rate and the federal funds rate but in no event less than per year 
on january   texas capital bank re determined the borrowing base to be  with monthly borrowing base reductions of  commencing on february  all unpaid principal and interest is payable at maturity on february  at december   we had a current borrowing base and outstanding indebtedness on this loan of  the texas capital bank loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including a prohibition of payment of dividends on royale s stock other than dividends paid in stock 
the loan agreement contains covenants that  among other things  royale must maintain a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense of at lest to maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least to  and maintain a tangible net worth as of the close of each fiscal quarter of at least of royale s tangible net worth on the loan closing date  plus of positive quarterly net income thereafter 
at december   we were not in compliance with the current ratio financial covenant of our loan agreement with the bank  but we have obtained a waiver from the terms of that loan covenant 
we are not in default on any principal  interest or sinking fund payment 
we do not engage in hedging activities or use derivative instruments to manage market risks 
the following schedule summarizes our known contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total obligations beyond office lease long term debt total operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities totaled  compared to  provided by operating activities for the year in this difference in cash was due primarily to a significant decrease in our trade accounts payable and lower direct working interest sales during the year in when comparing the cash provided by operating activities of  to  provided by operating activities for the same period in  there was a  or decrease  which was mainly due to our decrease in deferred income taxes due to our year end loss which provided an income tax benefit for the company 
investing activities 
for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was  compared to  used by investing activities in  a decrease of  or 
the activity includes  used mainly for oil and gas capital expenditures  along with proceeds of  generated from the sale of our rio bravo field during the third quarter of the decrease in drilling expenditures during the year in was due to the drilling of fewer and lower cost wells 
beginning in july  the company began to purchase a material amount of equity securities 
based upon management s intent for the items  the company had categorized these as available for sale securities 
 for the year ended december   we had purchased  and sold  in equity securities 
during the third quarter of  the company liquidated all its equity securities 
for year in  our equity sales and purchases generated  in  net cash used by investing activities netted to  for the year in  which included  used mainly for oil and gas capital expenditures  along with proceeds from the sale of non oil and gas assets of  financing activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was  compared to  provided by financing activities in  a  difference 
in august  royale energy received net proceeds of  through the sale of common stock and warrants to one investor in a private placement 
the proceeds were used to increase our stockholders equity and working capital  due originally to the receipt of the nasdaq non compliance notice  see item market for common equity and related stockholder matters 
additionally  during september and october we received net proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants for  shares from the august private placement 
in october  royale energy received net proceeds of  through the private placement of common stock and warrants to one investor 
the proceeds were used to assist in the development a new natural gas field discovery in california 
during the first quarter of  we paid off our line of credit with guaranty bank and established a new one with texas capital bank 
in the second quarter of we received net proceeds of  from the sale of common stock and warrants to one investor in a private placement 
the proceeds were used to pay  to reduce long term debt payments and for working capital 
in  we also received  from the exercise of stock options 
for  cash provided by financing activities was  primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on our commercial bank line of credit during the year 
also i n january  the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share for shareholders of record on february  this dividend was paid march   in the amount of  changes in reserve estimates due to recent discoveries  our overall all proved developed and undeveloped reserves increased by in while our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised downward slightly by approximately 
million cubic feet of natural gas 
see supplemental information about oil and gas producing activities unaudited  page f approximately of the revision came from three existing california wells which had lower than previously estimated proved producing gas reserves 
the other came from two california prospects which had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped gas reserves  were reevaluated and found to have lower than expected reserves and as a result were not drilled 
in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised slightly upward by approximately 
million cubic feet of natural gas mainly due to two california wells which had higher than originally estimated proved producing reserves 
also in our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil reserves were revised upward by approximately  barrels primarily due to one texas well which had higher than originally estimated proved producing reserves 
the following table summarizes the major reasons for reserve increases in oil gas two existing wells with higher estimated proved producing gas reserves one existing well with higher estimated proved producing oil reserves one existing well with lower estimated proved non producing gas reserves increase of proved undeveloped reserves in one existing well reduction of pud in one existing well total in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately million cubic feet of natural gas 
during  it was discovered that two producing wells had lower than previously estimated proved producing gas reserves  resulting in a reduction of proved developed producing gas reserves 
there were also reductions on two additional producing wells that had lower than previously estimated proved non producing reserves 
also during  four prospects that had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped gas reserve were re evaluated and found to have lower than expected reserves and as a result were not drilled 
three other prospects that had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped gas reserve are still being evaluated and pending final results expected reserves were reduced 
one other prospect with proved undeveloped reserves were drilled and resulted in proved reserves less than prior estimates 
the revisions of previous estimates attributable to these wells accounted for approximately of the net downward revisions of previous gas reserve estimates 
the following table summarizes the major reasons for reserve reductions in gas two existing wells with lower estimated proved producing reserves two existing wells with lower estimated proved non producing reserves reduction of pud due to four undrilled wells reduction of pud due to three undrilled wells pending evaluation reduction of pud based on drilling results total item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk royale energy is exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices and in interest rates 
in  we sold a majority of our natural gas at the daily market rate through the pacific gas electric pipeline 
in  our natural gas revenues were approximately million with an average price of per mcf 
at current production levels  a per mcf increase or decrease in our average price received could potentially increase or decrease our natural gas revenues by approximately  at our current production levels of oil and natural gas condensate  a increase or decrease in our average price per barrel could potentially increase or decrease our oil and natural gas revenues by approximately  we currently do not sell any of our natural gas or oil through hedging c ontracts 
we have a line of credit used in funding purchases of oil and gas assets  meeting drilling schedules and assisting in funding operations 
this line of credit is tied to increases or decreases in the bank prime interest rate 
if the interest rate on our line of credit were to increase or during the year this could potentially add approximately  to  respectively  to our interest expense
