general management overview spin off in connection with a plan by iac interactivecorp iac to separate into five publicly traded companies  interval leisure group  inc ilg was incorporated as a delaware corporation in may we refer to the separation transaction as the spin off 
prior to the spin off  ilg did not have any material assets or liabilities  nor did it engage in any business or other activities and  other than in connection with the spin off  did not acquire or incur any material assets or liabilities 
since completion of the spin off  ilg consists of two operating segments  interval and aston 
interval consists of interval international  inc and its subsidiaries  other than those in the aston segment 
aston consists of aston hotels resorts  llc and maui condo and home  llc  which were acquired on may  these businesses formerly comprised iac s interval segment 
the businesses operated by ilg following the spin off are referred to herein as the ilg businesses 
after the close of the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq on august   iac completed the spin off of ilg  following the transfer of all of the outstanding stock of interval acquisition corp  which directly and through subsidiaries holds the ownership interest in those entities and net assets that conduct the ilg businesses  to ilg 
in connection with the spin off  we completed the following transactions extinguished the receivable from iac  which totaled million  by recording a non cash distribution to iac  recapitalized the invested capital balance with the issuance of million shares of ilg common stock whereby each holder of one share of iac 
table of contents common stock received of an ilg share  entered into an indenture pursuant to which we issued to iac million of senior unsecured notes due  entered into a senior secured credit facility with a maturity of five years  which consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility and transferred to iac all domestic cash  excluding restricted cash  in excess of million  distributing to iac million of cash from the proceeds of the term loan 
due to a reconciliation of federal and state income taxes for the period prior to the spin off and as provided for in the tax sharing agreement entered into with iac  we recorded a million increase to the amount distributed to iac in connection with a reduced income tax liability 
additionally  in connection with the spin off  on august   iac and ilg entered into several agreements with respect to spin off and transaction matters 
after the spin off  our shares began trading on the nasdaq under the symbol iilg 
basis of presentation the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg and its subsidiaries and the disclosure set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the contribution or other transfer to ilg of all of the subsidiaries and assets and the assumption by ilg of all of the liabilities relating to the ilg businesses in connection with the spin off  and the allocation to ilg of certain iac corporate expenses relating to the ilg businesses prior to the spin off 
accordingly  the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg reflect the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the ilg businesses since their respective dates of acquisition by iac  based on the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of iac and using the historical results of operations and historical basis of the assets and liabilities of the ilg businesses with the exception of accounting for income taxes 
for purposes of these financial statements  income taxes have been computed for ilg on an as if stand alone  separate tax return basis 
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated 
in the opinion of ilg s management  the assumptions underlying the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg are reasonable 
however  this financial information  prior to the spin off  does not reflect what the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of ilg would have been had ilg been a stand alone company during the periods presented prior to the spin off 
general description of our business ilg is a leading global provider of membership and leisure services to the vacation industry 
we operate in two business segments interval and aston 
our principal business segment  interval  offers travel and leisure related products and services to owners of vacation interests and others enrolled in various membership programs  as well as related services to its resort developer clients 
aston  our other business segment  was acquired in may and provides hotel and resort management and vacation rental services to both vacationers and vacation property owners principally in hawaii 
vacation ownership membership services interval interval has been a leader in the vacation ownership membership services industry since its founding in  and we operate a quality international vacation ownership membership exchange network  the interval network 
as of december  the large and diversified base of resorts participating in the interval network consisted of more than  resorts located in more than countries and included both leading independent resort developers and branded hospitality companies  over million vacation ownership interest owners were enrolled as members of the interval network  and 
table of contents the average tenure of the relationships with the top resort developers as determined by the number of new members enrolled during the year ended december  was approximately years 
interval typically enters into multi year contracts with developers of vacation ownership resorts  pursuant to which the resort developers agree to enroll all purchasers of vacation interests at the applicable resort as members of an interval exchange program 
in return  interval provides enrolled purchasers with the ability to exchange the use and occupancy of their vacation interest at the home resort generally for a period of one week for the right to occupy accommodations at a different resort participating in an interval exchange network or at the same resort during a different period of occupancy 
interval also provides travel related services for members residing in the united states and united kingdom 
through interval s getaways  members may rent resort accommodations for a fee without relinquishing the use of their vacation interest 
in addition  interval offers support  consulting and back office services  including reservation servicing  for certain resort developers participating in the interval network  upon their request and for additional consideration 
interval earns most of its revenue from i fees paid for membership in the interval network and ii transactional and service fees paid primarily for interval network exchanges  getaways and reservation servicing  collectively referred to as transaction revenue 
hotel and resort management and vacation rental services aston through aston  we provide hotel and resort management and vacation rental services for owners of resort condominiums  hotels and other vacation properties 
such vacation properties and hotels are not owned by us 
as of december   aston provided hotel and resort management services to resorts and hotels primarily in hawaii  as well as more limited management services to certain additional properties 
revenue from aston is derived principally from management fees for hotel and resort management and vacation rental services 
fees consist of a base management fee and  in some instances  an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
a majority of the resort management agreements provide that owners receive either specified percentages of the revenue generated under aston management or guaranteed dollar amounts 
in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operation are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages or amounts  and aston either retains the balance if any as its management fee or makes up the deficit 
in january  as part of its re branding campaign  resortquest hawaii returned to the name of aston hotels resorts 
international operations international revenue decreased approximately in compared to as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue decreased to in from in as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue was in international revenue in was affected by unfavorable foreign currency translations when compared to in constant currency  international revenue grew in compared to and as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue grew to in from in constant currency represents current period results of operations determined by translating our functional currency results to us dollars our reporting currency using the actual prior year blended 
table of contents rate of translation from the comparable prior period 
we believe that the presentation of our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency translations serves to enhance the understanding of our performance  improves transparency of our disclosures  provides meaningful presentations of our results from our business operations by excluding this effect not related to our core business operations and improves the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
other factors affecting results since the spin off in august  our results of operations have been impacted by a number of items that related to part of and all of results for include incremental interest expense of million and incremental stand alone and public company costs of million and unlike  do not include interest income of million from intercompany receivables 
the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures by resort developers spurred by the lack of receivables financing has continued  leading to a decrease in the flow of new members to our exchange networks 
while there has been some easing of credit markets  developers are continuing to re engineer their business models to reduce reliance on receivables financing 
our aston segment continues to be impacted by the decline in visitors to hawaii which decreased for the year ended december   according to the hawaii department of business  economic development tourism  dbedt 
while the dbedt forecasts a slight increase in visitors to hawaii in  visitor expenditures are forecasted to remain about the same as during the fourth quarter of  aston expanded beyond the hawaiian islands adding certain mainland locations 
we expect a ramp up period for these locations 
throughout  we saw continued pressures in the us and global economy related to the global economic downturn  the credit crisis  investment returns  and general negative consumer sentiment  all of which has impacted consumer discretionary spending in travel and leisure services 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
revenue recognition revenue  net of sales incentives  from interval membership fees is deferred and recognized over the terms of the applicable memberships ranging from one to five years  on a straight line basis 
generally  memberships are cancelable and refundable on a pro rata basis 
direct costs of acquiring members and direct costs of sales related to deferred membership revenue are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable memberships 
these costs relate to various commissions and initial fulfillment costs 
the recognition of previously deferred revenue and expense is based on estimates derived from an aggregation of member level data 
revenue from exchange and getaway transactions is recognized when interval provides confirmation of the transaction as the earnings process is complete 
reservation servicing revenue is recognized when service is performed or on a straight line basis over the applicable service period 
all taxable revenue transactions are presented on a net of tax basis 

table of contents aston s revenue consists primarily of hotel and resort management fees and service fees provided through contractual agreements with hotels  resorts and condominium owners 
hotel and resort management fees consist of base management fees ranging from to of adjusted gross lodging revenue  various revenue sharing arrangements with condominium owners based on stated formulas or a percentage of adjusted gross lodging revenue and incentive management fees which are generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
service fee revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
in certain instances aston arranges services which are provided directly to property owners 
transactions for these services do not impact our consolidated financial statements as they are not included in our results of operations 
additionally  aston employs on site personnel to provide services such as housekeeping  maintenance and administration to property owners under its hotel and resort management agreements 
aston recognizes revenue in an amount equal to the expenses incurred for such services 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets our policy goodwill and other intangible assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances  based on a two step impairment test 
we consider our interval and aston segments to be individual reporting units which are also individual operating segments of ilg 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach which utilizes similar companies as the basis for the valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over amounts assigned to its net assets 
the step one determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other estimates 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would use to price the asset or asset group 
during the year  we monitor the actual performance of our reporting units relative to the fair value assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test  including potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions 
for the year ended december   we did not identify any triggering events which required an interim impairment test prior or subsequent to our annual impairment test on october  
table of contents annual impairment test as of october   we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units 
as of october   the interval reporting unit goodwill and other intangible assets was million and the aston reporting unit goodwill was million 
we performed step one of the impairment test on both our interval and aston reporting units and concluded that interval s fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value  however  the carrying value of our aston reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 
consequently  we performed step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the resulting analysis concluded the fair value of aston s implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded 
the excess in the implied fair value of goodwill over its carrying value is attributable to declines in the fair value of aston s property management contracts and wholesaler agreement definite lived intangible assets  certain real estate assets used in the purveyance of revenue generating services pursuant to the aforementioned property management contracts and wholesaler agreements  and aston s tradename definite lived intangible asset 
as a result of the decline in fair value of these long lived assets  we performed a recoverability test pursuant to asc topic  property plant and equipment  asc as subsequently discussed in the recoverability of long lived assets section below 
key estimates and assumptions the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other key assumptions made by management  including discount rates  utilized in the valuation of certain identifiable assets 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our results of operations or unforeseen negative events could adversely affect either of our reporting units and lead to a revision of the estimates used to calculate fair value 
these key estimates and forecasted operating results may or may not occur or may be revised by management which may require us to recognize impairment losses in the future 
with respect to our interval reporting unit s step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include our discount rate and forecasted sales growth rates 
as previously noted  we use the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change in both our discount and long term growth rates would result in a change of million in the income approach fair value of the reporting unit  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our estimated ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in interval s market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of interval s fair value over its carrying value 
with respect to our aston reporting unit s step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change to all four forecasted key estimates would result in a change of approximately million in aston s income approach fair value  or approximately of the deficit of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our estimated ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in aston s market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the deficit of aston s fair value over its carrying value 
if either of these hypothetical changes occur  it is possible that aston s implied fair value of goodwill could fail to exceed its carrying value of goodwill and  consequently  a goodwill impairment would be recorded 

table of contents key estimates and assumptions for both our interval and aston reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances  as follows events and trends in the vacation ownership  vacation rental and travel industries that could adversely affect consumers travel to and vacation in certain destinations and regions in which vacation rental properties are located  including events such as declines in discretionary spending levels during general economic downturns 
inclement weather and or natural disasters 
travel health concerns such as the hn influenza outbreak and other pandemics 
concerns related to terrorism  enhanced travel security measures and or geographical conflicts 
additionally  key estimates and assumptions for interval and aston reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances specific to each reporting unit  such as interval the downturn in the economy may continue to cause decreased demand for purchases of vacation ownership interests  may increase default rates among current owners and may increase refund requests from our members 
lack of available financing for vacation property developers and consumers or the potential insolvency of developers could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our exchange network membership which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to maintain relationships and renew contractual relationships with vacation ownership developers that provide new members and supply of resort accommodations for use in exchanges or getaways 
our ability to motivate members to renew their existing memberships and or otherwise engage in transactions 
aston the failure of aston to maintain existing hotel and resort management and or rental services arrangements with vacation property owners and or insolvency of several properties managed by or marketed by aston  particularly managed hotels 
a significant decrease in the supply of available vacation rental accommodations due to ongoing property renovations 
recoverability of long lived assets our policy we review the carrying value of all long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
in accordance with guidance included within asc  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset asset group 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and 
table of contents liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when estimating future cash flows  we consider only the future cash flows that were directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  our own assumptions about our use of the asset group and all available evidence when estimating future cash flows  potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions  the existing service potential of the asset asset group at the date tested 
if an asset asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
when determining the fair value of the asset asset group  we consider the highest and best use of the assets from a market participant perspective 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would utilize to price the asset asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
assets to be abandoned  or from which no further benefit is expected  are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
recoverability test as of october   as a consequence of aston failing the step one of the two step process for testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment  we performed a recoverability test on an asset group within our aston reporting unit 
the asset group consisted of aston s property management contracts and wholesaler agreements definite lived intangible assets  certain real estate assets owned by aston and used in the purveyance of revenue generating services pursuant to the aforementioned property management contracts and wholesaler agreements  and aston s tradename definite lived intangible asset 
the resulting recoverability analysis concluded that the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group exceeded its carrying value by an amount greater than of the asset group s carrying value 
accordingly  the asset group was not considered impaired 
the fact that the asset group s cash flows significantly exceeded their carrying amounts in our recoverability test is largely because  pursuant to us gaap  this analysis utilizes an undiscounted cash flow approach 
this method differs from the manner in which the fair value of the asset group is calculated as part of our step two goodwill and other intangibles impairment analysis previously discussed 
our assumptions on key estimates utilized in the recoverability analysis related largely to aston s forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates collectively key estimates 
we believe there is a low to moderate level of uncertainty associated with the assumptions utilized in the development of these key estimates 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the assumptions used in determining the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group  we applied a hypothetical decrease to each of the forecasted key estimates 
this hypothetical decrease would result in the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceeding the asset group s carrying value by approximately 
useful life of the aston asset group additionally  as part of our recoverability analysis  we consider whether the existing service potential useful life of the assets within the aston asset group remain appropriate or require adjustment 
specifically  we consider the impact of the expected use of the assets and the effects of 
table of contents obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  among other considerations 
for the year ended december   and as of the date of our aston recoverability test  we concluded no adjustment was necessary 
when determining the existing service potential of the asset group  we concluded that the weighted average useful life of the asset group was the appropriate measurement period for the analysis 
we reached this conclusion as more than one asset within the asset group shares primary asset attributes due to their interrelated nature  specifically the real estate assets and the property management contracts intangible asset 
aston owns these real estate assets at properties managed by aston and their use is directly joined to aston s ability to perform agreed upon services under the respective property management contracts 
the carrying values of these assets represent approximately of the asset group s total carrying value 
as of october   the weighted average useful life of the asset group was calculated to be years 
the useful lives of the definite lived intangible assets within the asset group are shorter than the weighted average useful life  the largest of which is the property management contracts asset  its carrying value represents approximately of the asset group s total carrying value and has a year remaining useful life 
should we have selected the property management contracts intangible asset as the asset group s primary asset  instead of the weighted average useful life  our conclusion would have been the same 
however  we will reassess in any future recoverability analysis of this asset group  should facts or circumstances change  whether the weighted average useful life remains the most depictive measure of the asset group s remaining economic life 
the carrying value of consolidated long lived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment in accordance with asc is million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize the expense as compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line recognition method 
we grant awards subject to graded vesting ie portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period or to cliff vesting ie all awards vest at the end of the vesting period 
any performance criteria attached to an award subject to graded vesting simply affects whether or not the award will vest 
management must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding stock awards that will ultimately vest  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
the forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods for any changes to the estimated forfeiture rate from that previously estimated 
for any vesting tranche of an award  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award tranche that is actually vested at that date 
actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
as of december   ilg had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  related to all equity based awards  which is currently expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
of the million of unrecognized compensation cost  relates to an employee class group comprised of certain key employees for which we do not expect rsus to be forfeited 
for awards in which we expect forfeitures to occur  a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an impact of less than  to our unrecognized compensation cost as of december  
table of contents income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
pursuant to asc topic income taxes asc formerly known as financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 we adopted a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
see note  income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof

interval s cost of sales decreased primarily due to decreases of million in compensation and other employee related costs  million in the cost of rental inventory for use primarily in getaways and million in call center related expenses 
the decrease in interval s compensation and other employee related costs is due primarily to a decrease of in average operational headcount

goodwill impairment on october   we performed our required annual impairment test and determined there was no impairment with respect to the interval or aston reporting units 
subsequent to the time of our annual impairment test as of october   we determined aston s business climate was experiencing an overall significant adverse change  as evidenced by declines in revpar 
in addition  we noted deteriorating economic conditions during the fourth quarter of as reflected in the declines in risk free interest rates and general market trading multiples  which impacts market capitalization 
ilg s market capitalization over its book value declined during this time period from x to x 
based on these changes  we concluded that this change in business climate could result in a reduction in the fair value of our aston reporting unit below its carrying amount

financial position  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents  including million of us dollar equivalent cash deposits held in foreign jurisdictions  principally the united kingdom which is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested 
additional tax provisions would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the us cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that our cash balances  operating cash flows  and access to our unused million revolving credit facility  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures 
however  our operating cash flow may be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
venezuela operations we conduct business in venezuela where currency restrictions exist limiting our ability to immediately access cash through repatriations at the government s official exchange rate 
our access to these funds remains available for use within this jurisdiction and is not restricted 
during  the process of exchanging venezuelan bolivars to us dollars became increasingly challenging as the government s approval process significantly slowed and became more rigorous 
due to the currency restrictions  a parallel market exists whereby entities can exchange venezuelan bolivars into us dollars through a series of market transactions at a specified  and less favorable  parallel market rate 

table of contents in prior periods  as previously disclosed  we were able to repatriate dividends and certain fees pursuant to intercompany contracts approved by the relevant venezuelan government authorities at the official exchange rate 
however  during the fourth quarter  we received notice that the re approval of these intercompany contracts was denied 
we now do not anticipate repatriating previously requested dividends yet pending approval or un requested dividends  through the country s official exchange process and instead view the parallel exchange market as the more practical method by which to repatriate us dollars 
consequently  at december   we determined the parallel market rate was the appropriate rate to use for translating the financial statements of our venezuelan entity for purposes of consolidation based on the current facts and circumstances of operating in venezuela 
as of december   we had million of us dollar equivalent cash in our venezuelan entity using the official rate 
effective with our change to the parallel market rate at december   we had million of us dollar equivalent cash in our venezuelan entity 
the change to the parallel rate resulted in a net million charge  before tax  recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income within stockholders equity of which million relates specifically to the translation of cash 
as of december   we had million of after tax unrealized loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity pertaining to our venezuela entity until such time we sell or liquidate our investment 
additionally  effective january   venezuela is considered to be highly inflationary 
under us gaap  an economy is considered to be highly inflationary when the three year cumulative rate of inflation meets or exceeds 
under the highly inflationary basis of accounting  the financial statements of our venezuelan entity will be remeasured as if its functional currency were the reporting currency u 
s dollars  with remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings  rather than in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income within our stockholders equity 
consequently  because we have decided to adopt the parallel market rate  which is subject to market fluctuation  and because our venezuelan entity operates in a highly inflationary economy  future remeasurements could increase the volatility of our results of operations 
we are currently evaluating our options regarding our operations in venezuela  including closure of the office  to address these aforementioned considerations and the increasing challenges of physically operating in venezuela 
effective january   the official exchange rate was devalued from to bolivars to the us dollar 
at the date of the devaluation  the parallel rate changed from to bolivars to the us dollar 
because of our change to the parallel market rate  the official exchange rate devaluation had no impact to our consolidated financials statements

there have been no borrowings under the revolver through december  in addition  on august   interval acquisition corp 
issued to iac million of aggregate principal amounts of senior notes due the interval senior notes  reduced by the original issue discount of million of which million remains unamortized at december   and iac exchanged such notes for certain of iac s senior notes  pursuant to a notes exchange and consent agreement 
the secured credit facility effectively ranks prior to the interval senior notes to the extent of the value of the assets that secure it 
the interval senior notes and senior secured credit facility have various financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to incur additional liens  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  make loans and investments  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person 
the senior secured credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants  requiring the maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated debt over consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement through december   from january  through december  and thereafter  and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda over consolidated interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement through december  and thereafter 
in addition  we may be required to use a portion of our consolidated excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement to prepay the senior secured credit facility based on our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal year commencing with december  if our consolidated leverage ratio equals or exceeds  we must prepay of consolidated excess cash flow  if our consolidated leverage ratio equals or exceeds but is less than  we must prepay of consolidated excess cash flow  and if our consolidated leverage ratio is less than  then no prepayment is required 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable financial and operating covenants and our consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio under the credit agreement were and  respectively 
we have funding commitments that could potentially require our performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events 
at december   guarantees  surety bonds and letters of credit totaled million 
guarantees represent million of this total and primarily relate to aston s hotel and resort management agreements  including those with guaranteed dollar amounts  and accommodation leases supporting the management activities  entered into on behalf of the property owners for which either party may terminate such leases upon days prior written notice to each other 
in addition  certain of aston s hotel and resort management agreements provide that owners receive specified percentages of the revenue generated under aston management 
in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operation are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages  and aston either retains the balance if 
table of contents any as its management fee or makes up the deficit 
although such deficits are reasonably possible in a few of these agreements  amounts are not expected to be significant 
we anticipate that we will make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of our operations 
our ability to fund our cash and capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations  the overall capacity and terms of our financing arrangements as discussed above  and access to the capital markets

our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from our segments  excluding the effects of any non cash expenses 
we also believe this non gaap financial measure improves the transparency of our disclosures  provides a meaningful presentation of our results from our business operations  excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improves the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statement of operations of certain expenses  including non cash compensation 
we endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non gaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items  including quantifying such items  to derive the non gaap measure 
we report ebitda as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated 
we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 
we provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non gaap measure which are discussed below 
constant currency represents current period results of operations determined by translating our functional currency results to us dollars our reporting currency using the actual prior year blended rate of translation from the comparable prior period 
we believe that this measure improves the period to period comparability of results from business operations as it eliminates the effect of foreign currency translation 
pro forma results we will only present ebitda on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature 
for the periods presented in this report  there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 
non cash expenses that are excluded from ilg s non gaap measure non cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants  including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions  of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
these expenses are not paid in cash  and we will include the related shares in our future calculations of diluted shares of stock outstanding 
upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the 
table of contents exercise of certain stock options  the awards will be settled  at our discretion  on a net basis  with us remitting the required tax withholding amount from our current funds 
goodwill and asset impairments is a non cash expense relating to adjustments to goodwill and long lived assets whereby the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the related assets  and is infrequent in nature 
amortization expense of intangibles is a non cash expense relating primarily to acquisitions 
at the time of an acquisition  the intangible assets of the acquired company  such as customer relationships  purchase agreements and resort management agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives 
we believe that since intangibles represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition  they were part of transaction costs 
depreciation expense is a non cash expense relating to our property and equipment and does not relate to our core business operations 
depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the united kingdom and the european union 
our foreign currency risk primarily relates to our investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this exposure is mitigated as we have generally reinvested profits in our international operations 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally 
non operating foreign exchange net loss for the year ended december  was million and net gain for the year ended december  was million attributable to cash held in certain countries in currencies other than their local currency 
this was principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  and affected by the shift in the value of the dollar to the british pound  mexican peso  and colombian peso 

table of contents as we increase our operations in international markets we become increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing  operating and hedging strategies 
a hypothetical weakening strengthening in foreign exchange rates to the united states dollar at december  would result in an approximate change to revenue of million 
there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures between the current and preceding fiscal years 
interest rate risk at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan facility 
based on the amount outstanding  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of million 
additionally  at december   we had million face amount of interval senior notes that bear interest at a fixed amount 
if market rates decline  we run the risk that the required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates 
based on our mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt and cash balances  we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure 
there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures between the current and preceding fiscal years
