liquidity and capital resources history and background from february when our ipo occurred through fiscal  inclusive  we have raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock 
the demand for our optical products has decreased overtime 
however  despite the downturn in the optical products market  we believe that some improvement has occurred in recent fiscal years with respect to the demand for our products in several of our other markets  particularly the precision molded optics for laser tools and infrared optics for fire safety 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal or as shown in the accompanying financial statements  the company has incurred recurring losses from operations and as of june  the company has an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
cash used in operations was  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
management has instituted cost reductions which included a reduction in labor  material costs and discretionary expense spending 
in addition  we have redesigned certain product lines collimators and precision molded optics  increased sales prices on gradium products  obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in china  and have instituted more efficient management techniques which have improved our product yields 
man agement believes these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability  assuming we meet out sales targets 
management has developed an operating plan for fiscal and believes the company has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan and to sustain its current operations in the coming year 
nevertheless  management will be monitoring the plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year  remedial actions will be 
table of contents initiated 
the company had a cash balance of approximately  at june  during fiscal  the company raised approximately million from the sale of common stock and warrants 
the company may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable  however  the company may be required to seek external financing regardless of whether the terms would otherwise be acceptable if the company s financial resources are not sufficient to sustain its operations or to pursue its business plan 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily in the infrared products and the low cost high volume products  such as laser tools  for the imaging markets in asia 
we have been targeting these markets since fiscal we expect margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs as a result of the shifting of our manufacturing operations to shanghai  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
however  there is no assurance we will be able to achieve the necessary sales growth and gross margin improvements to sustain operations 
factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include  but are not limited to  a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sa les growth  increased material costs  increased labor costs  planned production efficiency improvements not being realized  increases in property  casualty  benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending  particularly sales and marketing related 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern 
we have taken certain actions to conserve our cash including extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers 
we have negotiated payment plans with some key vendors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we delayed payments to one of our secured note holders  however as of june  all payments which were past due have been paid and we have paid all amounts due on the notes 
in march the orlando staff was reduced to a four day work week 
increased sales allowed us to return to a five day work week in november this reduced work week resulted in savings of  in fiscal in wages and benefits 
in addition  we have redesigned certain product lines collimators and precision molded optics  increased sales prices on gradium products  obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in china  and have instituted more efficient management techniques which have improved our product yields 
we believe these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability assuming we meet our sales targets 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are una ble to continue as a going concern 
starting in january we faced financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with  as the worldwide economic instability continued to create turbulence in the market 
we engaged in continuing efforts to keep costs under control as we sought renewed sales growth 
our efforts were directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability 
if these efforts are not successful  we will need to raise additional capital 
should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms  other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales 
these actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company  the sale of certain product lines  the creation of joint venture s or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities  the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology  or other alternatives 
on september   the company had a book cash balance of approximately  we execute all foreign sales from our orlando facility and inter company transactions in us dollars  mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities denominated in non us currencies  primarily the chinese renminbi  are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date  and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year 
during the years ended june  and we incurred a  loss and a  gain on foreign currency translation  respectively 
cash flows recent financings in fiscal we had a convertible debenture offering with twenty four institutional and private investors 
on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with respect to the private placement of senior convertible debentures the debentures 
the debentures are secured by substantially all of our previously unencumbered assets pursuant to a security agreement and are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries  geltech inc and lightpath optical instrumentation shanghai co  ltd pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee 
the sale of the debentures generated gross proceeds of approximately  and net proceeds of  we used the funds to provide working capital for our operations 
among the investors were steven brueck  j 
james gaynor  louis leebu rg  robert ripp  gary silverman and james magos  all of whom were directors or officers of lightpath as of august  mr 
magos resigned effective september  the maturity date of the debentures is august   on which date the outstanding principal amount of the debentures will be due 
interest of  was due on october  and was prepaid by the company on august  
table of contents by issuing  shares of class a common stock  par value the common stock in payment of such interest based upon the closing price of per share 
the remaining interest on the debentures was prepaid by issuing common stock in december upon issuance  the debentures were immediately convertible into  shares of common stock  based on a conversion price of per share  which was of the closing bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  with of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share and the remaining of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share 
if all of the warrants were exercised at that time  we would have received additional proceeds in the amount of  investors who participated in our july common stock private placement were offered an incentive to invest in the convertible debenture offering 
four investors from the july offering participated in the convertible debenture offering and as a result we reduced the exercise price of the warrants they received in the july offering from per share to per share 
the reduced exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants from the july offering by  to  additionally  such investors were issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock the incentive shares  valued at we paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the convertible debenture offering  first montauk securities corp 
first montauk  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to first montauk and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which was of the closing bid price of the our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  in addition  the exercise price of of the warrants previously issued to the first montauk and its designees at the closing of the july offering was reduced from to per share 
this reduced warrant exercise price lowered potenti al proceeds on the exercise of the warrants issued to first montauk from the july offering by  to  the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the act  pursuant to section of the act in that we sold the debentures  warrants and incentive shares in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the shares into which the debentures are convertible  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and the incentive shares have been registered for resale under the act 
the registration statement was declared effective on october  the warrants and the incentive shares issued to the debenture holders were valued at  and recorded as a discount on the debt 
the incentive shares were valued using the fair market value of our stock on the date of issuance 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes valuation model using assumptions similar to those used to value our stock options and rsus 
in addition a beneficial conversion feature associated with the debentures was valued at  and was recorded as a discount on the debt 
the total debt discount of  will be amortized using the effective interest method over the month term of the debentures 
on december  the debentures were amended to allow debenture holders to convert of their debentures into common stock 
as a result   of the debentures were converted into  shares of common stock 
as an inducement to convert the debentures  we issued additional warrants valued at  using the black scholes method and prepaid the interest of  on the unconverted portion of the debentures through the maturity date of august   which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
interest payment of  for the quarter ended december  resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as a result of the debenture conversion   of debt discount was written off to interest expense 
during the year end ed june    of the debt discount was amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations and the remaining unamortized debt discount was  at june  this included the write off of debt issuance costs  prepaid interest and debt discount for the conversion of  of the debentures into shares of common stock during fiscal on may  we filed a registration statement to register those additional interest shares and warrants which were issued in december the registration statement was declared effective on june  we also incurred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the debentures of  is being amortized over the month term using the effective interest method 
the costs were for broker commissions  legal and accounting fees  filing fees and  representing the fair value of the  warrants shares issued to first montauk 
we used the black scholes model to determine fair value of the warrants 
the warrants carry a five year term  expiring on august   and are immediately exercisable at a per share price of for one third of the 
table of contents warrants and for two thirds of the warrants 
as of june    of the debt issuance costs included in the debt discount were amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations and the remaining unamortized balance was  total principal outstanding on the debentures and the principal amount outstanding for directors and officers purchases under the debentures was  and  respectively at june   less unamortized debt discount of  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we completed two private placement offerings with certain institutional and private investors 
on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with thirty three investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share the august warrants

the registration statement was declared effective on may  cash flows operating and investing cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal we anticipate lower glass costs by replacing an internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes which are expected to improve our cash flow in future years 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash provided by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal cost cutting measures were implemented in fiscal and but revenues were not high enough to cover fixed costs 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 

table of contents during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tooling for our precision molded products 
the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tenant improvements due to the relocation of our shanghai facility 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at increased levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
results of operations operating results for fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes for precision molded optics and gradium lenses offset by lower sales for isolators and collimators 
our precision molded optics sales units were significantly higher but our average selling price was lower 
this is the result of our pursuit of producing high volume low cost lenses 
in our operating plan for fiscal we expect to see revenue gains in aspheric lenses and infrared lenses while collimators  gradium lenses and isolator sales are expected to remain at current levels 
we expect significant mix change in our revenue number in fiscal as we increase the volume of low cost lenses sold and continue to transform the company into a high volume molded optical manufacturer 
we anticipate our growth in fiscal will come from the laser tool market which includes gun sights 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is a decrease over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this percentage decrease was caused by several factors 
among them  during the year we were successful in shifting over of production of molded optics to our shanghai facility  reduced materials cost by incorporating lower cost glass into our products  had better production yields and efficiencies and manufactured lens holders in house at a reduced cost  all of which we anticipate will result in continued improvements to our margins 
these cost reductions have lowered our cost structure and enabled us to bid on the high volume low cost business 
lower revenues were not sufficient to absorb our fixed costs and overh ead costs 
our two plants combined capacity usage moved from of capacity to of capacity during fiscal our plant capacity and overhead structure are sufficient to handle much higher levels of production 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in china of raw materials and coating services and higher yields due to a more experienced workforce at the shanghai facility 
over the course of fiscal  as we focused on new product development  we increased our headcount in orlando from to we continue to product over of our precision molded optics production in our shanghai facility 
precision molded optics comprises of our total revenue and with the majority of the manufacturing at the shanghai facility our gross margin has improved to from 
we also transferred complete manufacturing of our isolator products to our shanghai facility in the last half of fiscal we our gross margin will continue to improve as we have not yet seen the full year impact of this transfer 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we had a reduction of  due to lower salaries and benefits  a  reduction of board compensation and a decreased legal costs of  we had higher investor relations expenses of  for our new radio and television campaign during fiscal during fiscal there were some one time events resulting in a net reduction of approximately  in general and administrative expenses  receipt of  on our d o insurance as a refund for legal expenses  a litigation settlement   reduction of legal expenses related to the reversal of accruals for litigation and reduction for reversal of royalty accrual of approximately  in the fourth qu arter of fiscal there were two one time events resulting in reductions to general and administrative expenses  receipt of  from our d o insurance carrier as a refund of legal expenses and receipt of  from the chinese government related to the move of our manufacturing facility in shanghai 
our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we support a higher level of sales 
we plan to manage the orlando workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal decreased by approximately  to approximately  this decrease was primarily due to decreased product development materials offset by higher labor costs 
our operating plan for fiscal projects that product development spending will increase due to enhanced efforts in the development of the infrared product line 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately  and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal 
table of contents interest expense decreased by approximately  to approximately  compared to approximately million in fiscal this is primarily due to the conversion of of the convertible debentures in december and related write off of unamortized debt discount and debt costs and interest related to the fair value of warrants issued to induce conversion 
investment and other income decreased by approximately  to  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  due to a decrease in interest earned on lower cash balances and lower royalty fees earned 
net loss for fiscal was approximately  compared with approximately million in fiscal  a decline of approximately million 
this improvement in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin improvement of million primarily due to increased revenues  reduced salaries and benefits and better utilization of fixed costs  better production yields and lower material costs  reduced sg a salaries and benefits of  decreased interest expense of  due to write off of debt discount and debt costs on debentures for the conversion of debentures in december  and the net of  for one time items for d o insurance claims  legal settlement expenses  and the reversal of accruals for royalty payments and litigation expenses  and a gain on the move of the shanghai facility 
key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
this is followed by sampling small numbers of the product for the customer s test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win wh ether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the 
table of contents business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial productio n indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
the discussions of our results as presented in this annual report include use of the non gaap terms ebitda and gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor  materials  services  fixed costs for rent  utilities and depreciation  and variable overhead 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap financial measure is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates our cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses 
we use gross margin in measuri ng the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  ebitda  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for us 
disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q our disclosure backlog at june  was approximately million 
due to market conditions  throughout fiscal new orders were lower than the previous year 
in fiscal and we debooked some orders due to customer cancellations and new bookings were at a lower level than shipments causing the year end backlog to decrease 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we debooked orders to two large customers  one due to non payment and one due to their customer cancellation 
we are currently working on replacing this lost business 
we believe our backlog will grow as a result of our efforts to enter high volume lower cost commercial markets  including the industrial laser tool market and other imaging related product markets 
we have seen increased quote activity for our black diamond product line and our new blue lenses 
with the continuing diversification of our backlog we expect to show modest increases in revenue starting in the second quarter of we have experienced an increase in bookings for our industrial low 
table of contents cost lenses in asia 
we are now in production on these large orders of industrial low cost lenses and have started shipping product to customers 
we project continued production and shipment for these low cost lenses 
ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by management  lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation s financial position and core operating performance 
investors sometimes use ebitda as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization 
ebitda also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables  inventory and payables  which can also indicate a significant need for  or source of  cash 
since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow  ebitda is not a good indicator of a business s cash flows 
we use ebitda for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the company s core operations and for planning purposes 
we calculate ebitda by adjusting net loss to exclude net interest expense  income tax expense or benefit  depreciation and amortization  thus the term earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and the acronym ebitda 
our ebitda as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended ebitda q q q q q q inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
we review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capi tal 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average in comparison  our days cost of sales in inventory for the year ended june  was  compared to for the year ended june  we believe this upward trend in inventory was principally caused by increasing stock in the infrared product line 
we expect inventory levels to decline through fiscal as we continue to reduce costs 

table of contents accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
weekly we review all receivables that are sixty days past terms 
these past due accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by 
generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average our days sales outstanding for the year ended june  was compared to at june  we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible 
we strive to have dso no higher than we have noticed an increase in dso as of our quarterly revenue was shipped in the last month of the quarter and therefore revenues have yet not been collected 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves for obsolesense  revenue recognition  valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a ch ange in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable  is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over days past due from due date and of the total of invoices that are over days past due from due date 
accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
the company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected 
if the company s actual collection experience changes  revisions to its allowance may be required 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receiv able is written off against the allowance 
inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished lenses  isolators  collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
inventory costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
acquisition of goods from our vendors has a purchase burden added to cover shipping and handling costs 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed 
the inventory obsolescence reserve is calculated by reserving for items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply  as well as reserving for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last twelve months and reserving for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months 
revenue is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer  provided that the company has received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones 
table of contents are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products  reports or designs to the customer 
invoice amounts for sales or vat taxes are posted to the balance sheet and not included in revenue 
stock based compensation is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant using the black scholes merton pricing model 
most options granted under our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan vest ratably over two to four years and generally have ten year contract lives 
the volatility rate is based on four year historical trends in common stock closing prices and the expected term was determined based primarily on historical experience of previously outstanding options 
the interest rate used is the us treasury interest rate for constant maturities 
the likelihood of meeting tar gets for option grants that are performance based are evaluated each quarter 
if it is determined that meeting the targets is probable then the compensation expense will be amortized over the remaining vesting period 
derivative financial instruments 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with fasb asc  derivatives and hedging formerly referenced as sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
asc  which requires additional disclosures about the company s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments  how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how the derivative instruments and related hedging items affect the financial statements 
the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow  market or foreign currency risk 
terms of convertible debt instruments are reviewed to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under asc to be accounted for separately from the host contract  and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
