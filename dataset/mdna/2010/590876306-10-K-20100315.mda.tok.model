the company currently projects that it will be required to contribute  to its pension and defined contribution plans during the fiscal year ending january  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting guidance codified in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc topic provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of the fair value measurements on earnings 
as a part of the framework for measuring fair value  this guidance establishes a hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs used in valuation in which there is little market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
asc topic applies whenever other guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
asc topic is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and was adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued accounting guidance codified in asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
asc topic requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans the plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
asc topic also requires us to measure the funded status of the plans as of the year end consolidated balance sheet date  effective for fiscal years ending after december  the impact of adopting this guidance resulted in an increase in the pension liabilities and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  prior to any deferred tax adjustment  in the fiscal year ended january   and a decrease in pension liabilities and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  prior to any deferred tax adjustment  in the fiscal year ended january  in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance codified in asc topic  business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
asc topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the 
index capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
with respect to the company  asc topic applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after february  we expect asc topic will have an impact on accounting for future acquisitions by the company 
in march  the fasb issued accounting guidance codified in asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
the march guidance requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments  and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
asc topic is effective for the company beginning february  asc topic did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance codified in asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
the codification reorganizes the thousands of us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics and displays all topics in a consistent structure 
the codification also supersedes all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  staff positions  or eitf abstracts  instead it will issue accounting standards updates asu 
the fasb will not consider asus as authoritative in their own right 
asus will serve only to update the codification  provide information on guidance and bases for conclusions on change s in the codification 
the provisions of asc topic are effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and  accordingly  are effective for the company for the current fiscal reporting period 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  an amendment of asc topic revenue recognition 
asu no 
provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of these amendments  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing us gaap 
the asu does this by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
a vendor will be required to determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
this asu also eliminates the residual method of allocation and will require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  which allocates any discount in the overall arrangement proportionally to each deliverable based on its relative selling price 
expanded disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information regarding application of the multiple deliverable revenue arrangement guidance are also required under the asu 
the asu does not apply to arrangements for which industry specific allocation and measurement guidance exists  such as long term construction contracts and software transactions 
asu no 
is effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning february  the company is currently evaluating the impact asu no 
will have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
fasb asc topic  revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with fasb asc topic 
index depreciation and amortization property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill  the company s unamortized goodwill balance is being assessed  at least annually  for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test for each reporting unit using a fair value approach 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which comprise our operating segments 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method  we rely on a number of assumptions including sales and related gross margin projections  operating margins  anticipated working capital requirements and market rate of returns used in discounting projected cash flows 
these assumptions were based upon market and industries outlooks  our business plans and historical data 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital applicable to the company 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis on each of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill on their balance sheets 
in each case  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by a significant amount  except for flex kleen which represents of the total company wide goodwill 
for flex kleen  the carrying value as of january  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the fair value of flex kleen as of january  and totaled million and million  respectively 
as a result  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by million and million at january  and  respectively 
therefore  as of january   flex kleen s goodwill was not impaired 
flex kleen  which initially performed well after being acquired in  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january   and in the fiscal years ended january   and  the actual results exceeded the projected results used in our impairment model 
in the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales and operating profit were below the projections in our impairment model  which we believe is a reflection of the downturn in global business and economic conditions during this period of time and is not due to any new development specific to flex kleen 
flex kleen s business must improve in the fiscal year ending january  in order for us to avoid an impairment charge 
because of market conditions and or potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
based on current projections  a one percent decrease in revenue growth  a one percent decrease in gross margin or a one percent increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value for flex kleen by million  million  and million  respectively 
additionally  the company cannot predict the occurrence of unknown events that might adversely affect the reportable value of its goodwill 
pension obligations the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 

index forward looking statements  factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements may be identified by words describing our belief or expectation  such as where we say that we believe  expect or anticipate  or where we characterize something in a manner in which there is an express or implicit reference to the future  such as non recurring or unusual  or where we express that our view is based upon the current status of a given matter  or upon facts as we know them as of the date of the statement 
the content and or context of other statements that we make may indicate that the statement is forward looking 
we claim the safe harbor provided by the private securities reform act of for all forward looking statements 
results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events  other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in met pro s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could affect our future financial condition and results of operations  and could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in our sec filings and in our forward looking statements the write down of goodwill  as a result of the determination that the acquired business is impaired 
flex kleen  which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january    and in the fiscal year ended january   flex kleen s net sales and operating profit were below the projections in our impairment model  which we believe is a reflection of the downturn in global business and economic conditions during this period of time and is not due to any new development specific to flex kleen 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis of the million of goodwill that the company carries for flex kleen and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
flex kleen s business must improve in the fiscal year ended january  in order for us to avoid an impairment charge 
we anticipate that flex kleen s performance during the fiscal year beginning february  will be at a level that will not indicate impairment of its goodwill  but this expectation is a forward looking statement where the actual results may not be as we presently anticipate  materially adverse changes in economic conditions i in the markets served by us or ii in significant customers of ours  material changes in available technology  adverse developments in the asbestos cases that have been filed against the company  including without limitation the exhaustion of insurance coverage  the imposition of punitive damages or other adverse developments in the availability of insurance coverage  changes in accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  the cost of compliance with sarbanes oxley and other applicable legal and listing requirements  and the unanticipated possibility that met pro may not meet these requirements  weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which either alone or combined with actions by our employees intended to circumvent our internal control over financial reporting  to violate our policies  or to commit fraud or other bad acts  could lead to incorrect reporting of financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for met pro corporation  these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes 
the carrying value of the company s total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt  at january  was million 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at january  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to either the libor or euribor market rates  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company has only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the company has one interest rate swap agreement to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates 
effective april   the company entered into a fifteen year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the bond payable maturing april the company swapped the ninety day libor for a fixed rate of 
as of january  the effective fixed interest rate was as a result of the swap agreement plus the interest rate floor provision of basis points 
the interest rate swap agreement is accounted for as a fair value hedge that qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness in accordance with fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of january  the interest rate swap agreement is considered a level fair value measurement  and because of the short cut method of asc topic used to record the fair value of the interest rate swap  the company believes it is more practicable to describe the activity in narrative form 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement resulted in a decrease in equity of  net of tax and  net of tax at january  and  respectively 
these results are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of shareholders equity 
see note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the netherlands  canada and the people s republic of china 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the limited size of our foreign operations  however  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the fiscal year ending january
