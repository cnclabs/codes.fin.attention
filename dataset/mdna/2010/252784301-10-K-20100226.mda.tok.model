item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained in our sec filings 
overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that  as of february   owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts that contain approximately  guestrooms 
we are an owner  as opposed to an operator  of hotels 
as an owner  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels  after we pay fees to the hotel manager  which are based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels 
our vision is to be the premier allocator of capital in the lodging industry 
our mission is to deliver long term shareholder returns through a combination of dividends and long term capital appreciation 
our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation and focus on acquiring  owning  and measured recycling of high quality  branded lodging properties in north america with superior long term growth prospects and high barrier to entry for new supply 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of our platform by being open and transparent in our communications with investors  monitoring our corporate overhead and following sound corporate governance practices 
consistent with our strategy  we continue to focus on opportunistically investing in premium full service hotels and  to a lesser extent  premium urban limited service hotels located throughout north america 
our portfolio of hotels is concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations and are all operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies marriott international  inc marriott  starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood or hilton worldwide hilton 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality and destination resort focused branded real estate we own premium hotels and resorts in north america 
these hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resort locations such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that gateway cities and destination resorts will achieve higher long term growth because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry  expensive construction costs and limited prime hotel development sites 
we believe that higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
in addition  a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage global hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful global brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
dominant global hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top global lodging brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but two of our hotels are managed by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in owning hotels that are currently operated under  or can be converted to  a globally recognized brand 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been committed to a flexible capital structure with prudent leverage 
during though early  we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by fixing our interest rates for an extended period of time 
moreover  during the peak years and in the commercial real estate market  we maintained low financial leverage by funding several of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
this capital markets strategy allowed us to maintain a balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt as the lodging cycle began to decline 
during the peak years  we believed  and present events have confirmed  that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
we have always strived to operate our business with prudent leverage 
our corporate goals and objectives for  a year that experienced a significant industry downturn  were focused on preserving and enhancing our liquidity 
based on a comprehensive action plan  we took a number of steps to achieve that goal  as follows we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock during the second quarter of the net proceeds to us  after deduction of offering costs  were approximately million 
we initiated two separate million controlled equity offering programs  raising net proceeds as of december  of million through the sale of million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
we repaid the entire million outstanding on our senior unsecured credit facility during as of december   we have no outstanding borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility 
we refinanced the mortgage on our courtyard manhattan midtown east hotel with a million secured loan from massachusetts mutual life insurance company  which matures on october  we repaid the million loan secured by the griffin gate marriott with corporate cash during the fourth quarter of the loan was scheduled to mature on january  we repaid the million loan secured by the bethesda marriott suites with corporate cash during the fourth quarter of the mortgage debt was scheduled to mature in july we paid of our dividend in shares of our common stock  as permitted by the internal revenue service s revenue procedure  as amplified and superseded by revenue procedure  which preserved million of corporate cash 
we focused on minimizing capital spending during our capital expenditures were million  of which only million was funded from corporate cash and the balance funded from escrow reserves 
as a result of the steps listed above  we achieved our goal to preserve and enhance our liquidity and decreased our net debt by percent in as of december   we have million of unrestricted corporate cash 
we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no maturities until the fourth quarter of as of december   we have million of mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of over years 
in addition  we currently have ten hotels unencumbered by debt and no corporate level debt outstanding 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management team s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has an established broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
in the current economic environment  we believe that our extensive lodging experience  our network of industry relationships and our asset management strategies position us to minimize the impact of declining revenues on our hotels 
in particular  we are focused on controlling our property level and corporate expenses  as well as working closely with our managers to optimize the mix of business at our hotels in order to maximize potential revenue 
our property level cost containment efforts include the implementation of aggressive contingency plans at each of our hotels 
the contingency plans include controlling labor expenses  eliminating hotel staff positions  adjusting food and beverage outlet hours of operation and not filling open positions 
in addition  our strategy to significantly renovate many of the hotels in our portfolio from to resulted in the flexibility to significantly curtail our planned capital expenditures for and we use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the regulations governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor through one of our subsidiaries to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with the managers of our hotels in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  average daily rate or adr  revenue per available room or revpar  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance are dependent on the continued success of our hotel managers and the brands we have licensed 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business

overview of results and outlook for the impact of the severe economic recession on us travel fundamentals and our operating results is likely to persist for some period of time 
lodging demand has historically correlated with several key economic indicators such as gdp growth  employment trends  corporate profits  consumer confidence and business investment 
although there have been recent signs that occupancy in the industry may have stabilized  average daily rates have continued to decline 
despite the occupancy stabilization  the shift from traditionally high rated business transient customers to leisure customers has significantly impacted the profitability of our hotels 
we don t anticipate a significant improvement in lodging fundamentals until our business mix improves 
we expect lodging demand to follow its historical course and lag the general economic recovery by several quarters and thus  we anticipate a challenging operating environment into the recession has resulted in reduced travel as well as a heightened focus on reducing the cost of travel 
during  the impact resulted in a significant decline in adr at our hotels and a more moderate decline in occupancy 
we expect revpar to decline in  primarily as a result of declining adr 
we are working closely with our hotel managers at our hotels to control our operating costs 
however  certain of our cost categories are increasing at a rate greater than the current rate of inflation  including wages  benefits  utilities and real estate taxes 
the combination of declining revenues and increasing operating costs will impact our operating results throughout new hotel supply remains a short term negative and a long term positive 
although the industry benefited from supply growth less than historical averages from to  new hotel supply began to increase at the end of the last economic expansion 
while some of those projects have been delayed or eliminated  the rate of new supply is expected to approximate historical averages in for our portfolio 
we have been or will be impacted by new supply in a few of our markets  most notably chicago and austin in due to a number of factors  we expect below average supply growth for an extended period of time beginning in  when we expect minimal new supply coupled with demand recovery to be a significant positive for operating fundamentals

revenues consist primarily of the room  food and beverage and other revenues from our hotels 
revenues for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  change rooms food and beverage other total revenues individual hotel revenues for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in millions year ended december  change chicago marriott westin boston waterfront hotel frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort los angeles airport marriott renaissance waverly hotel conrad chicago renaissance austin hotel oak brook hills marriott resort marriott griffin gate resort renaissance worthington courtyard manhattan midtown east torrance marriott south bay vail marriott mountain resort spa salt lake city marriott downtown the lodge at sonoma  a renaissance resort spa orlando airport marriott westin atlanta north at perimeter courtyard manhattan fifth avenue bethesda marriott suites marriott atlanta alpharetta total our total revenues decreased percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a percent decline in revpar  driven by a percent decrease in adr and a percentage point decrease in occupancy  as well as lower food and beverage and other revenue 
all of our hotels experienced revenue declines for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the economic recession on all of our markets 
the following are the key hotel operating statistics for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  change occupancy percentage points adr revpar our revpar declined for the year ended december  most of the decline in revpar can be attributed to a significant decline in the average daily rate and reflect a number of negative trends within our primary customer segments  as well as a change in mix between those segments 
our room revenue by primary customer segment for the years ended december  and was as follows year ended year ended december  december  in millions of total in millions of total business transient group leisure and other total within the business transient segment  traditionally the most profitable segment for hotels  room revenue at our hotels declined almost in on a decrease in room nights and an decrease in average rate 
the declines in business transient revenue moderated to during the fourth quarter  the lowest level of decline during the year 
we expect the business transient segment to remain depressed until there is a sustained improvement in the overall economic climate in the united states 
business transient room revenue was partially replaced by lower rated leisure and other business 
although leisure and other revenue declined during by almost  room nights increased by over 
in response to the current economic climate  a number of groups postponed  cancelled or reduced their meetings in as a result  our group room revenue declined on a decline in group room nights 
group business is not demonstrating the same moderating trends as business transient  as it was down during the fourth quarter  but the group booking window remains very short 
this effect was illustrated during the fourth quarter when our hotels booked  net of cancellations  more group rooms than during the fourth quarter as of december   our group booking pace is approximately lower than as the same time last year 
food and beverage revenues decreased from the year ended december   reflecting a decline in both banquet and outlet revenues 
other revenues  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking and attrition and cancellation fee  decreased from the year ended december  hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of operating expenses of our hotels  including non cash ground rent expense 
the operating expenses for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in millions year ended december  change rooms departmental expenses food and beverage departmental expenses other departmental expenses general and administrative utilities repairs and maintenance sales and marketing base management fees incentive management fees property taxes ground rent contractual ground rent non cash total hotel operating expenses our hotel operating expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our operating expenses  which consist of both fixed and variable costs  are primarily impacted by changes in occupancy  inflation and revenues  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
we have been working with our hotel managers to lower operating expenses given the significant declines in revenues 
as a result of those cost containment measures  and an overall decline in occupancy  we have reduced the rooms  food and beverage and other hotel departmental expenses 
the primary driver for the decrease in these operating expenses is an overall decline in wages and benefits 
property taxes were the only expense category to increase in  primarily due to our westin boston waterfront hotel  which is subject to payments in lieu of property taxes based on a ramping percentage of hotel revenues until management fees are calculated as a percentage of revenues  as well as a percentage of operating profit at certain hotels 
as such  the decline in base management fees is due to the overall decline in revenues at our hotels 
we only pay incentive management fees at certain of our hotels when operating profits are above certain thresholds 
the decrease in incentive management fees of approximately million is due to the decline in operating profits at those hotels as well as a number of our hotels falling below the operating profit thresholds in compared to in  we had eight hotels earn incentive management fees as compared to two hotels in impairment of favorable lease asset 
we recorded impairment losses of million and million on the favorable leasehold asset related to our option to develop a hotel on an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the westin boston waterfront hotel during and  respectively 
since our acquisition of the hotel in  the fair market value of this option declined from million to million as of december  depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the full year impact of increased capital expenditures in  primarily consisting of the significant capital projects at the chicago marriott and the westin boston waterfront hotel 
depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over years for the periods subsequent to acquisition 
depreciable lives of hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment will be replaced 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses principally consisted of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock 
corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs  professional fees and directors fees 
our corporate expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is principally due to two management changes during that resulted in a million charge 
first  our executive chairman  william w 
mccarten  announced his intention to retire as of december  and continue as the non executive chairman of the board in in connection with this change  our board of directors granted mr 
mccarten eligible retiree status and we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million to accelerate unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
secondly  our executive vice president and general counsel  michael d 
schecter  was terminated in december and as a result  we recorded a non recurring charge of million 
the remainder of the increase in corporate expenses is attributable to higher stock based compensation expense in interest expense 
our interest expense totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the increase in interest expense is due primarily to million of default interest recorded as a result of the event of default on the frenchman s reef mortgage  which was partially offset by the repayment of amounts outstanding on our credit facility and the repayment of the mortgages on two of our hotels in our interest expense was comprised of interest on our mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and interest and unused facility fees on our credit facility million 
as of december   we had property specific mortgage debt outstanding on ten of our hotels 
on all of the hotels we have fixed rate secured debt  which bears interest at rates ranging from to per year 
amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate that fluctuates based on the level of outstanding indebtedness in relation to the value of our assets from time to time 
we did not have any draws on the credit facility as of december  our weighted average interest rate on all debt as of december  was 
interest income 
our interest income decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although our corporate cash balances are higher in  the interest rates earned on our corporate cash were significantly lower than the rates earned in income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  based on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december  and the million pre tax loss of the taxable reit subsidiary that owns the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net income for the year ended december  was million 
we did not acquire any hotels during the year ended december  and acquired one hotel during the year ended december  accordingly  the current period results are not comparable to the results for the corresponding period in revenues 
revenues consisted primarily of the room  food and beverage and other revenues from our hotels 
revenues for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  change rooms food and beverage other total revenues the following are the pro forma key hotel operating statistics for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the pro forma hotel operating statistics presented below include the results of operations of the westin boston waterfront hotel under previous ownership for the period from january  to january  year ended december  change occupancy percentage points adr revpar our total revenues decreased percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a percent decline in revpar  driven by a percent decrease in adr and a percentage point decrease in occupancy  as well as lower food and beverage revenue 
nearly all of our hotels experienced revenue declines for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the current recession on all of our markets 
the negative trends accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter of in addition  revenue at the chicago marriott was adversely impacted by a major renovation in the first half of hotel operating expenses 
our hotel operating expenses from continuing operations totaled million for the year ended december  hotel operating expenses consisted primarily of operating expenses of our hotels  including approximately million of non cash ground rent expense

the increase from is primarily attributable to an increase in departmental and other operating expenses due to higher wages and benefits and higher energy costs at our hotels 
in addition  benefited from million in yield support being recognized 
the increase is partially offset by lower base and incentive management fees due to lower revenues and operating profits in impairment of favorable lease asset 
we recorded an impairment loss of million on the favorable leasehold asset related to our option to develop a hotel on an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the westin boston waterfront hotel during the fair market value of this option declined from million to million as of december  depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased capital expenditures in  primarily consisting of the significant capital projects at the chicago marriott and the westin boston waterfront hotel

corporate expenses 
corporate expenses principally consisted of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock 
corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs  professional fees and directors fees 
our corporate expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation  payroll and professional fees  partially offset by lower dead deal costs in interest expense 
our interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  this interest expense is related to mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and interest and unused facility fees on our credit facility million 
as of december   we had property specific mortgage debt outstanding on twelve of our hotels 
on all but one of these hotels  we have fixed rate secured debt  which bears interest at rates ranging from to per year 
amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate that fluctuates based on the level of outstanding indebtedness in relation to the value of our assets from time to time 
the weighted average interest rate on our credit facility was as of december  we had million drawn on the credit facility as of december  our weighted average interest rate on all debt as of december  was interest income 
our interest income decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease from the comparable period in is primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our corporate cash in income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  based on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december   offset by foreign income tax expense of million related to the taxable reit subsidiary that owns the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort 
gain on early extinguishment of debt 
during the year ended december   we repaid our million fixed rate mortgage debt on the bethesda marriott suites and replaced it with a million variable rate mortgage 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of million  which is comprised of the write off of the related debt premium of million offset by a prepayment penalty of million and the write off of deferred financing costs of million 
discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was the result of the sale of the springhill suites atlanta buckhead on december  the following table summarizes the income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  in thousands revenues pre tax income from operations gain on disposal  net of million of income taxes income tax benefit from operations of related trs income from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the global financial system continued to deleverage 
as banks and other financial intermediaries reduce their leverage and incur losses on their existing portfolio of loans  the amount of capital that they are able to lend remains limited 
as a result  it is a very difficult secured borrowing environment for all borrowers  even those that have strong balance sheets 
the continuation of the constrained secured borrowing market was offset by the opening of the equity markets and the unsecured credit markets 
during  billion was raised in equity offerings by public reits 
we participated in the wave of equity offerings through our april follow on offering and the two separate controlled equity offering programs we implemented during the year 
we expect to continue the deleveraging of the company 
our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund acquisitions and future distributions to our stockholders to maintain our reit status as well as to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotels  including capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels  renovations  expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels  scheduled debt payments and making distributions to our stockholders 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  cash provided by operations and borrowings  as well as through the issuances of additional equity or debt securities 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current state of the overall credit markets  our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
our financing strategy since our formation in  we have been committed to a flexible capital structure with prudent leverage 
during though early  we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by fixing our interest rates for an extended period of time 
moreover  during the peak years and in the commercial real estate market we maintained low financial leverage by funding several of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
this capital markets strategy allowed us to maintain a balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt as the lodging cycle began to decline

as of december   we have million of mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of over years 
in addition  we currently have ten hotels unencumbered by debt and no corporate level debt outstanding 
follow on public offering 
on april   we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters overallotment of  shares  at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us  after deduction of offering costs  were approximately million 
controlled equity offering programs 
we initiated two separate controlled equity offering programs during under the first program  which was initiated on july  and completed on october   we sold million shares at an average price of per share and raised net proceeds of million 
under the second program  which was initiated on october   we sold million shares at an average price of per share and raised net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have approximately million remaining under the second program 
credit facility we are party to a four year  million unsecured credit facility the facility expiring in february we may extend the maturity date of the facility for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions 
interest is paid on the periodic advances under the facility at varying rates  based upon either libor or the alternate base rate  plus an agreed upon additional margin amount 
the interest rate depends upon our level of outstanding indebtedness in relation to the value of our assets from time to time  as follows leverage ratio or greater to to less than alternate base rate margin libor margin our facility contains various corporate financial covenants 
a summary of the most restrictive covenants is as follows actual at december  covenant maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x minimum tangible net worth million billion unhedged floating rate debt as a percentage of total indebtedness maximum leverage ratio is determined by dividing the total debt outstanding by the net asset value of our corporate assets and hotels 
hotel level net asset values are calculated based on the application of a contractual capitalization rate which range from to to the trailing twelve month hotel net operating income 
tangible net worth is defined as the gross book value of our real estate assets and other corporate assets less our total debt and all other corporate liabilities 
our facility requires that we maintain a specific pool of unencumbered borrowing base properties 
the unencumbered borrowing base assets are subject to the following limitations and covenants actual at december  covenant minimum implied debt service ratio x n a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio minimum number of unencumbered borrowing base properties minimum unencumbered borrowing base value million million percentage of total asset value owned by borrowers or guarantors if we were to default under any of the above covenants  we would be obligated to repay all amounts outstanding under our facility and our facility would terminate 
our ability to comply with two most restrictive financial covenants  the maximum leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio  depend primarily on our ebitda 
the following table shows the impact of various hypothetical scenarios on those two covenants 
ebitda change from covenant maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x x x x in addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the facility  we are required to pay an amount equal to of the unused portion of the facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than and if the unused portion of the facility is less than 
we incurred interest and unused credit facility fees of million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively  on the credit facility 
as of december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the facility 
mortgage loan default as of december   we had not completed certain capital projects required at frenchman s reef and morning star marriott beach resort frenchman s reef as required by the mortgage loan secured by the hotel the loan 
the loan stipulated that we should complete certain capital projects by december  and december   respectively  or request an extension of the due date in accordance with the loan 
the failure to complete the capital projects or receive an extension resulted in a non monetary event of default as of january  during an event of default the lender has the ability to charge default interest of percentage points above the loan s stated interest rate

dividend policy we intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends equal to our reit taxable income so as to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings other than the earnings of our trs and trs lessees  which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to reits under the code 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction  plus of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the code  minus any excess non cash income 
on january   we paid a dividend to our stockholders of record as of december  in the amount of per share  which represented of our taxable income 
we relied on the internal revenue service s revenue procedure  as amplified and superseded by revenue procedure  that allowed us to pay of the dividend in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash 
we intend to pay our next dividend to stockholders of record on a date close to december  in an amount equal to of our taxable income 
our board of directors will assess all relevant factors prior to determining whether to pay a portion of our dividend in shares of our common stock as permitted by revenue procedure the following table sets forth the dividends on common shares for the years ended december   and dividend per payment date record date share january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  capital expenditures the management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement funds to cover  among other things  the cost of replacing and repairing furniture and fixtures at our hotels 
contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues 
in addition  we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement 
as of december   we have set aside million for capital projects in property improvement funds 
funds held in property improvement funds for one hotel are typically not permitted to be applied to any other property

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
non gaap financial measures we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended in thousands net loss income interest expense income tax benefit expense real estate related depreciation ebitda amounts for the year ended december  include million of income tax benefit included in discontinued operations 
amounts for the year ended december  include million of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in determining our results after taking into account the impact of our capital structure 
year ended december  in thousands net loss income real estate related depreciation gain on property disposal  net of tax ffo amounts for the year ended december  include million of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the diamondrock hospitality company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
acquired hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value 
additions to property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting 
we record the cost of awards with service conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
no awards with performance based or market based conditions have been issued 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted 
we have elected to be treated as a reit under the provisions of the internal revenue code and  as such  are not subject to federal income tax  provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements 
in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income  we are subject to taxes on built in gains on sales of certain assets 
additionally  our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth quarters 
new accounting pronouncements there are no new unimplemented accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to the consolidated mortgage debt and other commitments of our operating partnership as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations including interest operating lease obligations ground leases and office space total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
as of december   all of our debt was fixed rate and therefore not exposed to interest rate risk
