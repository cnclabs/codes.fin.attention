item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations includes statements regarding the industry outlook and our expectations regarding the performance of our business 
these non historical statements in the discussion and analysis are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis should be read together with risk factors and the financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading north american supplier of coated papers to catalog and magazine publishers 
coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications  including catalogs  magazines  and commercial printing applications  such as high end advertising brochures  annual reports  and direct mail advertising 
we are one of north america s largest producers of coated groundwood paper which is used primarily for catalogs and magazines 
we are also a low cost producer of coated freesheet paper which is used primarily for annual reports  brochures  and magazine covers 
in addition  we have a growing presence in supercalendered paper which is primarily used for retail inserts  but also increasingly for catalogs and magazines 
we also produce and sell market kraft pulp which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products 
we have recently expanded our product line of specialty papers by introducing new specialty papers for applications in flexible packaging 
background we began operations on august   when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the business of international paper 
we were formed by affiliates of apollo for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from international paper 
verso paper corp 
went public on may   with an ipo of million shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
selected factors affecting operating results net sales our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
paper prices declined in late and early  which we believe was due to high customer and producer inventories and cautious purchasing by customers in advance of a scheduled postal rate increase 
beginning in mid  prices began to rebound following announcements by several of our north american competitors of permanent closures of approximately million tons of annual production capacity approximately of north american coated paper capacity 
these market conditions continued into early with a series of announced price increases by suppliers of coated paper 
meanwhile  customers were rebuilding their paper inventories after a significant depletion in the second half of in the second half of  we saw a significant weakening in demand as general economic conditions began to worsen 
this weakened demand  coupled with the inventory build  put downward pressure on prices in late and into  and has caused us  and most coated paper producers  to curtail production to match supply with demand 
coated prices continue to remain under pressure compared to the peak levels reached in the second half of  however  improved demand combined with market downtime  announced closures  and movements to other grades serve to balance supply with demand 
we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
in  we believe we had a leading market share for the catalog and magazine segments of coated papers 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with changes in the gdp of the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
the majority of our products are sold under contracts with our customers 
contracted sales are more prevalent for coated groundwood paper  as opposed to coated freesheet paper  which is more often sold without a contract 
our contracts generally specify the volumes to be sold to the customer over the contract term  as well as the pricing parameters for those sales 
most of our contracts are negotiated on an annual basis  with only a few having terms extending beyond one year 
typically  our contracts provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
the large portion of contracted sales allows us to plan our production runs well in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers which comprise approximately end user accounts 
in  international paper and its divisions and subsidiaries including xpedx and central lewmar llc accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
our historical results include specialty papers that we manufacture for thilmany  llc  or thilmany  on paper machine no 
at the androscoggin mill 
under a long term supply agreement entered into in in connection with international paper s sale of its industrial papers business to thilmany  these products are sold to thilmany at a variable charge for the paper purchased and a fixed charge for the availability of the machine 
the amounts included in our net sales for the specialty papers sold to thilmany totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
cost of products sold the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  maintenance  and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood  and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  starch  calcium carbonate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
in the near term  we expect the rate of inflation for our total chemical costs to be lower than that experienced over the last two years 
however  we expect imbalances in supply and demand will drive higher prices for certain chemicals 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
as we have begun to utilize wood harvested from our  acre hybrid poplar woodlands located near alexandria  minnesota  our ongoing wood costs should be positively impacted 
energy 
we produce a large portion of our energy requirements  historically producing approximately of our energy needs for our coated paper mills from sources such as waste wood and paper  hydroelectric facilities  chemicals from our pulping process  our own steam recovery boilers and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and our energy costs to increase in a high energy cost environment 
as prices fluctuate  we have some ability to switch between certain energy sources in order to minimize costs 
we utilize derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices 
labor 
labor costs include wages  salary and benefit expenses attributable to our mill personnel 
mill employees at a non managerial level are compensated on an hourly basis 
management employees at our mills are compensated on a salaried basis 
wages  salary and benefit expenses included in cost of sales do not vary significantly over the short term 
in addition  we have not experienced significant labor shortages 
maintenance 
maintenance expense includes day to day maintenance  equipment repairs and larger maintenance projects  such as paper machine shutdowns for periodic maintenance 
day to day maintenance expenses have not varied significantly from year to year 
larger maintenance projects and equipment expenses can produce year to year fluctuations in our maintenance expenses 
in conjunction with our periodic maintenance shutdowns  we have incidental incremental costs that are primarily comprised of unabsorbed fixed costs from lower production volumes and other incremental costs for purchased materials and energy that would otherwise be produced as part of the normal operation of our mills 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion expense represents the periodic charge to earnings through which the cost of tangible assets  intangible assets  and natural resources are recognized over the asset s life 
capital investments can increase our asset bases and produce year to year fluctuations in expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the principal components of our selling  general  and administrative expenses are wages  salaries and benefits for our office personnel at our headquarters and our sales force  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising expenses  expenses relating to certain information technology systems  and research and development expenses 
in addition  we previously paid an annual management fee to apollo under a management agreement pursuant to which apollo provided us with certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services 
upon the consummation of the ipo  apollo terminated the annual fee arrangement under the management agreement 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated and combined financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which we operate 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions in determining accounting estimates 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments about critical accounting estimates are based on information available to us as of the date of the financial statements 
accounting standards whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position  and that can require judgments by management that affect their application  include the following financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   contingencies  fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment  fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  and fasb asc  compensation retirement benefits 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use 
goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of these assets exceed their implied fair value 
an impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the company has identified the following trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite life influence  liberty and advocate 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and has been allocated to the coated segment 
the valuation as of october   of goodwill and trademarks assigned indefinite lives  indicated no impairment 
the evaluation for impairment is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
if impairment is indicated  then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
management believes the accounting estimates associated with determining fair value as part of the impairment test is a critical accounting estimate because estimates and assumptions are made about the company s future performance and cash flows 
while management uses the best information available to estimate future performance and cash flows  future adjustments to management s projections may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates 
pension benefit obligations 
we offer various pension plans to employees 
the calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  projected future compensation increases  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
actuarial valuations and assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
contingent liabilities 
a liability is contingent if the outcome or amount is not presently known  but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event 
we estimate our contingent liabilities based on management s estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure 
accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event 
as part of the estimation process  management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain 
the assessment of contingent liabilities  including legal contingencies  asset retirement obligations and environmental costs and obligations  involves the use of critical estimates  assumptions and judgments 
management s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not differ from management s assessments 
recent accounting developments fair value measurements and disclosures in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu   fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which provides additional guidance relating to fair value measurement disclosures 
specifically  companies will be required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of level and level measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers 
for level fair value measurements  the new guidance requires a gross presentation of activities within the level roll forward 
additionally  the fasb also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements relating to the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
this asu is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the detailed level disclosures  which are effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december  since asu only affects disclosure requirements  the adoption of these provisions will have no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
financial overview the economic downturn has presented a significant challenge for manufacturers of coated paper as reduced spending on advertising and the overall weak retail market significantly impacted our customers  especially magazine and catalog publishers  resulting in unprecedented declines in demand for coated papers in the first half of coated paper demand strengthened during the second half of  and shipments were significantly improved in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  and were down only slightly from the seasonally strong third quarter of on a quarterly basis  year over year demand has increased as mill and end user inventories have moved to the lowest level in over five years 
however  coated paper prices remained under pressure from the peak levels reached in the second half of improved demand combined with market downtime and movements to other grades serve to balance supply with demand 
net sales for the fourth quarter of increased as sales volume increased compared to last year s fourth quarter  reflecting an increase in demand  which includes the effects of lower customer inventory levels 
the average sales price fell from the fourth quarter of  and fell sequentially from the third quarter of additionally  new product initiatives increased net sales by million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in  reflecting the development of new paper product offerings for our customers 
in response to market conditions  we continue to assess and implement  as appropriate  various expense reduction initiatives 
our company wide cost reduction program produced approximately million of savings during and is expected to yield an additional million in cost reductions 
management expects to achieve most of these savings in included in this program are material usage reductions  energy usage reductions  labor cost savings  chemical substitution  selling  general  and administrative expense reductions  and workforce planning improvements 
also included in the results for are million in pre tax net benefits from alternative fuel mixture tax credits provided by the us government for our use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures and million in pre tax net gains from the early retirement of debt 
the impact of these tax credits is excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
the tax credit  as it relates to liquid fuels derived from biomass  expired on december  therefore  we will not recognize any proceeds from this tax credit in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated and combined financial information for the years ended december   and cost of sales in the following table and discussion includes the cost of products sold and depreciation  amortization and depletion 
the following table and discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
year ended december  in thousands of us dollars net sales costs and expenses cost of products sold exclusive of depreciation  amortization  and depletion depreciation  amortization  and depletion selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges operating income loss interest income interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales for decreased to  million from  million as total sales volume decreased compared to last year  primarily reflecting lower demand for coated papers in a difficult economic environment and lower sales prices 
the average sales price per ton for all of our products fell in due to the weak demand 
net sales for our coated and supercalendered papers segment decreased to  million in from  million in the decrease reflects a decrease in paper sales volume and a decrease in average paper sales price per ton for compared to net sales for our market pulp segment decreased to million in from million in this decline was due to a decrease in average sales price per ton combined with a decrease in sales volume compared to net sales for our other segment increased to million in from million in new product offerings contributed to the improvement as sales volume increased in this was partially offset by a decrease in average sales price per ton compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales  including depreciation  amortization  and depletion  decreased to  million in from  million in  primarily reflecting the decline in sales volume and the effects of our expense reduction initiatives 
our gross margin  excluding depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was for  compared to for this compression in the margin reflects lower average sales prices in and million of unabsorbed costs resulting from approximately  tons of market downtime taken in compared to million of unabsorbed costs resulting from approximately  tons of market downtime taken in  as we curtailed production in response to weak demand for coated papers 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion expense was million for  compared to million for selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  reflecting the absence of expenses associated with our ipo and the effect of our expense reduction initiatives 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in included in interest expense is million from a prepayment penalty and the write off of debt issuance costs resulting from the partial repayment of our senior unsecured term loan with a portion of the ipo proceeds 
interest expense for includes million of cash interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness and million of non cash interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs 
other income 
other income was million in and includes million in net benefits from alternative fuel mixture tax credits provided by the us government for our use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures and million in net gains related to the early retirement of debt 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges in  were million compared to million in restructuring and other charges are comprised of transition and other costs ie  technology migration costs  consulting and legal fees  and other one time costs  including those associated with the acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  we entered into a management agreement with apollo relating to the provision of certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services 
upon consummation of the ipo  apollo terminated the annual fee arrangement under the management agreement for a one time fee of million in compared to net sales 
net sales grew to  million in from  million in the growth was the result of a increase in the average sales price per ton for all of our products in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in total sales volume  reflecting lower coated paper demand in a difficult economic environment 
net sales for our coated and supercalendered papers segment were  million in  compared to  million in  an increase of 
the improvement reflects a increase in average paper sales price which was partially offset by a decrease in paper sales volume compared to net sales for our hardwood market pulp segment were relatively stable at million in  compared to million in this result reflected a decrease in pulp sales volume which was largely offset by a increase in average pulp sales price 
net sales for our other segment increased to million in from million in this increase reflects an increase in average sales price combined with an increase in sales volume compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales  including depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was  million in compared to  million in  an increase of which was primarily driven by higher input costs 
our gross margin  excluding depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was for compared to for  reflecting the higher average sales price in depreciation  amortization  and depletion expenses were million in compared to million in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in included in selling  general  and administrative expenses for is a one time charge of million due to the accelerated vesting of the legacy class c units of verso paper management lp in connection with our ipo 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in included in interest expense is million from a prepayment penalty and the write off of debt issuance costs resulting from the partial repayment of our senior unsecured term loan with a portion of the ipo proceeds 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to the reduction in aggregate indebtedness and lower interest rates on floating rate debt compared to interest expense for includes million of cash interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness and million of non cash interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were million in compared to million in restructuring and other charges are comprised of transition and other costs associated with the acquisition  including costs of a transition service agreement with international paper  technology migration costs  consulting and legal fees  and other one time costs related to becoming a stand alone business 
subsequent to the acquisition  we entered into a management agreement with apollo relating to the provision of certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services 
upon consummation of the ipo  apollo terminated the annual fee arrangement under the management agreement for a one time payment of million  which is included in the charges for the charges in included million of transition service agreement costs and million of charges under the management agreement 
as of september   we substantially discontinued the use of services under the transition service agreement 
seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the coated paper industry 
typically  the first two quarters are our slowest quarters due to lower demand for coated paper during this period 
our third quarter is generally our strongest quarter  reflecting an increase in printing related to end of year magazines  increased end of year direct mailings  and holiday season catalogs 
our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season 
we expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily upon cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance operations  capital expenditures and fluctuations in debt service requirements 
we believe that our ability to manage cash flow and working capital levels  particularly inventory and accounts payable  will allow us to meet our current and future obligations  pay scheduled principal and interest payments  and provide funds for working capital  capital expenditures and other needs of the business for at least the next twelve months 
however  given the uncertainty of the current economic environment  no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
as of december   million was available for future borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
as we focus on managing our expenses and cash flows  we continue to assess and implement  as appropriate  various earnings and expense reduction initiatives 
management has developed a company wide cost reduction program which produced approximately million of savings during and is expected to yield an additional million in cost reductions 
we may also dispose of certain of our non core assets in order to obtain additional liquidity 
net cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to improved results with million net income in compared to million net losses in net income in includes million in net benefits from alternative fuel mixture tax credits provided by the us government for our use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures and million in non cash gains on the early retirement of debt 
the tax credit  as it relates to liquid fuels derived from biomass  expired on december  therefore  we will not recognize any proceeds from this tax credit in future periods 
partially offsetting this net positive impact on cash flows was the negative effect of changes in working capital in  which included declines in accrued liabilities and accounts payable  primarily due to lower input costs  and an increase in accounts receivable  reflecting the recent improvement in sales and the million accrual of alternative fuel mixture tax credits earned  while inventory balances decreased 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to improved performance  with a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in net cash flows from investing activities 
in   and  we used million  million  and million  respectively  of net cash in investing activities primarily for investments in capital expenditures 
management significantly reduced annual capital expenditures in in response to the uncertain economic environment 
the majority of these capital expenditures were realized during the first half of the year while the mills were experiencing significant market downtime 
net cash flows from financing activities 
in we used net cash of million on financing activities  reflecting principal payments and debt repurchases of million on long term debt and million in net payments on our revolving credit facility  partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of million in senior secured notes net of discount  underwriting fees  and issuance costs 
this compares to million of net cash provided by financing activities in  which reflected principal payments of million on outstanding borrowings and dividends paid of million offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and million in borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
in cash flows from financing activities provided million of net cash as the million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured term loan were distributed to our equity holders  scheduled principal payments of million were made on the senior secured term loan  and borrowings under revolving credit facilities increased by million 
indebtedness 
as of december   our aggregate indebtedness was  million  net of million of unamortized discounts 
on december   verso paper holdings llc  or verso holdings  had a credit facility and outstanding debt securities consisting of million revolving credit facility maturing in  under which no amounts were outstanding  million in letters of credit were issued  and million was available for future borrowing 
our availability under our revolving credit facility has been reduced by million as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman commercial paper  inc  lehman 
as a result of lehman s inability to fulfill its obligation under the revolving credit facility  we do not expect that lehman will fund its pro rata share of any future borrowing requests 
million aggregate principal amount of senior secured fixed rate notes due  million aggregate principal amount of second priority senior secured fixed rate notes due  million aggregate principal amount of second priority senior secured floating rate notes due  and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated fixed rate notes due the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus and or prime plus 
verso holdings is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of unutilized commitments at a rate equal to per annum and customary letter of credit and agency fees 
the revolving credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all tangible and intangible assets of verso holdings and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
it is also secured by first priority pledges of all the equity interests owned by verso holdings in its subsidiaries 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by verso paper finance holdings llc  or verso finance  and  subject to certain exceptions  each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
on june   the credit agreement was amended and restated to provide for the issuance of the senior secured notes due july  see below 
the amendment also  among other things  increased the applicable margin for the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility to for eurodollar loans and for base rate loans and eliminated the requirement to maintain a net first lien secured debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  providing us with additional business flexibility 
the revolving credit facility is secured on a ratable and pari passu basis with the senior secured notes due on june   verso holdings issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due july  these fixed rate notes pay interest semi annually 
the notes are secured by substantially all of the property and assets of verso holdings and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
the notes are secured on a ratable and pari passu basis with the revolving credit facility 
the net proceeds  after deducting the discount  underwriting fees  and issuance costs  were million  which funds were used to repay in full million outstanding on verso holdings first priority term loan and to temporarily reduce the debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility by million 
the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan resulted in a loss of million 
on january   verso holdings issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes under the existing indenture 
these notes will be treated as a single series with and have the same terms as the notes issued under the indenture in june the net proceeds including premium  after deducting underwriting fees and before deducting offering expenses  were million 
we intend to use the net proceeds for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
during  we repurchased and retired million of verso holdings second priority senior secured fixed rate notes due on august   for a total purchase price of million  which resulted in gains of million  net of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
during  we also repurchased and retired million of verso holdings second priority senior secured floating rate notes due on august   for a total purchase price of million  which resulted in gains of million  net of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
in addition  we de designated the interest rate swap hedging interest payments on these notes and recognized losses of million on the interest rate swap 
the second priority senior secured fixed rate notes have a fixed interest rate of and pay interest semiannually 
the second priority senior secured floating rate notes bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus and pay interest quarterly 
at december   the interest rate was 
the original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes was outstanding at december  these senior subordinated notes have a fixed interest rate of and pay interest semi annually 
the second priority senior secured fixed rate and floating rate notes have the benefit of a second priority security interest in the collateral securing our senior secured credit facility  while the subordinated notes are unsecured 
additionally  verso finance has million aggregate principal amount outstanding on its senior unsecured floating rate term loan which matures in in may  a portion of the net proceeds from our ipo were used to repay million of the outstanding principal of the term loan and to pay a related million prepayment penalty 
during  we repurchased million of the term loan for a total purchase price of million  which resulted in gains of million  net of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
the term loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus on interest payments made in cash and libor plus for interest paid in kind  or pik  and added to the principal balance 
the weighted average interest rate in effect on december   was 
the term loan allows verso finance to pay interest either in cash or in kind through the accumulation of the outstanding principal amount 
verso finance has elected to exercise the pik option for million of interest payments due in in addition  as a holding company  our investments in our operating subsidiaries  including verso paper llc  constitute substantially all of our operating assets 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our operating assets 
our principal source of the cash we need to pay our debts is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
the terms of the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes of our subsidiaries significantly restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us 
furthermore  our subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us 
although the terms of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries do not restrict our operating subsidiaries from obtaining funds from their respective subsidiaries to fund their operations and payments on indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund our obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders 
we may elect to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
these repurchases may be funded through available cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facilities 
such repurchases are dependent on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
covenant compliance the credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes contain affirmative covenants as well as restrictive covenants which limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase or redeem our stock  make investments  sell assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and incur liens 
these covenants can result in limiting our long term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements 
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs  such as for energy  wood fiber  and chemicals  have an impact on our operating results  changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in the last three years 
sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires our performance pursuant to a funding commitment 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total long term debt includes principal payments  commitment fees  and interest payable 
a portion of interest expense is at a variable rate and has been calculated using current libor 
actual payments could vary 
purchase obligations include unconditional purchase obligations for power purchase agreements gas and electricity  machine clothing  and other commitments for advertising  raw materials  or storeroom inventory 
other long termliabilities reflected above represent the gross amount of asset retirement obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in our paper prices  interest rates  energy prices  and commodity prices for our inputs 
paper prices our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances  and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors  which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with gdp in the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
the majority of our products are sold under contracts with our customers  however  coated freesheet paper is sold without a contract more often then coated groundwood paper 
our contracts generally specify the volumes to be sold to the customer over the contract term  as well as the pricing parameters for those sales 
most of our contracts are negotiated on an annual basis  with only a few having terms extending beyond one year 
typically  our contracts provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
the large portion of contracted sales allows us to plan our production runs well in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers 
in  international paper and its divisions and subsidiaries including xpedx and central lewmar llc accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
interest rates we issued fixed and floating rate debt to finance the acquisition in order to manage our variability to cash flows from interest rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our floating rate notes accrue interest at variable rates  but there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  a basis point increase in quoted interest rates on our debt balances outstanding as of december   under our floating rate notes would increase our annual interest expense by million 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
derivatives in the normal course of business  we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates 
these instruments are subject to credit and market risks in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated 
we have an energy risk management policy which was adopted by our board of directors and is monitored by an energy risk management committee composed of our senior management 
in addition  we have an interest rate risk committee which was formed to monitor our interest rate risk management policy 
credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through approved counterparties 
market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent that we do not hedge against commodity price volatility  our results of operations may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the future price curve 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses of million on open commodity contracts with maturities of one to fifteen months 
these derivative instruments involve the exchange of net cash settlements  based on changes in the price of the underlying commodity index compared to the fixed price offering  at specified intervals without the exchange of any underlying principal 
a decrease in commodity prices would have a negative impact of approximately million on the fair value of such instruments 
this quantification of exposure to market risk does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in prices on anticipated future energy purchases 
we entered into a million notional value receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swap in connection with our outstanding floating rate notes that mature in we are hedging the cash flow exposure on our quarterly variable rate interest payments due to changes in the benchmark interest rate three month libor 
as of december   the fair value of this swap was an unrealized loss of million 
this swap expired on february  commodity prices we are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements underlying commodity prices 
the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  maintenance  and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  starch  calcium carbonate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
in the near term  we expect the rate of inflation for our total chemical costs to be lower than that experienced over the last two years 
however  we expect imbalances in supply and demand will drive higher prices for certain chemicals such as starch and sodium chlorate 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
as we have begun to utilize wood harvested from our  acre hybrid poplar woodlands located near alexandria  minnesota  our ongoing wood costs should be positively impacted 
energy 
we produce a large portion of our energy requirements  historically producing approximately of our energy needs for our coated paper mills from sources such as waste wood and paper  hydroelectric facilities  chemicals from our pulping process  our own steam recovery boilers  and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal  and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and our energy costs to increase in a high energy cost environment 
as prices fluctuate  we have some ability to switch between certain energy sources in order to minimize costs 
we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices
