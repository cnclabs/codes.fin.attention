table of contents overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp transcription factors zfp tfs and zfp nucleases zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner funding will continue beyond their initial terms 
in the development of our zfp technology platform we have continued to place more emphasis internally on higher value therapeutic product development and less on our enabling technology applications 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject us to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we have filed investigational new drug ind applications with the us food and drug administration fda and have initiated several phase clinical trials and a phase b trial of a zfp therapeutic in subjects with diabetic neuropathy and one phase clinical trial in subjects with als 
we are also conducting two phase clinical trials to evaluate a zfp therapeutic for the treatment of hiv aids and one phase study to evaluate a zfp therapeutic for the treatment of glioblastoma  a type of brain cancer 
development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  stock based compensation expenses  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing expenses  allocated facilities expenses  subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase as we focus on development of zfp therapeutics 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance 
table of contents with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future licensee s product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we estimate the performance period at the inception of the arrangement and reevaluate it each reporting period 
this reevaluation may shorten or lengthen the period over which the remaining revenue is recognized 
changes to these estimates are recorded on a prospective basis 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which have not been earned 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
research and development expenses we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist of direct and research related allocated overhead costs such as facilities costs  salaries and related personnel costs  and material and supply costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include costs related to clinical trials to validate our testing processes and procedures and related overhead expenses 
expenses resulting from clinical trials are recorded when incurred based in part on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee share options and employee share purchases related to the 
table of contents employee share purchase plan espp  on estimated fair values  utilizing the modified prospective transition method 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method 
to estimate the value of an award  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected life  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
while estimates of expected life and volatility are derived primarily from our historical data  the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and  as a result  it is likely we will change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
further  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements research grants total revenues total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and research grants 
we anticipate revenues over the next several years will primarily be related to our research license and commercial option agreement with dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of dow chemical corporation and our research and commercial license agreements with sigma aldrich corporation sigma 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased revenues of million in connection with our license agreements with sigma and increased revenues of million in connection with our agreement with das  partially offset by decreased revenues of million in connection with our research and commercial license agreements with pfizer inc pfizer 
the increase in from was attributable to increased revenues of approximately million in connection with our research and commercial license agreements with pfizer  increased revenues of million in connection with our laboratory research reagents license agreement with sigma  increased revenues of million in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das and increased revenues of  in connection with our research and license agreement with genentech  inc research grant revenues were  in  million in and million in the decrease in from was primarily attributable to decreased revenues of  related to our grant with the juvenile diabetes research foundation international jdrf and decreased revenues of  
table of contents related to our grant with the michael j 
fox foundation for parkinson s research mjff 
the decrease in from was primarily attributable to decreased revenues of  related to our grant with jdrf   in connection with our advanced technology program atp grant awarded by the national institute of standards and technology and  related to our cystic fibrosis grant awarded by the cystic fibrosis foundation 
this was partially offset by increased revenues of  related to our grant with mjff and  related to our grant with the defense advanced research projects agency 
operating expenses year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing costs  allocated facilities expenses  subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease of million in from was primarily due to decreased pre clinical studies expenses of million  primarily related to our hiv aids and glioblastoma programs  and related decreases in consulting expenses of  and laboratory supplies expenses of  the decrease was partially offset primarily by increased salaries and personnel related expenses of million  including increased stock based compensation expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expenses was primarily due to a true up of actual versus previously estimated forfeitures of stock option grants 
the increase of million in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to increased pre clinical and clinical studies and manufacturing expenses of million  primarily associated with our diabetic neuropathy program and increased salaries and personnel related expenses of million  including increased stock based compensation expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation was due to increased grant activity  higher black scholes value per share and lower estimated forfeitures 
consulting expenses increased by  primarily in support of our diabetic neuropathy program  and facility expenses increased by  primarily due to the company leasing additional space 
this was partially offset by decreased expenses related to licensing and external research of  our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for neurological disorders  hiv aids  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp engineered cell lines for protein production and generation of transgenic animals  and zfp tfs and zfns for applications in agricultural biotechnology

material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation and gene modification technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
prior to january   due to the early stage of our various internal research and development programs  we did not track associated expenses on a program by program basis 
since january   management has categorized research and development expenses by program 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  sb and sb t  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects and activity associated with various research collaborations

the income in compared to the expense in and the expense in compared to the income in  are due to fluctuations in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
during  the use of cash related to our net operating loss of million was partially offset by net non cash charges of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to issuance of stock in connection with an expanded license agreement with sigma and an underwritten public offering 
in october  pursuant to the expanded license agreement with sigma  sangamo issued  shares of common stock valued at per share to sigma  resulting in proceeds of million 
additionally  in october  the company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock  in which sangamo sold an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities in was related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises

in july  pursuant to a laboratory research reagents license agreement with sigma  the company issued million shares of common stock valued at per share to sigma  resulting in proceeds of million 
all other cash provided by financing activities in was related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  to support our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through we may need to raise additional capital to fund our zfp therapeutic development activities 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  our business and our ability to develop and commercialize our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  both the net federal and state operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in the company also has federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year and the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating 
table of contents loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before use 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees  milestones and royalties due from sales of zfp tfs and zfns 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new standards permit entities to initially use management s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or when third party evidence is not available 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for annual periods ending after june  and are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  however early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting these new standards on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments 
the investments are available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
we invest excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
we carry our investments of debt securities at fair value  estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
a combination of factors in the housing and mortgage markets  including rising delinquency and default rates on subprime mortgages and declining home prices  has led to increases in actual and expected credit losses for residential mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
since  the credit markets have been reacting to these changing factors and the prices of many securities backed by subprime mortgages have been declining 
lower volumes of transactions in certain types of collateralized securities might make it more difficult to obtain relevant market information to 
table of contents estimate the fair value of these financial instruments 
in accordance with our investment policy  we diversify our credit risk and invest in debt securities with high credit quality 
substantially all our investments held as of december  are actively traded and our estimate of fair value is based upon quoted market prices 
we have not recorded losses on our securities due to credit or liquidity issues 
we will continue to monitor our credit risks and evaluate the potential need for impairment charges related to credit risks in future periods 
as of december  all of our assets and liabilities are valued in us dollars and fluctuations in global currencies do not present a significant market risk
