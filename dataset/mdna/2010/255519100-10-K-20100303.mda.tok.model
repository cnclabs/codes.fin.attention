item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview demand for products manufactured by the united states carpet industry and our business has been significantly affected by declining demand as tighter credit conditions  lower consumer confidence and other economic factors reduced the level of new residential housing construction  the sales and refurbishment of existing homes and more recently  the levels of business construction and refurbishment activity 
as a result of these factors  our sales declined in the year over year comparisons during each of the last three years and over for the three year period ended december  during this same three year period  sales for the carpet industry were down approximately 
unit production in the carpet industry has declined for the fourth consecutive year and is now at of its peak in early in the third and fourth quarters of  our sales began slowing at a greater rate than the sales of the carpet industry 
we believe our res ults reflect the impact of the overall downturn as it reached the higher end of the market where our business is concentrated 
we have aggressively been reducing costs and conserving capital in an effort to return our company to profitability at current sales levels 
raw material prices have increased in early and we have announced sales price increases to recoup these cost increases 
while it is difficult to predict the length of the current downturn and its impact on the markets we serve  we have seen signs that indicate more stabilization in residential carpet markets 
however  we believe conditions affecting certain commercial carpet markets may continue to negatively affect demand 
we believe our position in the upper end of the market will permit us to benefit from improved conditions and grow our sales at a rate that will exceed the rate of growth of the carpet industry  as and when economic conditions improve 
facility consolidations and cost reduction plans in response to the difficult economic conditions  we developed plans in the fourth quarter of to reduce costs by consolidating our eton  georgia carpet tufting operation into our atmore  alabama tufting  dyeing and finishing facilities  consolidating our santa ana  california tufting operations into our santa ana  california dying  finishing and distribution facility and making organizational and other changes to reduce staff and expenses throughout our company 
the consolidation of our east coast tufting operations was substantially completed in the first quarter of along with the organizational and staff reductions 
the consolidation of our west coast operations was completed during the fourth quarter of these actions better align our operations with current business activity levels and reduce cost 
expenses incurred in for the consolidation and organizational changes associated with the consolidation and cost reduction plan were million  bringing the total costs for the plan to million since inception in the third quarter of cost incurred during included million of costs to consolidate facilities  thousand of severance and employee relocation expenses and million of estimated costs associated with the exit of our leased facility in santa ana  california 
during the third quarter of  we developed and began implementing a plan to realign our organizational structure to further reduce cost and streamline operations 
under the plan  we combined our three residential carpet units into one business with three distinct brands 
as a result  our residential business will be organized much like our commercial carpet business and more like the rest of the industry 
costs of this realignment include severance  limited employee relocation expenses  and computer systems conversion expenses required to support the realignment 
the realignment was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of costs incurred under this realignment plan were thousand in we estimate costs of approximately thousand  primarily system related conversion cost  will be incurred in early to complete the realignment 
in addition to the facilities consolidations  employee reductions and the organizational realignment  we suspended our match of certain k contributions for and lowered the compensation of our exempt salaried associates in march we have lowered our total number of associates by since the beginning of and reduced annual costs significantly 
these actions had a positive impact on our results in and are expected to result in additional improvements in with improved operational capabilities  a reduction in under absorbed fixed costs and other cost reductions 

table of contents page long lived asset impairments long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  as we began consolidating certain of our operations and facilities  certain assets were identified  primarily computer systems under development  that would not be utilized going forward 
as a result  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of million to reflect the write off of these assets 
during  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of million for long lived asset impairments primarily related to leasehold improvement assets in the california leased facility that  subsequent to the exit of the leased facility  will not provide future economic benefit to the company  other manufacturing related assets that will no longer be used as a result of the california facilities consolidation and additional computer software taken out of service in the systems consolida tion process 
goodwill impairment our goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill associated with a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable see note c of our consolidated financial statements related to our goodwill assessment process 
we tested goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of due to economic conditions and uncertainty that were impacting our markets and the future expectations for the performance of our business 
no goodwill impairment was indicated as a result of this evaluation 
our annual goodwill impairment test is performed in october of each year 
when the annual goodwill impairment test was performed  we reduced our projections for the future sales and profitability because economic conditions in the carpet industry had continued to deteriorate 
in addition  external financial metrics we utilize in our calcula tions to determine our weighted average cost of capital wacc changed significantly 
as a result of this decline in the cash flow projections  and the higher wacc  goodwill was potentially impaired in our two reporting units that had goodwill associated with their operations 
because our assessment indicated that goodwill may not be fully recoverable  we performed the second step in the goodwill evaluation process the measurement resulted in the impairment of all of the goodwill  or million associated with the acquisition of patrick carpet mills  inc in and million  or approximately of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc in the total non cash goodwill impairment loss recognized in was million 
because economic conditions in the carpet industry deteriorated further in the first quarter of  we again reduced our expectations for the future sales and profitability of the reporting unit fabrica that had goodwill remaining and tested goodwill for impairment 
as a result of the decline in the cash flow expectations for fabrica  the test indicated that goodwill was potentially impaired 
the second step in the goodwill assessment was completed and the measurement resulted in the impairment of the remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc  accordingly  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment loss of million in the first quarter of as a result of this goodwill impairment and the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in  we have no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet at december  results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in  while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
capital expenditures in will be primarily for enhancements to existing equipment and facilities 
in october  we amended and restated our senior loan and security agreement to extend the agreement s maturity date from may  to may   decrease the monthly term loan principal installments and increase interest rates applicable to borrowings under the agreement to more current market interest rates 
effective january   the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement was further amended to modify certain interest rate definitions to change the relative relationship between base rates and libor rates as used in the agreement and to reduce the applicable credit spreads for base rate loans by 
effective july   we reduced our revolving credit facility from million to million to better align the size of the revolving credit facility with the anticipated levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
our amended and restated senior loan and security agreement provides million of credit  co nsisting of million of revolving credit and a million term loan 
the term loan is payable in monthly principal installments of thousand and is due may  interest rates available under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow us to borrow at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate plus to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  and at december  commitment fees ranging from to per annum are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on a portion of borrowings under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement are fixed by an interest rate swap arrangement that effectively fixes the interest rate on million of borrowings under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement at plus the appli cable credit spreads 
the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory limit borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
our amended and restated senior loan and security agreement does not contain ongoing financial covenants and permits payment of dividends and repurchases of our common stock in an aggregate annual amount of up to million and distributions in excess of million under conditions specified in the agreement 
the agreement also contains covenants that could limit future acquisitions 
unused borrowing capacity under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement on december  was million

accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of thousand have been excluded from the summary of contractual obligations 
we believe our operating cash flows  credit availability under our senior loan and security agreement and other sources of financing are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements 
we will continue  as we have in  to aggressively pursue inventory management  maintain tight cost controls and limit capital expenditures 
we anticipate a federal income tax refund in excess of million which we believe we will receive in the first half of the year 
however  continued deterioration in our markets or significant additional cash expenditures above our normal liquidity requirements could require supplemental financing or other funding sources 
there can be no assurance that such supplemental financing or other sources of funding can be obtained or will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
income tax considerations 
in november  federal tax legislation was enacted that extended the period for tax loss carrybacks from two to five years 
approximately million of federal and state income tax refunds are expected in due to carrybacks of net operating loss to prior years  including approximately million due to the extension of the tax loss carryback period 
excluding these income tax refunds  we anticipate that cash outlays for income taxes will not be materially different from our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
because we are in a net deferred tax liability position  our thousand federal income tax credit carryforward benefits are expected to be utilized in the future 
during  we increased our tax valuation reserve related to future benefits for state net operating loss carryforwards by million

critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 

table of contents page estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title to products shipped and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
stock based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share based stock awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument over the period of vesting for the individual stock awards that were granted 
at december   the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock awards was million with a weighted average vesting period of years and unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was thousand with a weighted average vesting period of years 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates  among other factors 
it is our policy to minimize our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding our company with debt 
we address this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement on our mortgage note payable with a notional amount equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage note  at december  which expires in march of under the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of interest times the notional amount and receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the mortgage note payable at on october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  through may  under this agreement  we pay a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and receive in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap agreement is linked to our variable rate debt and is considered a highly effective hedge 
at december    or approximately of our total debt  was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact of approximately
