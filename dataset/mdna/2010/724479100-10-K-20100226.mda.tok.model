a continued global economic downturn resulted in a decline in revenue for the year in six of our seven business segments 
historically  mail volumes have tracked economic conditions and the unprecedented volume decreases in were indicative of the extent of the economic slowdown 
although there is not a direct correlation between mail volumes and a majority of our revenues  the decline in mail volumes was one of a number of factors that affected our revenues 
ebit margins  however  were up in four of our segments from reflecting our continued cost management actions 
we reduced our selling  general and administrative expense by over million during  despite increased pension costs of million when compared to the prior year 
in addition  we generated million in cash from operations during we also reduced our debt by million during see results of operations for  and for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations 
outlook economic and business conditions in mail intensive industries have been weak during the entire year 
sales cycles for most capital purchase decisions by customers remain long 
these factors have impacted our financial results  as the sustained economic downturn has had a negative effect on equipment sales and the related high margin financing  rental  and supplies revenue streams 
while the company has been successful in reducing its cost structure across its entire business and is shifting to a more variable cost structure  these actions have not been enough to offset the impact of lower revenue 
we continue to expect our mix of revenue to change  with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales 
we expect that our future results will continue to be impacted by changes in global economic conditions and their impact on mail intensive industries 
it is not expected that total mail volumes will rebound to prior peak levels in an economic recovery  and future volume trends will continue to be a factor for our businesses 
we are undertaking a series of initiatives that are designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company 
in order to enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions  we are executing a strategic transformation program designed to create improved processes and systems to further enable us to invest in future growth in areas such as our global customer interactions and product development processes 
this program is expected to continue into and will result in the reduction of up to percent of the positions in the company 
we expect the total pre tax cost of this program will be in the range of million to million primarily related to severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with such workforce reductions 
most of the total pre tax costs will be cash related charges 
currently  we are targeting annualized benefits  net of system and related investments  in the range of at least million to million on a pre tax basis 
these costs and the related benefits will be recognized as different actions are approved and implemented  with the goal of reaching the full benefit run rate in results of operations compared to business segment results the following table shows revenue and earnings before interest and taxes ebit in and by business segment

our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following growth and expansion opportunities  internal investments  customer financing  restructuring payments  tax payments  interest and dividend payments  pension and other benefit plan funding  acquisitions  and share repurchase program 
we continue to review our liquidity profile 
we have carefully monitored for material changes in the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties  depository banks or credit providers to us through credit ratings and the credit default swap market 
we have determined that there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company 
to date  we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market 
cash flow summary the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows dollars in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities

partially offsetting these positive impacts were restructuring payments of million associated with the program initiated in and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to timing of these payments

capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in the decrease in spend on property  plant and equipment and net additions to rental equipment and related inventories is due to lower new meter placements in and tighter control over capital spending

the amount and period of future payments related to our income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and  therefore  is not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  customer cancellations  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation  and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
we classify our leases in accordance with the lease accounting guidance 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables 
the difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses based on our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with the accounting for income taxes guidance 
in  we adopted guidance addressing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the guidance defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position 
this is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required 
both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications 
we have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
we adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
goodwill and long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally to years and buildings up to years 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally to years  using the straight line method or an accelerated attrition method 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability and  if necessary  the fair value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
we derive the cash flow estimates that are incorporated into the analysis from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and  if necessary  apply an appropriate discount rate to assist in the determination of its fair value 
in addition  we used quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to assist in the determination of fair value 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we use a combination of various techniques  including the present value of future cash flows  earnings multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses  to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated into the long lived asset and goodwill assessments could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
for  based upon our impairment reviews for goodwill and long lived assets  where appropriate  no impairments were identified 
during the review of our annual goodwill impairment test  the calculated fair values for all of our reporting units were considered substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value  with the exception of one reporting unit 
this reporting unit  which represents the international operations of our management services segment  had a calculated fair value in excess of its carrying value 
at december   the carrying value of this reporting unit included an allocation of goodwill of million 
the calculated fair value of each of our reporting units was based on a combination of inputs and assumptions 
these inputs and assumptions include projections of future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates and applicable earnings multiples of competitors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded in and we believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at december  however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology 
significant ongoing negative economic or industry trends 
changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets 
future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates the valuation and calculation of our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates 
we make assumptions relating to discount rate  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following assumptions relate to our us qualified pension plan  which is our largest plan 
we determine our discount rate for the us retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was at december  and at december  our expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolio after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is determined based on the target asset allocations for each asset class  adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results  when compared to the benchmark returns 
when assessing the expected future returns for the portfolio  we place more emphasis on the expected future returns than historical returns 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was at december  and sensitivity to changes in assumptions us pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
the following assumptions relate to our uk qualified pension plan  which is our largest foreign plan 
we determine our discount rate for the uk retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was at december  and at december  our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was and at december  and  respectively 
uk pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
delayed recognition principles in accordance with the retirement benefits accounting guidance  actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
in accordance with this approach  we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities  real estate investments and private equity investments 
the composition of our uk pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and cash 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with equity securities  it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results 
new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition in september  new guidance was introduced addressing the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements and certain revenue arrangements that include software 
the new literature will allow companies to allocate consideration in a multiple element arrangement in a way that better reflects the economics of the transaction 
this will result in the elimination of the residual method 
in addition  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will be scoped out of the software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will also result in more expansive disclosures 
the new guidance will be effective on january   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance 
pension disclosures on december   we adopted new accounting guidance requiring more detailed disclosures about employers postretirement benefit plan assets  including investment strategies  major categories of assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets 
the company has complied with the additional disclosure requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our postretirement benefit plan disclosures 
noncontrolling interests on january   we adopted new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests 
the new guidance addresses the accounting and reporting for the outstanding noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
the guidance requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests while all other requirements of the guidance are applied prospectively 
business combinations on january   we adopted new accounting guidance on business combinations 
the new guidance revises principles and requirements for how a company a recognizes and measures in their financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
some of the major impacts of this new guidance include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs 
the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities on january   we adopted new accounting guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new guidance impacts disclosures only and requires additional qualitative and quantitative information on the use of derivatives and their impact on an entity s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted new accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
the new guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it was effective for certain financial assets and liabilities on january  and for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on january  the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on fair value measurements 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
the amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
the current irs exam of tax years is estimated to be completed within the next two years and the examination of years has commenced 
in connection with the exam  we have received notices of proposed adjustments to our filed returns 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
we are also disputing a formal request from the irs in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers 
we believe that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged 
a decision by the rhode island us district court in a similar case that supported our position was overturned on appeal by the first circuit court of appeals and the federal judicial circuits are now divided on this issue 
the taxpayer in the first circuit decision has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the us supreme court requesting review of the first circuit decision 
also in connection with the audits  we have entered into a settlement with the irs regarding the tax treatment of certain lease transactions related to the capital services business that we sold in prior to  we accrued and paid the irs the additional tax associated with this settlement 
a variety of post tax years remain subject to examination by other tax authorities  including the uk  canada  france  germany and various uk states 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
during  we expect to reverse tax benefits of approximately million associated with the expiration of out of the money vested stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units previously granted to our employees 
these write offs of deferred tax assets will not require the payment of any taxes 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although minimal in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  where applicable  price increases 
currency translation decreased our revenue by approximately 
also  currency translation losses decreased our income before taxes by million 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million 
although not affecting income  balance sheet related deferred translation losses of million were recorded in resulting primarily from the strengthening us dollar as compared to the british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation losses of million resulting primarily from the strengthening us dollar as compared to the british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation gains of million resulting primarily from the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to reduce our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
at december   we had million  million and million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding maturing in   and  respectively  to buy or sell various currencies 
as a result of the use of derivative instruments  we are exposed to counterparty risk 
to mitigate such risks  we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividends it is a general practice of our board of directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs 
we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate derivative contracts as well as our foreign exchange derivative contracts associated with forecasted transactions 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
