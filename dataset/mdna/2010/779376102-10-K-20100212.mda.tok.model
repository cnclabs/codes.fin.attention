industry background the entertainment media market is experiencing a major transformation from analog to digital content 
the design  distribution  protection and consumption of all forms of digital content continues to experience an unprecedented amount of change 
the expansion of network bandwidth  increased availability of devices that allow people to enjoy digital content  availability of digital content  and increased mobility are all helping to 
table of contents accelerate the market shift 
as part of this change  consumers are demanding high quality digital content in many formats and places 
users are also seeking flexible means by which to legally acquire and add content to their digital libraries permanently or for a period of time and want to be able to enjoy that content in numerous locations on different devices 
they want to easily discover and access content movies  music  photos  and programming and enjoy it where they want and when they want 
no matter what content consumers desire or are enjoying  video content remains key 
new devices and services are continually being created that bring video content to consumers 
consumers are in an upgrade cycle investing in high end hdtv s that maximize video enjoyment 
these devices require the ability to provide information identifying what is available to the viewer in broadcast television tv listings  stored or packaged video  and video on demand vod 
we refer to providing this information as guidance 
guidance becomes more complex as more sources of entertainment become available to consumers 
beyond existing pay tv options  consumers can now download or stream internet based content to their media devices  accessed via several different business models 
in addition  the current home media device infrastructure is very complex 
setting up such an environment requires integrating numerous devices  a deep understanding of the interoperability of media formats and creation of mechanisms for managing and enjoying content 
the alternative is to purchase products from a single vendor and sacrifice the ability to integrate all types of media into many devices or have many devices operating in silos  significantly limiting the mobility and flexibility that consumers desire 
these changes are impacting every part of the entertainment supply chain  from content producers  to distribution channels and consumption device manufacturers  causing them each to reevaluate their business models  as well as introducing new competitors at each phase of the supply chain 
in the case of content producers  the industry shift to digital media  pc based entertainment platforms  digital portable devices  networked devices  and internet downloads threatens current revenue models built on tightly controlled distribution windows that leaves content producers vulnerable to unauthorized use of their content 
inexpensive  easy to use in home copying devices  such as dvd recorders  and pc based hard drive recorders  enable consumers to make unauthorized copies of video  audio and software content 
content owners lose billions of dollars every year to casual copying and professional or bootleg piracy and internet peer to peer pp piracy 
as technological advances facilitate digital downloads and digital copying  motion picture studios  music labels  cable television and program distributors have become more concerned with how to protect their intellectual property  make it available to consumers in the manner they wish to receive it  and maintain their distribution windows 
distribution channels  such as cable and satellite operators  web portals and retailers  and others are all seeking ways to best retain their competitive advantage in a digital entertainment world 
they are requiring highly customizable solutions that aid the consumer experience  such as additional data about the entertainment content  while still allowing the distribution channel to retain its unique identity 
they are also seeking to increase their interaction with a consumer and create new revenue opportunities 
this requires substantial investment in technology infrastructure to augment their current businesses 
additionally  content producers are exploring new forms of distribution to protect or advance their position in the distribution window chain  which includes experimenting with direct to consumer models and new forms of content licensing  such as exclusive downloads  subscription to a studio s portfolio  or making a streamed or downloaded movie available for purchase simultaneous with the home video distribution window 
all of this results in increased competition for distributors  leading to their need to create unique distribution arrangements and to integrate with many partners to reach consumers 
the markets for consumer electronics ce manufacturers are also in major flux 
consumers are demanding capabilities to interact with broad ranges of media  not just viewing content that is broadcast to the device 
increased functionality requires extensive software to be embedded into these devices  which is not a core competency for ce manufacturers 
ce manufacturers also desire an ongoing revenue relationship with their customer  not just to sell them a new device every few years 
this leads to a demand for add on services or advertising that allow the ce manufacturer to profit from the on going distribution or maintenance of entertainment content 

table of contents as traditional media changes  the opportunities for advertisers evolve as well 
currently advertisers spend more heavily on television commercials than any other form of advertising 
as television viewership becomes more fragmented  advertisers have sought new ways to reach consumers 
additionally  the growth of web advertising has increased the criteria advertisers use to evaluate successful advertising  adding metrics such as personalization and guaranteed views 
rovi s markets we sell our products into the following market verticals i service providers cable  satellite  telecommunications  mobile and internet service providers among others  ii ce manufacturers  and iii other 
service providers ipgs an ipg is an interactive listing of television or video program information that enables viewers to navigate through  sort  select and schedule video programming for viewing and recording 
we believe that interactive video guidance technology is a necessary tool for television viewers bombarded with an increasing amount of available content and an increasing number of digital cable and satellite television channels  vod services  and internet download services 
the ipg is evolving from a guide to television to a guide for all the digital content that users have access to in the home or available to them on their tv  including programming delivered over the internet 
our service provider licensees either deploy ipgs provided by the company or  pursuant to an ipg patent license  their own ipg or a third party ipg 
for service providers that deploy one of our ipgs  we also offer operational support  content  professional services and data 
our ipgs allow service providers to customize certain elements of the ipgs for their subscribers and also allow these providers to upgrade  over time  the features and services they can offer to their subscribers 
our service provider ipgs are compatible with service providers subscription management  pay per view ppv and vod services 
our ipgs allow service providers to provide their viewers with current and future program information 
we currently offer ipgs marketed to service providers under the i guide  passport  passport echo  passport dct and passport truway brands 
in addition  in response to interest from service providers  we are currently investing in developing a totalguide solution for service providers see consumer electronics ipgs below 
the majority of our service provider ipgs also feature advertising 
we sell advertisers  often broadcasters  or their agencies the opportunity to promote their products via ads inserted in our guides 
we offer packages to advertisers to provide them nationwide or targeted advertising on a guide for a period of time 
advertisers place ads through a variety of display formats incorporated into the guide screens 
depending on the ipg deployed  advertisements can display additional text information or video when clicked on via the remote control 
our most recent guides even allow an ad for a specific television program to link directly to the tv channel it is on or allow consumers to program a recording or a reminder from the ad 
advertisers can target specific audiences by airing ads at certain times of the day or in specific geographies 
to demonstrate the value of this advertising  we began measuring usage and ad views by consumers for certain service provider guides deployed in the united states a click stream analysis in late we believe this information may enable us to increase our revenue from advertising by offering the advertiser evidence of the reach of a given ad or time slot 
service providers who have a patent license from us are not required to provide advertising in their ipg 
however  our agreements with domestic service providers generally require the sharing of advertising revenue if ipg advertising is provided 
service providers generally pay us a monthly per subscriber fee 
service providers in the online space generally pay us a fee based on unique users 
we have also entered into agreements with certain licensees that enable them to provide an ipg to an unlimited number of subscribers or unique users  provided they pay us a 
table of contents specified flat fee 
we also include in service provider revenues any revenue related to an ipg deployed by a service provider in a subscriber household whether the ultimate payment for that ipg comes from the service provider or from a manufacturer of a set top box 
we generally do not receive a license fee from manufacturers for set top boxes deployed by a cable or satellite provider  where that provider has also licensed our ipg technology 
our service provider customers include british sky broadcasting group  canal  charter  comcast corporation comcast  cox communications  directv  echostar communications  foxtel  megacable  sky deutschland  sky italia  shaw communications  time warner cable  upc  verizon  yahoo and others 
we also have license agreements with third party ipg providers such as motorola  nds  scientific atlanta and others 
the majority of subscribers for which we are paid a license fee are receiving an ipg pursuant to a patent license between us and the service provider or third party ipg provider 
as of december  approximately million subscribers worldwide are receiving a licensed or rovi provided ipg  including million internationally 
the company and comcast have a joint venture  guideworks llc guideworks  to develop i guide ipgs for the us cable industry 
we own of the joint venture and comcast owns  with comcast serving as the managing member 
comcast has the right to use the joint development products in connection with products and services comcast offers across its digital subscriber base 
we have the exclusive right to distribute the i guide to other multi channel video service providers 
we are currently in discussions with comcast to end the guideworks joint venture 
we believe having control of our ipg development will allow us to reduce overall ipg development costs 
content protection digital ppv vod services enable consumers to purchase and view movies and other programming in their homes through cable  satellite or internet based delivery systems 
as entertainment content producers explore the idea of simultaneous or more closely staged theatrical  dvd  and or ppv vod release of content  studios have realized the importance of content security in digital ppv vod networks because high quality vhs and dvd copies can be made from the source analog video signal 
many digital ppv vod system operators have implemented our content security capability in their digital set top boxes 
our solutions allow content owners to copy protect their ppv vod movies  while at the same time allowing consumers to store  move or share content  as long as it is done within the parameters defined by copyright owners 
for additional details on acp technology see content protection in the other section below 
cable and satellite television system operators pay us a one time license fee and or transaction based royalty payments i for the right to incorporate our video content security technology into their networks for ppv or vod services and ii when content security for digital ppv or vod programming is activated by them and content protected programs are purchased by subscribers 
consumer electronics ipgs we currently offer multiple ipgs to the ce industry  including those marketed under the g guide brand in japan  the guide plus brand in europe and the tv guide on screen brand in north america 
these ipgs are generally incorporated into mid to high end plasma  dlp and lcd televisions and blu ray or dvd hard drive recorder based products 
our ipgs generally deliver continuously updated multi day program listings to users  regardless of whether they receive their television signal via cable or over the air broadcast 
we use a variety of terrestrial  satellite and broadband internet transmission means to deliver listings data to our ipgs 
our ce ipg products also feature advertising 
some of our ce ipg product agreements require that we share a portion of this ipg advertising revenue with the ce manufacturer 
ce manufacturers who have a patent license from us are not required to provide advertising in their ipg 

table of contents our ce ipg licensees include devices distributed under the hitachi  lg  panasonic  mitsubishi  philips  pioneer  samsung  sharp  sony  vizio and other brands 
generally  our agreements enable our licensees to incorporate our ce ipg technology or utilize our ce ipg patents in specified products in certain territories provided we receive license fees based on the number of units produced and shipped that incorporate our technology or utilize our patents 
we have also entered into agreements with certain licensees that enable them to ship an unlimited number of units  provided they pay us a specified flat fee 
in the second quarter of the company plans to launch a new ipg which will be marketed under the totalguide brand in north america and europe 
totalguide is the company s next generation guide  expanding guidance and available content beyond a traditional ipg 
we believe totalguide will allow ce manufacturers to increase customer satisfaction by offering simple and intuitive access to multiple content types broadcast  premium  internet based and personal 
in addition  totalguide enhances the consumer experience through the tv guide database  extended multimedia and increased personalization options 
with search and recommendations technologies  totalguide guides consumers to find favorites and discover new content 
ce manufacturers can elect to deploy a full totalguide consisting of the broadcast  broadband and personal guides  or deploy selected components implemented via a professional services agreement 
an important element of totalguide is its ability to not only provide guidance to internet based content  but to also allow the consumer to view the internet based content they find 
to facilitate this activity  the company has relationships with on line content distributors  such as blockbuster  showtime  rhapsody and zilliontv  to make their content available via totalguide 
their content is then integrated with our database so that a consumer can search and access the media that content partner makes available for free  purchase or rental 
whether these relationships provide us with revenue depends on the content distributor as well as the company s agreement with ce manufacturers who then must determine which content distributor s services they desire to have integrated into their devices 
totalguide will also provide increased advertising options for both program promoters and conventional advertisers 
advertisements within totalguide will be selectable  allowing a more interactive experience  including commerce 
banner advertisements can be clicked on and a consumer can then access trailers  special offers and social media 
totalguide will also offer new forms of in grid advertising which can be inserted into the grid either in a row or into a cell 
once selected an interactive experience can be triggered 
in japan  interactive program guide inc ipg jv is our joint venture with dentsu inc and tokyo news service limited is the exclusive provider of program listings and advertising for our ipgs marketed under the g guide name 
we own of the ipg jv and have certain contractual rights with respect to the ongoing management of the ipg jv

vcr plus our vcr plus showview video plus in europe and g code in asia technology is an industry standard for setting the recording of television programming on vcrs and has been adopted by most major consumer electronics manufacturers 
vcr plus is offered internationally in over countries 
it is incorporated into vcrs and certain low priced dvrs and dvd recorders and enables consumers to record a television program by simply using a proprietary one to eight digit pluscode number 
revenues related to our vcr plus business have been steadily declining as manufacturers chose to incorporate more advanced forms of guidance  such as an ipg  in their digital products 
pluscode numbers are generated through a patented process developed by us and are printed next to television listings in newspapers and program guides worldwide 
other other includes our data solutions business and our business of licensing our content protection products and services to entertainment companies 
data solutions we offer music  television  movie  book  and video game metadata 
in addition  we catalog information on celebrities  awards  sports  and other data necessary to provide a robust set of metadata 
our television guidance information database includes unique data on more than million tv programs   movies  and searchable data on almost every tv show produced since our database also has information on approximately million music albums  million tracks  million books and  video games 
our data services are operated with systematic processes that are designed to ensure completeness and quality of the data as well as linking the relationships among the data elements 
the data services are broken into levels of data basic data such as artist  album  navigational data such as relationships between actor and other movies or television series  and editorial data such as actor biographies  television  movie or music reviews 
besides licensing the data to web properties or embedding the data in ce devices  the databases are also available via our web sites  specifically allmusic

we license a number of data and service offerings  including schedules  listings  tv supplements  and web services 
our data can be sold stand alone or as a complement to an ipg 
content protection motion pictures typically generate significant revenue from the sales of packaged media  primarily dvds 
any household that owns a dvd r  personal video recorder pvr  pc  or a media center  is capable of making unauthorized  high quality digital and analog copies unless that content is properly copy protected 
table of contents against this variety of threats 
as new distribution models evolve  including portability of video across devices  internet and other electronic distribution and the developing pc based home theater experience  solutions that protect the dvd from unauthorized copying are critical to preserving motion picture studio revenues 
as discussed above  our acp technologies allow consumers to view programming stored on prerecorded videocassettes and dvds or transmitted as digital pay per view or video on demand programs via cable or satellite  but deter unauthorized consumer copying of such programming on recordable dvd devices 
motion picture association of america mpaa and independent studios can use our video content security technology to protect movie releases on videocassette or dvd 
for the protection to work  acp must be present on both the media physical or digital and the hardware device 
studios are also releasing programming in the blu ray high definition dvd format blu ray 
blu ray includes a high level of protection implemented via bd technology 
for a device to be certified as blu ray enabled  it must have bd technology embedded within it and mpaa studios can license bd to take advantage of that embedded protection 
bd is designed to be self renewing  therefore inhibiting rippers from being able to create unauthorized copies of the dvd 
it is applied to the dvd at the time of manufacturing and interacts with elements of bd embedded in the blu ray player through the entire playback of the movie to ensure that it is an authorized copy 
this sophisticated protection increases the security of a blu ray dvd and is designed to result in a longer protection period for a title 
we sell directly to mpaa and independent studios 
content owners utilize our solutions to secure their content and thus ensure that the end customer pays them for the use of their content 
studios generally pay us an annual license fee to use our acp technology and generally pay us a per disc fee to license our bd technology 
our content security technology customers included the following companies buena vista home video  paramount pictures  twentieth century fox home entertainment and others 
rovi s growth strategy build upon key customer relationships

we will target existing customers and seek to expand the technologies we provide them  both now and in the future 
specifically  we will target existing ipg patent licensees and seek to sell them our ipg product 
we believe totalguide as well as other of our products are the types of products that makes this feasible 
we also believe that as the totalguide installed base increases  we can substantially grow our advertising revenue

we support our licensed duplicators and replicators with hardware and software installation assistance and quality assurance 
in addition  we support licensed duplicator replicator sales personnel by providing sales training and marketing literature  and by participating in trade shows 
intellectual property rights we operate in an industry in which innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success 
we protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means  including but not limited to applying for patent protection domestically and internationally 
as of december   we hold us patents and have us patent applications pending 
we also have  foreign patents issued and  foreign patent applications pending 
each of our u 
s issued patents will expire at a different time based on the particular filing date of that respective patent  with expiration dates as late as june competition ipgs there are a number of companies that produce and market ipgs as well as television schedule information in various other formats  that compete or we believe will compete with our ipg products and services 
these alternative formats include passive and interactive on screen electronic guide services  online listings  printed television guides in newspapers and weekly publications  and local cable television guides 
a common competitor we encounter is a customer who chooses to build its own ipg and license our intellectual property 
we believe that we provide a strong alternative to do it yourself  as we have products ready to be implemented and already have data distribution infrastructure and content as well as integration to third party services such as vod services for service providers 
we intend to build differentiation by integrating our products into a suite of products and services to provide solutions for our customers 
we believe our solutions can speed our customers time to market  be deployed at a lower cost than internally built products  and are superior to do it yourself products 
we have begun to see activity from web properties  such as yahoo and google  entering the ce market  namely embedded in tvs in north america 
while we today are working with them cooperatively  such web properties could offer competitive functionality in the future 

table of contents we believe improvements in software porting and in software substitutability  together with government mandated introduction of an open cable applications platform  will increasingly permit the creation of new guides and their quick placement in set top boxes both those purchased or leased from service providers and those purchased at retail 
many of our competitors and other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that may directly or indirectly affect the products or services offered or under development by us 
we are currently developing a variety of enhancements to our ipgs 
we cannot assure that any enhancements developed by us would not be found to infringe patents that are currently held or may be issued to others 
there can be no assurance that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services 
in addition  patent applications are generally confidential for a period of months from the filing date  or until a patent is issued in some cases  so we cannot evaluate the extent to which certain products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications prior to their publication 
in general  if one or more of our products or services were to infringe patents held by others  we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
this could have an affect on our ability to compete in the ipg marketplace 
content security technology our video content security solutions are proprietary and have broad us and international patent coverage 
we have an analog content security solution that has been widely deployed on commercial products that significantly distorts or inhibits copying by vhs vcrs  dvd recorders  and hard drive recorders 
currently  our video content security technology is embedded in nearly all dvd players and most digital set top boxes worldwide 
while it is possible that a competitive video content security technology could be developed and deployed  we believe it would take years for the competitive technology to be accepted by hardware manufacturers and embedded into the consumer electronic devices 
given the time this would take  it is unlikely any other analog content security technology would displace our content security infrastructure and our extensive video content security ecosystem 
the greatest competitive threat to our content security technology is content providers choosing not to copy protect their content 
with the increase in online content distribution over the internet  and with the continuing advance of digital content and high definition formats  our analog video content security solutions that protect standard definition content on optical media and digital ppv vod signals are viewed by some of our customers as being less important than the other digital and network content protection solutions 
as a result  other internet based digital content security or drm technologies may present significant competition to our video content security business  such as drm offerings by intertrust  microsoft  apple  realnetworks  contentguard  philips  ibm and sony 
the two forms of approved copy protection adopted by the blu ray disc association specification are aacs and bd 
aacs is required on all discs and we believe that bd is a stronger and more attractive copy protection option for studios 
the success of bd will be driven by whether the mpaa studios choose to apply it 
vcr plus system we are not aware of any product or service other than the vcr plus system that allows the user to program a vcr or low end dvd recorder by entering a numerical code 
however  several products and services on the market offer other simplified programming functions and thus compete with the vcr plus system 
such products and services include on screen program guides incorporating point and click recording capability  such as our ce ipg and third party ipgs 
in addition  some products  such as dvrs  permit consumers to record programs directly from air  cable or satellite for later viewing through the use of memory chips and hard disk drives contained in the devices or through remote record capability from an individuals computer 

table of contents data services in the database and data services area  we compete with other providers of entertainment related content data such as tribune media services  internet movie database imdb and gracenote 
while we do not believe that our competitors data sets are focused on exploration  discovery  and content management in the way that our data is  nor are they tightly tied to a portfolio of software to which they add significant value  they may present competition to our data services business 
media recognition technology in the recognition technology and ce manufacturer area  our primary competitor is gracenote  who provides media recognition technology as part of their cddb data set 
their core technology provides basic album and track metadata when a cd is inserted into a drive 
shazam entertainment also sells a music media recognition technology 
connected platform the competition for the connected platform are ce and set top box manufacturers developing their own capability and others such as twonky and digi on 
however  we believe the integration of standards and dlna reference status into the connected platform provides us with significant competitive advantages 
additional competitors consist of companies that focus on ce middleware and set top box software companies with ce middleware offerings 
legislative and regulatory actions a number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners 
the united states and other countries have adopted certain laws  including the digital millennium copyright act of  or dmca  and the european copyright directive  which are aimed at the prevention of piracy of content and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies  such as those covered by our patents 
vbi and digital data carriage matters we use the vertical blanking interval  or vbi  in the analog television signals of the local affiliates of major broadcast networks such as pbs through national datacast  abc  cbs  nbc and fox to supply updates throughout the day of program listing information to our tv guide on screen and guide plus branded consumer electronics devices in the united states 
we have agreements with cbs corporation cbs and national datacast  inc ndi which allow for the distribution of our ce ipg data over the digital broadcast signals of both cbs and ndi participating stations  following the installation of necessary equipment 
the fcc has ruled that it is within the discretion of a cable multiple system operator mso to retransmit or strip out data transmitted in the vbi lines of broadcast stations carried on that mso s system 
we have agreements with msos which provide for carriage of our program listing information in either the vbi or within the digital signal of broadcast television stations 
compatibility between cable systems and consumer electronic equipment the fcc has been working for over a decade to implement a congressional mandate that it create a competitive market for cable television set top boxes and other devices to access video programming on cable systems navigation devices and give consumers a choice in the device used to access such programming  while still allowing the cable systems to have control over the secured access to their systems 

table of contents to meet its statutory obligation without compromising the security of video services  the commission required cable systems to make available a security element now known as a cablecard separate from the basic navigation device needed to access video program channels 
in  the fcc adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators and consumer electronics manufacturers to facilitate the retail availability of so called plug and play devices that utilize unidirectional cablecards  including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a set top box but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content 
due to certain legislative developments in the us  cable subscribers may be able to utilize interactive and other two way services without the need for a set top box  meaning that consumers could use an ipg built directly into a tv to access and operate their cable subscriptions and not need to purchase or rent a set top box from the cable operator 
in an effort to ensure that cable operators adequately support cablecards  fcc regulations also prohibited multi channel video service providers except satellite providers from deploying after july  navigation devices with combined security and non security functions the integration ban 
both cable operators and consumer electronics manufacturers are required to use the same security solution 
further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and or demand for plug and play devices  particularly bi directional devices  and set top boxes  all of which could affect demand for ipgs incorporated in set top boxes or ce devices 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
of these employees  approximately were based outside of the united states 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any organized work stoppages 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon the continued service of our key employees and on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key employees and may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business in the future

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following risks 
this list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and deliver innovative technologies in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries  our business could decline 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution 
we will need to continue to expend considerable resources on research and development in the future in order to continue to design and deliver enduring  innovative entertainment products and technologies 
despite 
table of contents our efforts  we may not be able to develop and effectively market new products  technologies and services that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
in addition  we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities 
at times  such changes can be dramatic  such as the shift from vhs videocassettes to dvds for consumer playback of movies in homes and elsewhere  the anticipated shift to high definition dvd or the transition from packaged media to internet distribution 
the continued decline in worldwide shipments of vcrs has resulted in a decline in our vcr plus revenues over time  causing us to focus on growth in other parts of our business 
our future success depends to a great extent on our ability to develop and deliver innovative technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries and that are compatible with the technologies or products introduced by other entertainment industry participants 
despite our efforts and investments in developing new products  services and technologies we cannot assure you that the level of funding and significant resources we are committing for investments in new products  services and technologies will be sufficient or result in successful new products  services or technologies  we cannot assure you that our newly developed products  services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot assure you that any new products or services that we develop will achieve market acceptance  our products  services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences  and our competitors and or potential customers may develop products  services or technologies similar to those developed by us  resulting in a reduction in the potential demand for our newly developed products  services or technologies 
our failure to successfully develop new and improved products  services and technologies  including as a result of any of the risks described above  may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business results and financial condition 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  we could experience price reductions  fewer customers  reduced margins or loss of market share 
our ipgs face competition from companies that produce and market program guides as well as television schedule information in a variety of formats  including passive and interactive on screen electronic guide services  online listings  printed television guides in newspapers and weekly publications  and local cable television guides 
our ipg products also compete against customers who choose to build their own ipg and license our intellectual property 
in the connected device middleware and metadata marketplace  there is competition not only from other companies  but also from customer implemented internally developed solutions 
we believe that our dvd digital to analog copy protection and videocassette copy protection systems currently have limited competition 
it is possible  however  that alternative copy protection technologies could become competitive 
additionally  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of these areas 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we do  which could reduce demand for our products or render them obsolete 
increased competition would be likely to result in price reductions and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for consumer electronics devices incorporating our technologies 
we derive significant revenues from ce manufacturer license fees for our ipg and acp technologies based on the number of units shipped 
we do not manufacture hardware  but rather depend on the cooperation of ce 
table of contents manufacturers to incorporate our acp and ipg technologies into their products 
generally  our license agreements do not require manufacturers to include our technology in any specific number or percentage of units  and only a few of these agreements guarantee a minimum aggregate licensing fee 
purchases of new ce devices  including television sets  integrated satellite receiver decoders  dvrs  dvd recorders  personal computers and internet appliances are largely discretionary and may be adversely impacted by increasing market saturation  durability of products in the marketplace  new competing products  alternate consumer entertainment options and general economic trends in the countries or regions in which these products are offered 
as a result  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in sales of consumer electronics devices employing our technologies 
in addition  the decision by manufacturers to incorporate our ipg technology into their products is a function of what other guide technologies and products are available 
our future operating results may be adversely impacted as a result of consumer electronics manufacturers opting not to incorporate our technology into their devices as a result of other available alternatives 
dependence on the cooperation of msos and digital broadcast satellite dbs providers  television broadcasters  hardware manufacturers  publications  data providers and delivery mechanisms could adversely affect our revenues 
we rely on third party providers to deliver our ipg data to consumer electronics devices that include our ipg 
further  our national data network provides customized and localized listings to our ipg service for msos and dbs providers and licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos and dbs providers 
there can be no assurance that these delivery mechanisms will distribute the data without error or that the agreements that govern some of these relationships can be maintained on favorable economic terms 
to deliver our ipg data to consumer electronics devices  we have arrangements to carry our data in a part of the television signal called the vbi or its digital signal equivalent  of television stations included in the public broadcasting network  independently owned stations  and stations owned and operated by various station group owners 
we have historically only delivered our ipg data to consumer electronics devices through the vbi in analog broadcast signals 
in anticipation of the transition to digital transmission in the united states mandated by the fcc  we entered into agreements with cbs and ndi which allow for the distribution of our ce ipg data over the digital broadcast signals of both cbs and ndi participating stations  following the installation of necessary equipment 
the fcc has ruled that it is within the discretion of a cable mso to retransmit or strip out data transmitted in the vbi lines of broadcast stations carried on that mso s system 
we have agreements with msos which provide for carriage of our program listing information in either the vbi or within the digital signal of broadcast television stations 
we also rely on other arrangements in the united states  which are not long term  with other broadcasters for secondary carriage of our ipg data to consumer electronics devices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully renew or extend any of our existing carriage arrangements when they expire  or that renewals will be on terms that are as favorable to us as the arrangements currently in effect 
our inability to renew the existing arrangements on terms that are favorable to us  or enter into alternative arrangements that allow us to effectively transmit our ipg data to consumer electronics devices could have a material adverse effect on our ce ipg business 
our ipg data to ce devices broadcast through the vbi can be  and has been in the past in some markets  deleted or modified by some of the local service providers 
widespread deletion or modification of this data by service providers could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
to mitigate this risk in the united states  we have entered into agreements with many service providers to ensure that our ipg data to ce devices will not be deleted or modified by such systems 
additionally  cable companies in the united states are progressively moving their systems from an analog format to a digital format  which poses certain problems to 
table of contents the passage of our ipg data to ce devices carried in their signals 
solving such problems will require the cooperation of third parties such as the msos and hardware manufacturers  and may also require additional investment by us 
furthermore  in order for ce devices that incorporate our ipg to receive our data  such data must also be able to pass through any receivers through which such ce devices are receiving television programming signals 
even if our ipg data is passed to cable subscribers through cable networks by the service providers  there is a risk that the cable set top boxes deployed by such subscribers can impede the passage of our ipg data to ce devices 
widespread impedance of our ipg data to ce devices in any of the manners set forth above could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
we are currently making significant investments in the united states  europe and japan to build the capability to provide our program listings information via digital broadcast signals to support the next generation of products from our manufacturing partners 
this involves in some cases deploying equipment to aggregate and insert listings data  and securing bandwidth in digital broadcast streams to deliver that data 
if we are unable to complete this digital delivery build out in each of our regions in time to meet the planned deployment of the next generation of digital broadcast reliant ce devices  this could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
we deliver our data to our ipg service for msos and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos via satellite transmission  among other means 
while we have built in certain redundancies in our data delivery operation  a third party provides us with satellite capacity to transmit our data to our ipg service for certain msos and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos 
our arrangement with the third party provider may be terminated on little or no notice 
in the event that a provider of satellite capacity elects not to provide this capacity to transmit our data  there can be no assurance that all of our customers who currently receive our data via such provider will be able to receive our data via alternative means without significant delay or additional cost to us 
in the event that such provider elects not to transmit our data  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  we purchase some of our program guide information from commercial vendors 
the quality  accuracy and timeliness of that data may not continue to meet our standards or be acceptable to consumers 
the effects of the global recession may impact our business  operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
the global recession has caused a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other foreign governments  decreased consumer confidence  overall slower economic activity and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  these macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial condition or liquidity in a number of ways 
for example  if the economic downturn makes it difficult for our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  they may cause them to delay  decrease or cancel purchases of our solutions or reduce production of their products 
as many of our solutions are licensed on a per unit fee basis  our customers decision to decrease production of their products or devices may decrease our licensing revenue and adversely impact our operating results 
furthermore  as our customers face a weak economy  they may not be able to gain sufficient credit in a timely manner  which could result in an impairment of their ability to place orders with us or to make timely payments to us for previous purchases 
if this occurs  our revenue may be reduced  thereby having a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  we may be forced to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding may increase  which would have a negative impact on our cash position  liquidity and financial condition 
we cannot predict the timing or the duration of this or any other economic downturn in the economy and we are not immune to the effects of general worldwide economic conditions 

table of contents in addition  financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations  investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions  or financing activities including the timing and amount of any repurchases of our common stock or debt we may make in the future 
our investment portfolio  which includes short term debt securities  is generally subject to general credit  liquidity  counterparty  market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis 
if the banking system or the fixed income  credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
finally  like other stocks  our stock price can be affected by the global economic uncertainties and if investors have concerns that our business  operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn  our stock price could decrease 
if the volatility of credit market conditions continues or increases  it could adversely impact our investments and as a result  our liquidity 
the credit markets have experienced liquidity issues and failed auctions in the auction rate securities market 
the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade at auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
we have recorded unrealized losses related to our available for sale auction rate securities to accumulated other comprehensive income due to temporary declines in fair value and have classified all available for sale auction rate securities as long term marketable investments on our balance sheet 
if there are future unsuccessful auctions  the fair value of these auction rate securities may continue to decline 
the decline in fair value of our available for sale auction rate securities may become other than temporary and we may incur impairment charges in connection with these securities which would adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with our changing technology base through strategic acquisitions  investments and divestitures 
we have expanded our technology base in the past through strategic acquisitions and investments in companies with complementary technologies or intellectual property and intend to do so in the future 
acquisitions hold special challenges in terms of successful integration of technologies  products and employees 
in addition to the acquisition of gemstar in may  over the last several years we completed the divestitures of our tv guide magazine business december  our software business april  our games business april  our emeta business november  our tvg network business january and our tv guide network and tv guide online businesses february 
we also completed the acquisitions of mediabolic  inc january and all media guide holdings  inc december and the acquisition of the assets of cryptography research  inc november and muze  inc april 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures or the benefits of any other acquisitions we have completed or may complete in the future  and we may not be able to incorporate any acquired services  products or technologies with our existing operations  or integrate personnel from the acquired businesses  in which case our business could be harmed 
acquisitions  divestitures and other strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems integrating and divesting the operations  technologies  personnel or products over geographically disparate locations  unanticipated costs  litigation and other contingent liabilities  continued liability for pre closing activities of divested businesses or certain post closing liabilities which we may agree to assume as part of the transaction in which a particular business is divested  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering into markets in which we have no  or limited  prior experience  incurrence of significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful  
table of contents significant diversion of management s attention from our core business and diversion of key employees time and resources  inability to retain key customers  distributors  vendors and other business partners of the acquired business  and potential loss of our key employees or the key employees of an acquired organization 
financing for future acquisitions may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate for any of our businesses  we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully  finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or employees into our existing business and operations 
future acquisitions and divestitures may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause the value of our stock to fall 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition or divestiture in the future  and our senior secured credit facility and the indenture related to the notes impose some restrictions on our ability to make and finance additional acquisitions or divestitures 
if we acquire businesses  new products or technologies in the future  we may incur significant acquisition related costs 
divestitures could cause similar problems to occur 
in addition  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and we may record significant amounts of goodwill that will be subject to annual testing for impairment 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to write off all or part of one or more of these investments that could harm our operating results 
if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be significantly diluted 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisition activities could also cause operating margins to fall depending upon the financial models of the businesses acquired 
our strategic investments may involve joint development  joint marketing  or entry into new business ventures  or new technology licensing 
any joint development efforts may not result in the successful introduction of any new products by us or a third party  and any joint marketing efforts may not result in increased demand for our products 
further  any current or future strategic acquisitions and investments by us may not allow us to enter and compete effectively in new markets or enhance our business in our existing markets and we may have to write off our equity investments in companies as we have done in the past 
covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants  our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability and or our restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  make loans  investments and capital expenditures  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and consolidate or merge with or into  or sell substantially all of our assets to  another person 

table of contents in addition  our senior secured credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may be unable to meet those tests 
in addition  we have historically had less debt with fewer covenants 
if we fail to maintain effective internal controls to comply with these covenants  we may be in breach 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit facility and or our other indebtedness 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens 
if the lenders under our senior secured credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our senior secured credit facility and our other indebtedness 
our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are  and are expected to continue to be  at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income would decrease 
we have indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
as of december   we had total debt from continuing operations of approximately million  of which million of borrowings are under our senior secured credit facility and million of convertible notes 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the notes and our other indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting its operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  or to sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to 
table of contents meet our debt service and other obligations 
our credit agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets  use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our indebtedness 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 
rovi corporation s subsidiaries  including rovi solutions corporation formerly known as macrovision corporation and rovi guides corporation formerly known as gemstar tv guide international  own a significant portion of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations 
accordingly  repayment of our indebtedness is dependent  to a significant extent  on the generation of cash flow by the subsidiaries  including rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides  and their ability to make such cash available to us  by dividend  debt repayment or otherwise 
unless they are guarantors or a co issuer of our indebtedness  our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose 
our subsidiaries may not be able to  or may not be permitted to  make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness 
each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and  under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries 
in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries  we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
despite our current level of indebtedness  we may still be able to incur more indebtedness 
this could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of our credit agreements and indentures limit  but do not prohibit  us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with existing indebtedness  the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of our existing debt obligations in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of us 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations  may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by changes in the amount of revenue or earnings that we derive from international sources in countries with high or low statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
in addition  federal  state  and foreign tax jurisdictions may examine our income tax returns  including income tax returns of acquired companies and acquired tax attributes included therein 
we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in making such assessments  we exercise judgment in estimating our provision for income taxes 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination from these examinations will not be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
any adverse outcome from these examinations may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce proprietary solutions for digital content and technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be challenged and invalidated or circumvented 
our patents 
table of contents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in all countries where products incorporating our technologies can be sold 
we have filed applications to expand our patent claims and for improvement patents to extend the current expiration dates  however  expiration of some of our patents may harm our business 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property  our business would be harmed 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies or design around our patents 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of processes and devices that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult  and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies 
such competitive threats could harm our business 
we may be subject to legal liability for the provision of third party products  services or content 
we periodically enter into arrangements to offer third party products  services  content or advertising under our brands or via distribution on our websites or in our products or service offerings 
for example  we license or incorporate certain entertainment metadata into our data offerings 
we may be subject to claims concerning these products  services  content or advertising by virtue of our involvement in marketing  branding  broadcasting or providing access to them 
our agreements with these parties may not adequately protect us from these potential liabilities 
it is also possible that  if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users  third parties could make claims against us  including  for example  claims for intellectual property infringement 
investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive  even if the claims do not result in liability 
if any of these claims results in liability  we could be required to pay damages or other penalties  which could harm our business and our operating results 
we may initiate patent infringement or patent interference actions or other litigation to protect our intellectual property  which could be costly and harm our business 
we are currently engaged in litigation  and litigation may be necessary in the future  to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we  and many of our current and potential competitors  dedicate substantial resources to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
we believe that companies will continue to take steps to protect their technologies  including  but not limited to  seeking patent protection 
companies in the technology and content related industries have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights 
disputes regarding the ownership of technologies and their associated rights are likely to arise in the future and we may be forced to litigate to determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights 
any such litigation could be very costly  could distract our management from focusing on operating our business  and might ultimately be unsuccessful 
the existence and or outcome of such litigation could harm our business 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation  which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
from time to time we receive claims and inquiries from third parties alleging that our internally developed technology  technology we have acquired or technology we license from third parties may infringe other third parties proprietary rights  especially patents 
third parties have also asserted and most likely will continue to assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights  trademark rights or other proprietary rights  or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights 
we could be required to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves against such claims 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  or stop distributing our products and services while we re engineer them or seek licenses to necessary technology  which might not be available on reasonable terms or 
table of contents at all 
we could also be subject to claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims made against our customers  strategic partners or the current owners of businesses that we divested  which could increase our defense costs and potential damages 
for example  we have received notices and lawsuits from certain customers requesting indemnification in patent related lawsuits 
we evaluate the requests and assess whether we believe we are obligated to provide such indemnification to such customers on a case by case basis 
customers or strategic partners making such requests could become unwilling or hesitant to do business with us if we decline such requests 
an adverse determination with respect to such requests or in any of these events described above could require us to change our business practices and have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
litigation could harm our business and result in substantial settlement or related costs  including indemnification of customers  diversion of management and technical resources  either our customers discontinuing to use or ourselves discontinuing to sell infringing products  our expending significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and our obtaining licenses to infringed technology 
we are involved in the business of powering the discovery and enjoyment of digital entertainment  including over the internet 
there has been  and we believe that there will continue to be  an increasing level of litigation to determine the applicability of current laws to  and impact of new technologies on  the use and distribution of content over the internet and through new devices 
as we develop products and services that protect  provide or enable the provision of content in such ways  the risk of litigation against us may increase 
for our business to succeed  we need to attract and retain qualified employees and manage our employee base effectively 
our success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified employees and to manage our employee base effectively 
because of the specialized nature of our business  our future success will depend upon our continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain other highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel  particularly as we enter new markets 
competition for people with the skills that we require is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and los angeles where we have significant operations  and the high cost of living in these areas makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
establishing and maintaining licensing relationships with companies are important to build and support a worldwide entertainment technology licensing ecosystem and to expand our business  and failure to do so could harm our business prospects 
our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain licensing relationships with companies in related business fields  including dvd authoring facilities  mastering houses and replicators  dvd authoring tools software companies and replicator test equipment suppliers  dvd hardware manufacturers  semiconductor and equipment manufacturers  operators of entertainment content distributors  including ppv and vod networks  consumer electronics  digital ppv vod set top hardware manufacturers  and pc manufacturers  drm suppliers  and internet portals and other digital distribution companies 

table of contents substantially all of our license agreements are non exclusive  and therefore our licensees are free to enter into similar agreements with third parties  including our competitors 
our licensees may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
some of our third party license arrangements will require that we license others technologies and or integrate our solutions with others 
in addition  we rely on third parties to report usage and volume information to us 
delays  errors or omissions in this information could harm our business 
if these third parties choose not to support integration efforts or delay the integration  our business could be harmed 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with a broad range of participants throughout the entertainment industry  including motion picture studios  broadcasters and manufacturers of ce products  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 
relationships have historically played an important role in the entertainment industries that we serve 
if we fail to maintain and strengthen these relationships  these entertainment industry participants may not purchase and use our technologies  which could materially harm our business and prospects 
in addition to directly providing a substantial portion of our revenue  these relationships are also critical to our ability to have our technologies adopted as industry standards 
moreover  if we fail to maintain our relationships  or if we are not able to develop relationships in new markets in which we intend to compete in the future  including markets for new technologies and expanding geographic markets  our business  operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if major industry participants form strategic relationships that exclude us  our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
it may be more difficult for us  in the future  to have our technologies adopted as individual industry standards if entertainment industry participants collaborate on the development of new or different industry standard technologies 
increasingly  standards setting organizations are adopting or establishing technology standards for use in a wide range of ce products 
as a result  it is more difficult for individual companies to have their technologies widely adopted as an informal industry standard 
in addition  there are a large number of companies  including companies that typically compete against one another  involved in the development of new technologies for use in consumer entertainment products 
as a result  these companies often license their collective intellectual property rights as a group  making it more difficult for any single company to have its technologies adopted widely as a de facto industry standard or to have its technologies adopted as an exclusive  explicit industry standard 
examples of this include mpeg la drm licensing  blu ray dvd high definition dvd format  and digital living network alliance dlna and the universal plug and play upnp forum interoperability of consumer electronics devices 
if our technologies are not supported by these standards bodies or patent pools  it may be more difficult for us to grow our business in the future 
our major customers may have a large influence on industry standards and the widespread adoption of new technologies 
the selection of alternative technologies to ours or to those on which our technologies operate would harm our business 
continued consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry could adversely affect existing agreements 
we have entered into agreements with a large number of cable msos and dbs providers for the licensing or distribution of our technology  products and services 
if consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry continues  some of these agreements may be affected by mergers  acquisitions or system swaps 
we cannot assure you that any measures that we have taken to protect us against any negative consequences resulting from those transactions will be effective 
also  a service provider that files a bankruptcy petition or otherwise restructures or liquidates could avoid its future obligations and discharge its past payment obligations under the agreement in some circumstances 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenue we receive under these agreements 

table of contents the markets for our data solutions and ipg advertising may not develop and we may fail in our ability to fully exploit these new opportunities if these markets do not develop as we anticipate 
the market for ipg advertising is at an early stage of development and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our efforts to develop ipg advertising as an advertising medium widely accepted by consumers and advertisers 
in addition  mso  dbs and internet protocol television  or iptv  providers who have a patent license from us are not required to provide advertising in their ipg 
therefore our ability to derive advertising revenues from ipgs distributed by our patent licensees is also dependent on the implementation of ipg advertising by such licensees 
likewise  the market for our data solutions is at an early stage and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in growing our data business to the levels we anticipate 
limitations on control of joint ventures may adversely impact our operations 
we hold our interests in certain businesses  including guideworks and ipg inc  as a joint venture or in partnership with nonaffiliated third parties 
as a result of such arrangements  we may be unable to control the operations  strategies and financial decisions of such joint venture or partnership entities which could in turn result in limitations on our ability to implement strategies that we may favor  or to cause dividends or distributions to be paid 
in addition  our ability to transfer our interests in businesses owned with third parties is limited under certain joint venture  partnership or similar agreements 
we have limited control over existing and potential customers and licensees decisions to include our technology in their product offerings 
in general  we are dependent on our customers and licensees including producers and distributors of content for films and videos to incorporate our technology into their products 
although we have license agreements with many of these companies  many of these license agreements do not require any minimum purchase commitments  or are on a non exclusive basis  or do not require incorporation of our technology in their products 
if our customers were to determine that the benefits of our technology do not justify the cost of licensing the technology  then demand for our technology would decline 
furthermore  while we may be successful in obtaining mandatory status for our technology in one or more industry standards  there is no guarantee that products associated with these standards will be successful in the market 
our licensees and other manufacturers might not utilize our technology in the future 
if this were to occur  our business would be harmed 
our operating results may fluctuate  which may cause us to not be able to sustain our revenue levels or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis which may cause our common stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may experience volatility in revenues which may cause us to not be able to sustain our revenue levels  or our rate of revenue growth  on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  we may be required to delay or extend recognition of revenue on more complex licensing arrangements as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
fluctuations in our operating results have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  the price of our common stock to decline 
other factors that could affect our operating results include the acceptance of our technologies by system operators and ce manufacturers  expenses related to  and the financial impact of  possible acquisitions of other businesses and the integration of such businesses  the timing and ability of signing high value licensing agreements during a specific period  the potential that we may not be in a position to anticipate a decline in revenues in any quarter until i late in the quarter due to the closing of new sales agreements late in the quarter or ii after the quarter ends due to the delay inherent in reporting from certain licensees  
table of contents the extent to which new content technologies or formats replace technologies to which our solutions are targeted  and adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other major economies in which we do business as a result of the threat of terrorism  military actions taken by the united states or its allies  or generally weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions 
our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate depending upon when we receive royalty reports from certain licensees 
we recognize a portion of our license revenue only after we receive royalty reports from our licensees regarding the manufacture of their products that incorporate our technologies 
as a result  the timing of our revenue is dependent upon the timing of our receipt of those reports  some of which are not delivered until late in the quarter or after the end of the quarter 
this may put us in a position of not being able to anticipate a decline in revenues in any given quarter 
in addition  it is not uncommon for royalty reports to include corrective or retroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time 
furthermore  there have been times in the past when we have recognized an unusually large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee in a given quarter because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods 
this can result in a large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee being recorded in a given quarter that is not necessarily indicative of the amounts of licensing revenue to be received from that licensee in future quarters  thus causing fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sales 
economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with our international business could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect that international and export sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future growth will depend to a large extent on worldwide acceptance and deployment of our solutions 
to the extent that foreign governments impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology or components from the united states  the demand for our solutions in these markets could diminish 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies 
such laws also may not be conducive to copyright protection of digital content  which may make our content protection technology less effective and reduce the demand for it 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  changes in  or imposition of  foreign laws and regulatory requirements  changes in  or weakening of copyright and intellectual property patent laws  difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers and restrictions  fluctuations in our net effective income tax rate driven by changes in the percentage of revenues that we derive from international sources  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic condition  including changes resulting from the threat of terrorism  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents our business could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop  if we do not receive additional orders to supply our technologies or products for use by foreign system operators  ce manufacturers and ppv vod providers or if regulations governing our international businesses change 
any changes to the statute or the regulations with respect to export of encryption technologies could require us to redesign our products or technologies or prevent us from selling our products and licensing our technologies internationally 
we have made and expect to make significant investments in infrastructure which  if ineffective  may adversely affect our business results 
we have made and expect to make significant investments in infrastructure  tools  systems  technologies and content  including initiatives relating to digital asset and rights management and data warehouses  aimed to create  assist in the development or operation of  or enhance our ability to deliver innovative products and services across multiple media  digital and emerging platforms 
these investments may ultimately cost more than is anticipated  their implementation may take longer than expected and they may not meaningfully contribute to or result in successful new or enhanced products  services or technologies 
some terms of our agreements with licensees could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect licensing revenue payable to us under those agreements 
some of our license agreements contain most favored nation clauses 
these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another licensee on more favorable terms  we must offer some of those terms to our existing licensees 
we have entered into a number of license agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements 
these agreements may obligate us to provide different  more favorable  terms to licensees  which could  if applied  result in lower revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation terms included in our license agreements  these contracts are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that  if correct  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our products could be susceptible to errors  defects  or unintended performance problems that could result in lost revenues  liability or delayed or limited market acceptance 
we develop and offer complex solutions  which we license to customers 
the performance of these products typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
due to the complexity of these products offered and developed  and despite our quality assurance testing  the products may contain undetected defects or errors that may affect the proper use or application of such products by the customer 
because our products are embedded in digital content and other software  our solutions performance could unintentionally jeopardize our customers product performance 
any such defects  errors  or unintended performance problems in existing or new products  and any inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner  could result in loss of revenue or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs and increased service  any of which could materially harm our business 
in addition  we rely on the customer and third party replicators to properly use our products to protect the software and applications to which our technology may be applied 
any improper use or application of the software by the customer or the third party replicators may render our technologies useless and result in losses from claims arising out of such improper use of the products 
because customers rely on our products as used in their software and applications  defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products 

table of contents these defects or errors could also result in product liability or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from these claims through warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability clauses in our agreements  these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance 
furthermore  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance may not adequately cover these claims 
if a court refused to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  our business could be materially harmed 
in protecting copyrights and other intellectual property rights of our customers  our products affect consumer use of our customers products 
consumers may view this negatively and discontinue or threaten to discontinue purchase or use of our customers products unless our customers stop using our technologies 
this may cause a decline in demand for our products or legal actions against us by our customers or consumers 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to pervasive federal regulation  including fcc licensing and other requirements 
these industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
while these regulations do not apply directly to us  they affect cable television providers and other multi channel video programming distributors  or mvpds  which are the primary customers for certain of our products and services 
fcc regulations prohibit mvpds except dbs providers from deploying after july  consumer electronic navigation devices eg  set top boxes with combined security and non security functions the integration ban 
the fcc has granted a number of requests for waiver of the integration ban  and denied several petitions for waivers or deferrals 
petitions for reconsideration of the decisions denying waivers are pending before the fcc 
resolution of these petitions and other fcc action with respect to these issues could affect demand for ipgs incorporated into set top boxes or ce devices 
legislative initiatives seeking to weaken copyright law or new governmental regulation or new interpretation of existing laws that cause resulting legal uncertainties could harm our business 
consumer rights advocates and other constituencies continuously challenge copyright law  notably the us digital millennium copyright act of  or dmca  through both legislative and judicial actions 
legal uncertainties surrounding the application of the dmca may adversely affect our business 
if copyright law is compromised  or devices that can circumvent our technology are permitted by law and become prevalent  this could result in reduced demand for our technologies  and our business would be harmed 
many laws and regulations are pending and may be adopted in the united states  individual states and local jurisdictions and other countries with respect to the internet 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including copyright and other intellectual property rights  digital rights management  property ownership and taxation 
these types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulations 
in addition  state and local governments may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
changes to or the interpretation of these laws could increase our costs  expose us to increased litigation risk  substantial defense costs and other liabilities or require us or our customers to change business practices 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  could materially and adversely affect our business 
business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 
the provision of certain of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of communications and transmission systems and mechanisms  including satellite  cable  wire  over the air broadcast communications and transmission systems and mechanisms 
these communication and transmission 
table of contents systems and mechanisms are subject to significant risks and any damage to or failure of these systems and mechanisms could result in an interruption of the provision of our products and services 
several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  and other events beyond our control 
the majority of our research and development activities  our corporate headquarters  our principal information technology systems  and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man made disaster that disrupts our business 
the communications and transmission systems and mechanisms that we depend on are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities 
our telephone and computer networks are subject to security and stability risks that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to litigation or liability 
online business activities depend on the ability to transmit confidential information and licensed intellectual property securely over private and public networks 
any compromise of our ability to transmit such information and data securely or reliably  and any costs associated with preventing or eliminating such problems  could harm our business 
online transmissions are subject to a number of security and stability risks  including our own or licensed encryption and authentication technology  and access and security procedures  may be compromised  breached or otherwise be insufficient to ensure the security of customer information or intellectual property  we could experience unauthorized access  computer viruses  system interference or destruction  denial of service attacks and other disruptive problems  whether intentional or accidental  that may inhibit or prevent access to our websites or use of our products and services  someone could circumvent our security measures and misappropriate our  our partners or our customers proprietary information or content or interrupt operations  or jeopardize our licensing arrangements  which are contingent on our sustaining appropriate security protections  our computer systems could fail and lead to service interruptions or down time for our ecommerce web sites  or we may need to grow  reconfigure or relocate our data centers in response to changing business needs  which may be costly and lead to unplanned disruptions of service 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business  hurt our ability to distribute products and services and collect revenue  threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology  harm our reputation  and expose us to litigation or liability 
because some of our technologies and businesses are intended to inhibit use of or restrict access to our customers intellectual property  we may become the target of hackers or other persons whose use of or access to our customers intellectual property is affected by our technologies 
we may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches  hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  attacks or failures 
our internet based product and service offerings rely on a variety of systems  networks and databases  many of which are maintained by us at our data centers 
we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and we do not maintain real time back up of our data  so in the event of significant system disruption  particularly during peak periods  we could experience loss of data processing capabilities  which could cause us to lose customers and could harm our operating results 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect against down time for products and services  we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 
in order to provide our internet based products and services  we must protect the security of our systems  networks  databases and software 

table of contents if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired  which could increase our operating costs and affect our ability to operate our business 
we have a complex business that is international in scope 
ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help ensure that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
we are continually in the process of documenting  reviewing and  if appropriate  improving our internal controls and procedures in connection with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we or our independent registered public accountants identify areas for further attention or improvement  implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors  officers and employees  entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems  and take a significant period of time to complete 
we have in the past identified  and may in the future identify  significant deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls  which have been or will in the future need to be remediated 
furthermore  our independent registered public accountants may interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from how we interpret them  or our independent registered public accountants may not be satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which these controls are documented  operated or reviewed in the future 
finally  in the event we make a significant acquisition  or a series of smaller acquisitions  we may face significant challenges in implementing the required processes and procedures in the acquired operations 
as a result  our independent registered public accountants may decline or be unable to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or may issue a qualified report in the future 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to investors perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements 
we will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant legal  accounting and other expenses associated with corporate governance and public company reporting requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules implemented by the sec and nasdaq 
as long as the sec requires the current level of compliance for public companies of our size  we expect these rules and regulations to require significant legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities time consuming and costly 
these rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage than was previously available 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
we may be subject to assessment of sales and other taxes for the sale of our products  license of technology or provision of services 
we do not currently collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our products  license of technology or provision of services in states and countries other than those in which we have offices or employees 
our business would be harmed if one or more states or any foreign country required us to collect sales or other taxes from past sales of products  licenses of technology or provision of services  particularly because we would be unable to go back to customers to collect sales taxes for past sales and would likely have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 

table of contents the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  new products or new contracts  announcements by competitors or their customers  announcements by our customers  governmental regulatory and copyright action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  announcements regarding acquisitions or divestitures  announcements regarding litigation or regulatory matters  changes in financial estimates or coverage by securities analysts  changes in interest rates which affect the value of our investment portfolio  changes in tax law or the interpretation of tax laws  and general market conditions 
announcements by satellite television operators  cable television operators  major content providers or others regarding consumer electronics business combinations  evolving industry standards  consumer rights activists wins in government regulations or the courts  motion picture production or distribution or other developments could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
there can be no assurance that our historic trading prices and price earnings ratios  or those of technology companies in general  will be sustained 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  some companies have been named in class action suits 
further  the general stock market instability and economic uncertainty may adversely affect the global financial markets  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
we utilize non gaap reporting in our quarterly earnings press releases 
we publish non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases along with a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to those measures compiled in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the reconciling items have adjusted gaap net income and gaap earnings per share for certain non cash  non operating or non recurring items and are described in detail in each such quarterly earnings press release 
we believe that this presentation may be more meaningful to investors in analyzing the results of operations and income generation as this is how our business is managed 
the market price of our stock may fluctuate based on future non gaap results if investors base their investment decisions upon such non gaap financial measures 
if we decide to curtail use of non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases  the market price of our stock could be affected if investors analyze our performance in a different manner

item legal proceedings the company is involved in legal proceedings related to intellectual property rights and other matters 
the following legal proceedings include those of the company and its subsidiaries 
indemnifications directv  inc v 
finisar corporation 
in april  gemstar received a notice of a potential claim for indemnification from directv group  inc directv as a result of a lawsuit filed by finisar corporation finisar against directv in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
finisar alleged that several aspects of the directv satellite transmission system  including aspects of its advanced electronic program guide epg and the storage  scheduling  and transmission of data for the epg  infringed a finisar patent 
on july   the court awarded finisar approximately million 
in addition  the court ordered directv to pay approximately per activated set top box in licensing fees going forward in lieu of an injunction until the expiration of finisar s patent in the parties both filed appeals to the federal circuit  which subsequently ruled that the trial court s construction of certain terms of the patent was too broad  vacated the jury s verdict of infringement  held that one of the seven patent claims at issue is invalid  and left standing the remaining six claims for reconsideration by the trial court 
the appeals court also reversed the jury s finding that directv s infringement was willful 
the trial court subsequently ruled in directv s favor on its summary judgment motion that the remaining claims of the subject patent were invalid  and in january the court of appeals confirmed that ruling 
the company has not established a reserve with respect to this matter in its consolidated financial statements 
comcast cable communications corp  llc v 
finisar corporation  in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
in support of a potential claim for indemnification  comcast cable communications corp  llc comcast put the company on notice that it had received communications from finisar asserting infringement of us patent  the patent 
on july   comcast filed a declaratory judgment action in the northern district of california asking the court to rule  among other things  that it does not infringe the patent and or that the patent is invalid 
on may   finisar entered into a 
table of contents covenant and stipulation with comcast  filed with the california court  that it would not assert any claim of the patent against comcast or certain related entities  other than claim on july   the court ruled on comcast s summary judgment motion  finding that claim is invalid  and therefore finding that comcast s non infringement motion is moot 
comcast has not taken any further action insofar as its potential indemnity claim against the company is concerned

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  equity based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our continuing business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonable assured 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for 
table of contents multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services and to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
we license our proprietary ipg technology to ce manufacturers and to service providers 
we generally recognize revenue from ipg product and patent licensing on a per unit shipped model with ce manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our recognition of revenues from per unit license fees is based on units reported shipped by the manufacturer 
ce manufacturers normally report their unit shipments to us in the quarter immediately following that of actual shipment by the licensee 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the period the services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
revenues from annual or other license fees are recognized based on the specific terms of the license arrangement 
for instance  certain ipg licensees enter into agreements for which they have the right to ship an unlimited number of units over a specified term for a flat fee 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
we often enter into ipg patent license agreements in which we provide a licensee a release for past infringement as well as the right to ship an unlimited number of units over a future period for a flat fee 
in this type of arrangement  we generally are not able to provide objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the go forward license arrangement the undelivered element and therefore would recognize all revenue for such agreement ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenues from licensing our acp technology are often generated from licensing agreements that pay a per unit royalty fee for the shipment of dvds and the shipment of digital set top boxes 
we rely on royalty reports from customers and or third parties as the basis for revenue recognition  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement and that collection of a fixed and determinable fee is considered probable 
we have established significant experience and relationships with certain customers to reasonably estimate current period volume for purposes of making an accurate revenue accrual 
accordingly  royalty revenue from these customers is recognized as earned 
revenue from other customers is recognized as reported until such time that the company can establish a basis for making reasonable estimates  in which case revenue is recognized on an as earned basis 
licensees generally report activity within to days after the end of the month or quarter in which such activity takes place 
any unusual or unanticipated volumes in a particular period can add significant fluctuations on the revenue reported 
we have also entered into agreements with certain entertainment studios for which they have the right to ship an unlimited number of dvds that utilize our acp technology over a specified term for a flat fee 
we record the revenue associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
in addition  we also enter into agreements with ce manufacturers in which they pay us a one time fee for a perpetual license to our acp technology 
provided that collectability is reasonable assured  we record revenue related to these agreements when the agreement is executed as we have no continuing obligation and the amounts are fixed and determinable 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable on an account by account basis 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation  and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents equity based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant is determined by using an option pricing model using a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility in market traded options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our equity based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our equity based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those equity based payments in the future 
certain equity based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
classification and fair value measurement of auction rate securities we hold investments in auction rate securities having contractual maturities of greater than one year and interest rate reset features of between and days 
these auction rate securities were priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature 
as a result of recent adverse conditions in the financial markets  the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model rather than at par 
these analyses are highly judgmental and consider  among other items  the likelihood of redemption  credit quality  duration  insurance wraps and expected future cash flows 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
temporary declines in fair value for our available for sale auction rate securities  which we attribute to market liquidity issues rather than credit issues  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
any future fluctuation in fair value related to these instruments that we deem to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we determine that any future valuation adjustment is other than temporary  we will record a charge to earnings as appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in connection with our impairment analysis performed annually in our fourth quarter  we are required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
to accomplish this  we are required to determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing 
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach and a market based approach 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts and discount rates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and would no longer be depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes using the cumulative probability method 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amount provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operations are financed primarily from cash generated by operations 
continuing operating activities provided net cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased from the prior year primarily due to the gemstar acquisition 
the availability of cash generated by operations in the future could be affected by other business risks including  but not limited to  those factors set forth under the caption risk factors

as of december   million was outstanding 
the term loan is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries  and the assets and shares of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral against the term loan 
we are required to use the proceeds from asset sales of million or more to pay down the term loan  proceeds from assets sales of less than million may be retained for investment in fixed or capital assets 
beginning in  the company is required to make a payment on the term loan each february 
this payment is a percentage  as calculated per the term loan agreement  of the prior years excess cash flow  as defined in the term loan agreement 
the required payment for is million 
we may elect to pay interest on the term loan at a rate of i libor plus  with a libor floor of or ii the term loan administrative agent s prime rate plus 
the term loan includes customary covenants  including total leverage ratio limits  fixed charge coverage minimums and restrictions on additional debt incurrence and dividend payments among others

in connection with the gemstar acquisition we issued million of senior notes due on august   the company fully redeemed the senior notes at par plus accrued interest and a million make whole payment representing the discounted value of interest which the note holders would have received through november   the first date the senior notes could be retired without a premium 
in august  we issued million in convertible notes which may be converted  under certain circumstances described below  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share

in september  the board of directors of macrovision corporation authorized a stock repurchase program  which allows us to purchase up to million of our common stock in the open market from time to time at prevailing market prices or otherwise  as conditions warrant 
on may   our board of directors reconfirmed this stock purchase program 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million shares of common stock for approximately million

our auction rate securities portfolio is solely comprised of aaa rated federally insured student loans and municipal and educational authority bonds 
however  the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
this limits the short term liquidity of these instruments and may limit our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities if we needed to convert some or all to cash in the near term 
included in the above are auction rate securities acquired through ubs ag with a par value of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and security investments 
changes in these factors may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows fixed income investments we have an investment portfolio of money market funds and fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  short term investments and long term marketable investment securities of million as of december  most of these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities while a decrease in interest rates could adversely affect the amount of interest income we receive 
our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade municipal bonds  money market mutual funds  us treasury and agency securities  corporate bonds  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
we regularly monitor the credit risk in our investment portfolio and take appropriate measures to manage such risks prudently in accordance with our investment policies 
as a result of adverse conditions in the financial markets  auction rate securities may present risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns 
at december   the fair value of our auction rate securities portfolio totaled approximately million 
our auction rate securities portfolio is comprised solely aaa rated federally insured student loans  municipal and educational authority bonds 
the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade for over one year due to insufficient bids from buyers 
this limits the short term liquidity of these securities 
included in the aforementioned securities are auction rate securities acquired through ubs ag with a par value of million

in 
table of contents december  the company entered into an agreement with ubs which provides the company the right to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs ag at par  at the company s sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and ubs ag the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on the company s behalf at par anytime through july  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk  however  by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
the primary objective of these policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our fixed income available for sale securities as of december  while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we believe that our investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rates 
due to our reliance on international and export sales  we are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
many of our subsidiaries operate in their local currency  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to the respective currency collected 
indebtedness 
the company has two debt instruments outstanding a million senior credit facility term loan current balance outstanding million and million in convertible notes
