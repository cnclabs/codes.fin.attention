our company we are a leading custom manufacturer of fine chemicals  specialty chemicals and propulsion products within our focused markets 
our fine chemicals products represent the active pharmaceutical ingredient api or registered intermediate in certain anti viral  oncology and central nervous system drugs 
our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment products are utilized in national defense programs and provide access to  and movement in  space  via solid propellant and propulsion thrusters 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the mission critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop customized solutions that meet rigorous federal and international regulatory standards 
we generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or limited source supplier 
we are the only north american producer of ammonium perchlorate  or ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in order to diversify our business and leverage our strong technical and manufacturing capabilities  we have made three strategic acquisitions in recent years 
each of these acquisitions provided long term customer relationships with sole source and limited source contracts and leadership positions in growing markets 
on october   we acquired the former atlantic research corporation s liquid in space propulsion business from aerojet general corporation  which became our aerospace equipment segment 
effective october   we further expanded our aerospace equipment segment with the acquisition of marotta holdings limited subsequently renamed ampac isp holdings limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively ampac isp holdings 
our us based aerospace equipment operation is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
ampac isp holdings designs  develops and manufactures high performance valves  pressure regulators  cold gas propulsion systems  and precision structures for space applications  especially in the european space market 
on november   we acquired gencorp inc s fine chemicals business  through our wholly owned subsidiary ampac fine chemicals llc  which is now our fine chemicals segment 
our fine chemicals segment is a leading custom manufacturer of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and registered intermediates for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our business segments our operations comprise four reportable business segments i fine chemicals  ii specialty chemicals  iii aerospace equipment and iv other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the years ended september fine chemicals specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues less than fine chemicals 
our fine chemicals segment  operated through our wholly owned subsidiaries ampac fine chemicals llc and ampac fine chemicals texas  llc collectively afc  is a custom manufacturer of apis and registered intermediates for commercial customers in the pharmaceutical industry 
the products we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with indications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
we generate nearly all of our fine chemicals segment sales from manufacturing chemical compounds that are proprietary to our customers 
we operate in compliance with the us food and drug administration s the fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp and the requirements of certain other regulatory agencies such as the european union s european medicines agency and japan s pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technological position  combined with our chemical process development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
in addition  our unique location in rancho cordova  california provides us with advantages for the production of chemicals for pharmaceutical controlled substances 
we believe that this will be an area of expansion for us 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  manufacturing chemical compounds that require high containment and performing energetic chemistries at commercial scale 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using commercial scale simulated moving bed  or smb  technology and own and operate two large scale smb machines  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we believe our distinctive competency in manufacturing chemical compounds that require specialized high containment facilities and handling expertise provide us a significant competitive advantage in competing for various opportunities associated with high potency  highly toxic and cytotoxic products 
many oncology drugs are made with apis that are high potency or cytotoxic 
afc is one of the few companies in the world that can manufacture such compounds at a multi ton annual rate 
moreover  our significant experience and specially engineered facilities make us one of the few companies in the world with the capability to use energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of products such as those used in anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  sole source and limited source contracts  which help provide us with earnings stability and visibility 
in addition  the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturing encourages stable  long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a custom manufacturer has been qualified as a supplier on a cgmp product  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing of the product to an alternative supplier  including the following alternative supply may not be readily available 
we are currently the sole source supplier on several of our fine chemicals products 
regulatory approval 
applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approvals and could take as long as two years to complete 
significant financial costs 
switching contractors and amending various filings can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical primarily used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems 
we have supplied ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and we have been the only ap supplier in north america since  when we acquired the ap business of our principal competitor  kerr mcgee chemical corporation 
a significant number of existing and planned space launch vehicles use solid propellant and thus depend  in part  upon our ap 
many of the rockets and missiles used in national defense programs are also powered by solid propellant 
alliant techsystems inc or atk is a significant ap customer 
we sell grade i ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for grade i ap and that requires atk to purchase its grade i ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual grade i ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
pricing varies inversely to volume and includes annual escalations 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our us based aerospace equipment operation is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
our products are utilized on various satellite and launch vehicle programs such as space systems loral s series geostationary satellites 
our european based aerospace equipment operation designs  develops and manufactures liquid propulsion thrusters  high performance valves  pressure regulators  cold gas propulsion systems  and precision structures for space applications  especially in the european space market 
these products are used on various satellites and spacecraft  as well as on the ariane launch vehicle 
other businesses 
our other businesses segment contains our water treatment equipment division and real estate activities 
our water treatment equipment business markets  designs  and manufactures electrochemical on site hypochlorite generation  or oshg systems 
these systems are used in the disinfection of drinking water  control of noxious odors  and the treatment of seawater to prevent the growth of marine organisms in cooling systems 
we supply our equipment to municipal  industrial and offshore customers 
our real estate activities are not material 
results of operations revenues year ended september  percentage change vs

fine chemicals specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues fine chemicals 
for fiscal  the decrease in fine chemicals segment revenues  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily reflects declines in core product revenues from anti viral products of  central nervous system cns products of  and oncology products of 
anti viral product revenues declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of an approximately reduction in volume for the anti viral product that was our largest core product in fiscal the volume decline for this product is due to the timing of completing the development of a new manufacturing process that is the basis for a new three year supply agreement with the customer 
deliveries of this product under the new agreement are expected to begin in early calendar year the new contract  which includes a take or pay provision  has a lower unit price for the product but at higher annual volumes 
the decrease in cns product revenues resulted from a customer advising us in may that they were deferring additional orders until calendar year we have received orders for this product for deliveries in the first quarter of calendar year and the customer has recently provided us with a non binding forecast for orders for calendar year that reflects improvement over fiscal levels 
this contract includes a take or pay provision that results in payments that help offset lower order volumes 
the decrease in oncology product revenues is primarily attributable to using certain manufacturing capacity for development products  described below 
certain of these development products are apis used to make drugs with oncology indications 
fiscal revenues from development products increased as compared to fiscal historically  including both fiscal and fiscal  revenues from development products were approximately of fine chemicals segment revenues 
in fiscal  development product revenues increased to of fine chemicals segment revenues and we anticipate that this percentage will trend upward in future years  supported by our recent investments in facilities and equipment 
development product revenues include revenues from research products  products which are not yet commercialized  and products which are commercial but for which we are not the current commercial producer 
typically  development product activities are the source for future core products 
the products categorized as development products are used by our customers primarily for drugs with indications in anti viral  cns  oncology and pain management 
revenues in this category also include the milling of cytotoxic materials  a capability we added in fiscal in february  the fda inspected the fine chemicals segment s rancho cordova facility and subsequently issued a form noting five observations 
in june  the fda issued a warning letter indicating management s written response to the form lacked specific corrective action 
since the warning letter was issued  we have taken additional corrective actions  including upgrades to certain facilities and equipment 
these actions resulted in the intentional idling of certain production lines while equipment upgrades were performed  as well as increased maintenance costs and capital expenditures 
our corrective actions continued into the first quarter of fiscal for fiscal  we anticipate that fine chemicals segment revenues will increase as compared to fiscal  representing significant increases in both core product and development product revenues 
more generally  the pharmaceutical markets are being driven by strong demand for products that use our core technologies  including hiv related drugs and oncology drugs  most of which are expected to use energetic and high potency compounds 
since a large percentage of new drugs is anticipated to be based on chirally pure material  we believe our investment in smb technology may be a strong competitive advantage for us in the future 
for fiscal  the decrease in fine chemicals segment revenues  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily reflected declines in core product revenues from anti viral products of  central nervous system products of  and oncology products of 
anti viral product revenues declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of an approximately reduction in volume for the anti viral product that was our largest core product in fiscal volume decline for this product was due to our customer s supply chain strategy and their desire to reduce their then current levels of inventory 
revenue declines for this product were partially offset by increases in revenues from one of our other core anti viral products 
the decrease in central nervous system product revenues resulted from a customer reducing its orders for the product until calendar year specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising   and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors a decrease in perchlorate volume offset by a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal a decrease in perchlorate volume and a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal sodium azide revenues decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues decreased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in total perchlorate volume for fiscal reflects an approximately decrease in ap volume for space related programs  offset by increases in volume for our other perchlorate products 
the ares program was the most significant space program for fiscal  while the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor rsrm program was the most significant space program in fiscal volumes for tactical and strategic missiles were consistent between fiscal and fiscal the increase in average price per pound of perchlorates in fiscal reflects two offsetting factors the average price per pound of grade i ap increased approximately proportionate and inverse to the decrease in grade i ap volume consistent with the contractual grade i ap price volume matrix and comparable catalog pricing 
this was offset  in part  by our other lower priced perchlorate products  such as sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate  which accounted for a greater percentage of all perchlorate product volume in the fiscal periods 
this change in the mix of perchlorate product sales had a reducing effect on the overall average price per pound of all perchlorate products 
the decrease in perchlorate volume for fiscal was primarily due to the completion of the minuteman iii propulsion replacement program in fiscal offset partially by increases in demand for space and tactical missile programs 
the average price per pound increased for fiscal primarily due to the effect of our contractual price volume matrix 
in addition  we sold more specialized blend product than in the comparable prior fiscal year periods 
we expect grade i ap demand in fiscal to be less than fiscal  primarily due to the upcoming retirement of the nasa space shuttle and uncertainties in the nasa budget for large solid rockets to be used on the new heavy lift vehicle 
we believe that such segment revenues will remain in fiscal within the expected stable range for this non growth segment 
over the longer term  we expect annual demand for grade i ap to be within the range of million to million pounds based on nasa and us department of defense dod production programs 
we believe that ap demand for dod programs will be stable over the next several years 
nasa demand for space related programs may vary depending on congressional and nasa decisions regarding the direction of the space program 
in february  the obama administration released its fiscal year budget which included the proposed cancellation of nasa s constellation space exploration program 
the ares rocket  produced by our customer atk  is a major part of the constellation program 
we are a major supplier of chemicals for this program  and it is a significant portion of the perchlorate demand 
congress recently passed the nasa authorization act which strongly recommends the use of large solid rockets  and therefore ap  for the new heavy lift vehicle 
congress will ultimately determine as part of the fiscal year authorization and appropriation legislative process the policy and funding levels for nasa and will decide on the future funding level for the heavy launch vehicle 
in addition  grade i ap revenues are typically derived from relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the changes in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and fiscal are due primarily to fluctuation in demand for sodium azide used in pharmaceutical applications 
we do not anticipate a significant increase in demand for sodium azide in fiscal changes in halotron revenues have been driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be relatively consistent year over year 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  isp 
as noted above  effective as of october   we acquired marotta holdings limited subsequently renamed ampac isp holdings limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
combined with our existing aerospace equipment segment operations in westcott  uk  these operations constitute ampac isp europe 
revenue growth of for the aerospace equipment segment during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was generated from both its us and european operations 
the primary growth component was revenue from sales of space propulsion engines  which increased in fiscal due largely to growth in the communication and commercial satellite markets 
the aerospace equipment segment concluded fiscal with a record high level of funded backlog of approximately  as of september  in july  our aerospace equipment segment finalized a two year contract with ohb system ag of bremen  germany  to produce fourteen propulsion modules for the full operational capability portion of the satellite supported european navigation system program 
the constellation of navigation satellites will provide gps type coverage for a wide variety of users throughout the world 
for fiscal  we anticipate that the aerospace equipment segment revenues should continue to grow as compared to fiscal  supported by this segment s record backlog level as of september  for fiscal  aerospace equipment segment revenues increased  due to both organic growth and the ampac isp holdings acquisition 
ampac isp holdings contributed  in revenues 
the remainder of the revenue increase was primarily attributed to this segment s us operations which experienced success with new contract awards  beginning in the latter part of fiscal this improvement in backlog resulted in significant revenue increases for propulsion systems in fiscal other businesses 
other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment and related spare parts sales and real estate revenues 
water treatment equipment sales increased in fiscal and  in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal years 
the revenue increases were driven by new system sales 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage in addition to the factors detailed below  one of the most significant factors that affects  and should continue to affect  the comparison of our consolidated gross margins from period to period is the change in revenue mix between our segments 
fiscal cost of revenues decreased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage was for both fiscal and fiscal the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons the fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage declined six points compared to the prior fiscal year 
reduced volume was the primary contributor to the reduction 
in addition  the segment experienced several manufacturing inefficiencies including increases in cycle times for certain core products  higher than anticipated costs associated with validating a process change for a core product  and higher than anticipated efforts associated with certain development products 
the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved six points because fiscal included a greater percentage of non grade i ap volume and fiscal benefited from unique cost items such as lower utilities and production variances which are not expected to recur 
the aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage declined seven points primarily due to increases in estimated costs to complete certain systems contracts 
these cost increases occurred primarily because engineering and design work required more efforts than anticipated  as well as because there were certain quality issues with supplier product 
for fiscal  we anticipate improvements in fine chemicals segment and aerospace equipment segment margins as they are expected to recover in the latter half of fiscal from the profit impacts of the fiscal operational and capacity issues  as well as the anticipated benefits from implementation of our cost reduction and operational excellence initiative 
however  low fine chemicals segment manufacturing volume during the second half of calendar is anticipated to continue to have a negative impact on expected margins for the first half of fiscal specialty chemicals segment margins are expected to remain strong in fiscal but decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal specialty chemicals segment margins 
we anticipate that this will be partially due to the anticipated reduction in specialty chemicals segment revenues in fiscal and partially because unique items that benefitted fiscal margins will not recur in fiscal fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage declined to compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the following factors affected our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for fiscal declined by approximately eight points  reflecting the following a decrease in the gross margin percentage due to lower production volume and the related impact on gross margin due to less absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the implementation of a new process for a large volume core anti viral product which experienced start up difficulties that negatively impacted margins for this product for the first half of fiscal a decrease in revenues for central nervous system products  including a price reduction for a large volume core product 
specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved two points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense from  for fiscal to zero for fiscal in mid fiscal second quarter  the specialty chemicals segment completed the amortization of the value assigned to the perchlorate customer list acquired in the fiscal year ended september  aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage improved two points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the improvement was primarily driven by the ampac isp europe operations which experienced gross margin increases due to greater volumes 
this improvement was offset somewhat by lower aggregate margins due to a change in product mix to a greater portion of propulsion systems in fiscal as compared to engines in fiscal operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
operating expenses percentage of revenues fiscal operating expenses increased  to  from  for fiscal primarily as a result of a  increase in fine chemicals segment operating expenses that is largely attributed to enhanced business development activities  as well as in additional costs associated with our recently acquired facility in texas 
an increase in aerospace equipment segment operating expenses of  that includes additional research and development expenses and additional management and organizational structure required to support the business growth 
research and development activities  which amounted to approximately  are focused in the area of product development  including aerospace valves and enhancements to our thruster engines 
a decrease in corporate operating expenses of the most significant components of this decrease include a reduction in corporate development expenses of  an increase in costs associated with our board of directors of  and other individually insignificant increases and decreases which aggregate to a decrease of fiscal operating expenses increased  to  from  for fiscal primarily as a result of a decrease in fine chemicals segment incentive compensation  as a result of recording no incentive compensation in fiscal an increase in specialty chemicals segment operating expenses primarily due to an increase of in employee benefit costs and an increase of in lab and research and development costs 
an increase in aerospace equipment segment operating expenses primarily due to additional operating expenses in the amount of  resulting from the acquisition of ampac isp holdings 
a decrease in corporate expenses  primarily including a decrease in incentive compensation of  as a result of recording no incentive compensation in fiscal  offset partially by increases in payroll and related costs of  rent of and stock based compensation of other decreases of environmental remediation charges 
during fiscal  we recorded an environmental remediation charge of  reflecting increases in our total cost estimate of probable costs for our henderson  nevada groundwater remediation operations

environmental remediation charges  corporate general and administrative costs and interest are not allocated to segment operating results 
fluctuations in segment operating income or loss are driven by changes in segment revenues  gross margins and operating expenses  each of which is discussed in greater detail above 
backlog agreements with our fine chemicals segment customers typically include multi year supply agreements 
these agreements may contain provisional order volumes  minimum order quantities  take or pay provisions  termination fees and other customary terms and conditions  which we do not include in our computation of backlog 
fine chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against a related supply agreement and stand alone purchase orders 
fine chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal our aerospace equipment segment is a government contractor  and accordingly  total backlog includes both funded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer 
we compute aerospace equipment segment total and funded backlog as the total contract value less revenues that have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
aerospace equipment segment total backlog and funded backlog were approximately  and  respectively  as of september   compared to total backlog and funded backlog of  and  respectively  as of september  we anticipate the majority of funded backlog as of september  to be completed during fiscal  with any remainder to be completed in the fiscal year ending september  backlog is not a meaningful measure for our other business lines 
while a substantial portion of our anticipated revenues for fiscal is currently in our backlog  the timing of our customer product requirements should result in at least a majority of our expected annual revenues for fiscal occurring in the second half of the fiscal year 
interest and other income expense year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
interest and other income expense  net interest income gain on sale of assets other total interest expense we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances and the applicable interest rate 
in fiscal  the gain on sale of assets relates to the final recognition of a deferred gain from a sale lease back transaction in october in fiscal  the lease was terminated and the associated deferred gain was recognized 
interest expense was consistent between fiscal  fiscal and fiscal because the interest rate for our primary credit facility is fixed 
income taxes 
our income tax expense benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance change in effective state income tax rate interest and penalties foreign tax rate differential other effective tax rate deferred tax assets are comprised of the following at september deferred tax assets environmental remediation reserves pension obligations tax credits and carryforwards intangible assets inventory accrued expenses other subtotal valuation allowance deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities property  plant and equipment prepaid expenses other deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax assets the following summarizes our tax credits and carryforwards as of september federal operating losses federal r d credits federal amt credits state operating losses uk operating losses ireland operating losses federal operating loss carryforwards  expiring in  federal r d credits and federal amt credits are available to reduce future federal taxable income 
we do not anticipate future taxable income in the states that have operating loss carryforwards and have provided a full valuation allowance of as of september  and because of a history of losses in foreign tax jurisdictions  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these operating loss carryforwards and  accordingly  have provided aggregate valuation allowances of  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we have not provided a us federal income tax for our foreign operations because we intend to permanently reinvest any foreign earnings

cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of changes in exchange rates on cash net change in cash for period operating activities fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year  resulting in an increase of significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations 
an increase in cash provided by working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes refunded of an increase in cash paid for interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of  other decreases in cash provided by operating activities of the increase in cash provided by working capital is comprised primarily of the following factors 
the fine chemicals segment accounted for approximately  of the increase as working capital needs were reduced as a result of the lower business volume in fiscal we anticipate that this trend will reverse as the fine chemicals segment business volume is expected to increase in fiscal the aerospace equipment segment accounted for approximately  of the increase  reflecting improvements in working capital management 
the other businesses segment accounted for approximately  of the increase as unusually high working capital balances as of september  returned to more normalized levels as of september  we consider these working capital changes to be routine and within the normal production cycle of our products 
the production of most fine chemical products requires a length of time that exceeds one quarter 
in addition  the timing of aerospace equipment segment revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method differs from the timing of the related billings to customers 
therefore  in any given quarter  accounts receivable  work in progress inventory or deferred revenues can increase or decrease significantly 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
in late fiscal  we commenced a project to engineer  design  and install additional equipment at our henderson  nevada remediation site 
the increase in environmental remediation spending in fiscal is due to this project 
see additional discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease of significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations 
an increase in cash used for working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
a decrease in cash taxes paid of  a decrease in cash interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of other increases in cash provided by operating activities of the increase in cash used for working capital accounts was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements to support the revenue growth of our aerospace equipment segment 
in addition  accounts receivable balances for our specialty chemicals segment were higher as of september  due to higher revenues in september these higher accounts receivable balances were substantially collected in october for fiscal  we did not pay federal income taxes based on the reduction in income and the effects of timing differences in expense deductions 
as a result  cash tax requirements were significantly reduced in fiscal compared to fiscal other increases in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected the timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal capital expenditures of  reflect an increase of  from capital expenditures of  in fiscal in april  our fine chemicals segment expanded its manufacturing capacity through the purchase of a fine chemicals facility in la porte  texas at a total cost of approximately  including direct purchase costs 
the purchase of this facility is accounted for as a capital expenditure 
we are anticipating our capital expenditures  which do not include environmental remediation spending  for fiscal to be approximately  our expected capital expenditures in fiscal include approximately  for fine chemicals segment equipment that is required to support a recently awarded  three year  core product contract and approximately  for facility upgrades in our fine chemicals segment to satisfy recent fda standards 
fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures decreased by  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to reductions in growth capital spending for our fine chemicals segment 
cash used for acquisition of business reflects the purchase of ampac isp holdings for  net of cash acquired of financing activities in june  we repurchased and cancelled  in principal amount of our senior notes for  which approximated the carrying value of the notes  net of deferred financing costs 
remaining financing cash flows for fiscal and fiscal primarily reflect capital lease payments and cash flows associated with stock option exercises 
fiscal also includes purchases of treasury stock 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flows from operations 
in addition  we have available funds under our committed revolving credit line  which matures in february our revolving line of credit had availability of  as of september  availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
we believe that changes in cash flow from operations during our fiscal periods reflect short term timing and as such do not represent significant changes in our sources and uses of cash 
because our revenues  and related customer invoices and collections  are characterized by relatively few individually significant transactions  our working capital balances can vary normally by as much as  from period to period 
we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  pension funding  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we are from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits related to our business operations and we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of litigation and other contingencies 
we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods  and  to the extent not covered by insurance  they may adversely affect our liquidity 
in contemplating the adequacy of our liquidity and available capital  we consider factors such as current results of operations  cash flows and backlog  anticipated changes in operating trends  including anticipated changes in revenues and margins  cash requirements related to our debt agreements and pension plans  and cash requirements related to our remediation activities  including amounts that we expect to spend through fall for the engineering  design  installation and cost of additional remediation equipment remediation capital 
see further discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
we do not currently anticipate that the factors noted above will have material effects on our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements 
we anticipate funding remediation capital with cash on hand 
we continue to believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
further  accounting charges for environmental remediation and cash spent for remediation capital do not impact our bank covenant compliance charges 
long term debt and revolving credit facilities senior notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  collectively  with the exchange notes issued in august as referenced below  the senior notes 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay our former credit facilities 
the senior notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in february and august 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our existing and future material us subsidiaries 
the senior notes are ranked equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ranked senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness  effectively junior to our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt  and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities including trade payables of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes 
the senior notes may be redeemed by us  in whole or in part  under the following circumstances at any time prior to february  at a price equal to of the purchase amount of the senior notes plus an applicable premium as defined in the related indenture  at any time on or after february  at redemption prices beginning at of the principal amount to be redeemed and reducing to by february   and under certain changes of control  we must offer to purchase the senior notes at of their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture which contains certain customary events of default  including cross default provisions if we default under our existing and future debt agreements having  individually or in the aggregate  a principal or similar amount outstanding of at least  and certain other covenants limiting  subject to exceptions  carve outs and qualifications  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create liens on assets to secure debt  incur dividend or other payment restrictions with regard to restricted subsidiaries  transfer or sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create an unrestricted subsidiary  enter into certain business activities  or effect a consolidation  merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the senior notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement which required us to file a registration statement to offer to exchange the senior notes for notes that have substantially identical terms as the senior notes and are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes as required by the registration rights agreement  which registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
in august  we completed the exchange of of the senior notes for substantially identical notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
revolving credit facility 
in february  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  as amended as of july  and september  the revolving credit facility  with wachovia bank  national association predecessor by merger to wells fargo bank  national association  and certain other lenders  which provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity of years 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility are  at our option  either the alternate base rate or libor rate each as defined in the revolving credit facility plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is tied to our total leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we pay commitment fees  other fees related to the issuance and maintenance of letters of credit  and certain agency fees 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains certain negative covenants restricting and limiting our ability to  among other things incur debt  incur contingent obligations and issue certain types of preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  make certain investments and acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets 
financial covenants under the revolving credit facility include quarterly requirements for total leverage ratio of less than or equal to to total leverage ratio  and interest coverage ratio of at least to through quarters ended june  and to for quarters thereafter interest coverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility defines total leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda and interest coverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
with respect to these covenant compliance calculations  consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit facility hereinafter  referred to as credit facility ebitda  differs from typical ebitda calculations and our calculation of adjusted ebitda  which is used in certain of our public releases and in connection with our incentive compensation plan 
the most significant difference in the credit facility ebitda calculation is the inclusion of cash payments for environmental remediation as part of the calculation 
the following statements summarize the elements of those definitions that are material to our computations 
consolidated funded debt generally includes principal amounts outstanding under our senior notes  revolving credit facility  capital leases and notional amounts for outstanding letters of credit 
credit facility ebitda is generally computed as consolidated net income loss plus income tax expense benefit  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation expense and less cash payments for environmental remediation and other non recurring gains in excess of in accordance with the definitions contained in the revolving credit facility  as of september   our total leverage ratio was to and our interest coverage ratio was to 
the revolving credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods  including cross default provisions that include our senior notes 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the revolving credit facility prior to its stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
as of september   under our revolving credit facility  we had no borrowings outstanding  availability of  and we were in compliance with its various financial covenants 
availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
pension benefits 
we maintain three defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of our us employees  excluding employees of our aerospace equipment segment the amended and restated american pacific corporation defined benefit pension plan  the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for salaried employees  and the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for bargaining unit employees  each as amended to date 
collectively  these three plans are referred to as the pension plans 
in may  our board of directors approved amendments to our pension plans which effectively closed the pension plans to participation by any new employees 
retirement benefits for existing us employees and retirees through june  are not affected by this change 
beginning july   new us employees will participate solely in one of the company s k plans 
pension plan benefits are paid based on an average of earnings  retirement age  and length of service  among other factors 
benefit obligations are measured annually as of september as of september   the pension plans had an unfunded benefit obligation of  for fiscal  we made contributions to the pension plans in the amount of  we anticipate making pension plan contributions in the amount of approximately  during fiscal we are required to make minimum contributions to our pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
in accordance with federal requirements  our minimum funding obligations are determined annually based on a measurement date of october the fair value of pension plan assets is a key factor in determining our minimum funding obligations 
holding all other variables constant  a decline in asset value as of september  would increase our minimum funding obligations for fiscal by approximately in addition  we maintain the american pacific corporation supplemental executive retirement plan  as amended and restated the serp that includes five participants comprised of active and former executive officers 
the serp is an unfunded plan and as of september   the serp obligation was  for fiscal  we paid serp retirement benefits of we anticipate contributing the amount of approximately to the serp during fiscal for the payment of retirement benefits 
payments for retirement benefits should increase in future years when each of the three current active participants retires 
the future increase in such retirement benefits will be determined based on certain variables including each participating individual s actual retirement date  rate of compensation and years of service 
during fiscal  our aggregate pension plans and serp liability increased significantly primarily due to changes in actuarial assumption such as the discount rate 
the change was recorded as an increase in pension obligations and a corresponding decrease in shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the effect of the change in the discount rate increased our anticipated fiscal funding requirements by approximately  environmental remediation ampac henderson site 
during our fiscal third quarter  we recorded a charge for  representing our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at our former perchlorate chemicals manufacturing facility in henderson  nevada the ampac henderson site  including the costs for capital equipment  operating and maintenance o m  and consultants 
the project consisted of two primary phases the initial construction of the remediation equipment phase and the o m phase 
during the fiscal year ended september   we increased our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase by  due primarily to changes in the engineering designs  delays in receiving permits and the resulting extension of construction time 
late in fiscal  we gained additional information from groundwater modeling that indicates groundwater emanating from the ampac henderson site in certain areas in deeper zones more than feet below ground surface is moving toward our existing remediation facility at a much slower pace than previously estimated 
utilization of our existing facilities alone  at this lower groundwater pace  could  according to this more recently created groundwater model  extend the life of our remediation project to well in excess of fifty years 
as a result of this additional data  related model interpretations and consultations with the nevada division of environmental protection  we re evaluated our remediation operations at the end of fiscal and during fiscal as new data was generated 
this evaluation indicates that we should be able to significantly reduce the total project time  and ultimately the total cost of the project  by installing additional groundwater extraction wells in the deeper  more concentrated areas  thereby providing for a more aggressive remediation treatment 
the additional wells and related remediation equipment will incorporate above ground treatment to supplement or possibly replace by consolidation our existing in situ bioremediation process 
with the additional extraction wells and equipment  we estimated that the total remaining project life for the existing and new  more aggressive deep zone systems could range from to years  beginning with fiscal within that range  we estimated that a range of to years is more likely 
groundwater speed  perchlorate concentrations  aquifer characteristics and forecasted groundwater extraction rates continue to be key variables underlying our estimate of the life of the project and these variables are updated on a regular basis 
if additional information becomes available in the future that lead to a different interpretation of the model  thereby dictating a change in equipment and operations  our estimate of the resulting project life could change significantly 
in our fiscal fourth quarter  we accrued approximately  representing our estimate of the cost to engineer  design  and install this additional equipment 
we anticipate that these amounts will be spent through and the new equipment operational by we are in the pre construction  design and engineering steps  and as a result  this estimate involves a number of significant assumptions 
due to uncertainties inherent in making estimates  our estimate may later require significant revision as new facts become available and circumstances change 
in addition to accruing approximately  for engineering  design  installation and cost of additional equipment  in our fiscal fourth quarter  we increased our estimate of total remaining o m costs by  due primarily to incremental o m costs to operate and maintain the additional equipment once installed 
total o m expenses are currently estimated at approximately  per year and estimated to increase to approximately  per year after the additional equipment becomes operational 
to estimate o m costs  we consider  among other factors  the project scope and historical expense rates to develop assumptions regarding labor  utilities  repairs  maintenance supplies and professional services costs 
if additional information becomes available in the future that is different than information currently available to us and thereby leads us to different conclusions  our estimate of o m expenses could change significantly 
in addition  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
as of september   the aggregate range of anticipated environmental remediation costs was from approximately  to approximately  based on a possible total remaining life of the project ranging from to years 
as of september   the accrued amount was  based on an estimate of remaining years  or the low end of the more likely range of the expected life of the project 
these estimates are based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
other arrangements operating leases 
we lease our corporate offices and production facilities for our aerospace equipment segment under operating leases with lease periods extending through certain of our operating leases contain step rent provisions and escalation clauses and also provide for cash allowances toward the funding of capital improvements 
our minimum lease payments include these considerations 
minimum lease payments are recognized as rental expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
estimated future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of september   are as follows years ending september thereafter total letters of credit 
as of september   we had  in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through july these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain water treatment equipment sold by us and payment of fees associated with the delivery of natural gas and power 
employee agreements 
we have an employment agreement with our chief executive officer 
the term of the employment agreement currently ends on september   unless amended or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salary  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
the employment agreement is primarily an at will employment agreement  under which we may terminate the executive officer s employment for any or no reason 
generally  the agreement provides that a termination without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
we maintain severance agreements with each of our vice president  administration and our chief financial officer  which  generally  provide that a termination of the executive without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under all of these agreements and arrangements was approximately  as of september  inflation 
generally  inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgment  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition 
revenues from our specialty chemicals segment  fine chemicals segment  and other businesses segment are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods 
specifically  these customers have contractually negotiated acceptance periods from the time they receive certificates of analysis and compliance certificates to reject the material based on issues with the quality of the product  as defined in the applicable agreement 
at times we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance 
if we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenue upon delivery of the product and recognize revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemicals products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities bill and hold transactions or arrangements 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the applicable revenue recognition criteria  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
for our bill and hold arrangements that contain customer acceptance periods  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues when such products are available for delivery and certificates have been delivered to the customers 
we recognize revenue on our bill and hold transactions in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
the sales value of inventory  subject to bill and hold arrangements  at our facilities was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
contract revenues include change orders and claims when approved by the customer 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
we do not incur material pre contract costs 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets 
our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the asset s estimated economic useful life or the lease term  if the asset is subject to a capital lease 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
to test for recovery  we group assets an asset group in a manner that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups are typically identified by facility because each facility has a unique cost overhead and general and administrative expense structure that is supported by cash flows from products produced at the facility 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
if we determine that an asset group is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
some of the factors that management would consider or estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we would use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
when we review asset groups for recoverability  we also consider depreciation estimates and methods or the amortization period  in each case as required by applicable accounting standards 
any revision to the remaining useful life of a long lived asset resulting from that review also is considered in developing estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset group for recoverability 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of september  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill  and  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount of goodwill in excess of its implied fair value 
environmental costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms and consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recoveries of the amounts are probable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  separately for each tax paying entity in each tax jurisdiction  using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
when measuring deferred tax assets  we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the assessment of valuation allowance requirements  if any  involves significant estimates regarding the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we rely on deferred tax liabilities in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets if the temporary timing difference is anticipated to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and the deferred tax liabilities are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
we weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is required 
as of september   recovery of our us jurisdiction deferred tax assets  net of applicable deferred tax liabilities  required that we generate approximately  in taxable income in periods ranging from one to at least years in the future 
to determine whether a valuation allowance is required  we project our future taxable income 
the projections require us to make assumptions regarding our product revenues  gross margins and operating expenses 
for our us tax jurisdictions  the most significant positive evidence is our historical long term trend of profitable operations and our forecast that such trend will continue in future periods when temporary differences are anticipated to reverse 
positive evidence also includes the lack of reliance on success in implementing tax planning strategies  utilization of short carry back periods or appreciated asset values 
further  we do not have a history of tax credits expiring unused 
for foreign tax jurisdictions  the most compelling negative evidence is a history of unprofitable operations 
accordingly  we have fully reserved our foreign deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with an accounting standard which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the standard also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this standard  we may recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits 
we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
applicable accounting standards require that we make assumptions and use statistical variables in actuarial models to calculate our pension obligations and the related periodic pension expense 
the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
additional assumptions include the future rate of compensation increases  which is based on historical plan data and assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of projected future pension payments to all participants 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on aaa aa rated corporate long term bonds 
at september of each year  the discount rate is determined using bond yield curve models matched with the timing of expected retirement plan payments 
our discount rate assumption was percent as of september  holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the plan funds invested in a specific target asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return assumption on pension plan assets was percent in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately recently issued or adopted accounting standards 
in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a new standard which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb deferred this standard for one year as it applied to certain items  including assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination  reporting units and certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value in connection with goodwill impairment tests  and long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments 
the standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
this standard was effective for us on october   however  we did not adopt all the provisions of the standard as the fasb delayed the effective date of its application to non financial assets and liabilities 
the remaining provisions became effective for us beginning october  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that significantly changed the accounting for business combinations 
under the standard  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the standard also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the standard applies to us for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after october  we expect that the new standard will have an impact on our accounting for future business combinations  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that establishes revised accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  the standard requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
it also clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
the standard requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
the standard also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the standard was effective for us beginning on october  we currently have no entities or arrangements that were affected by the adoption of this standard 
in april  the fasb issued a new standard which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the standard for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
however  the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized in the company s financial statements as of the effective date 
the standard was effective for us beginning on october  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
the objectives of the disclosures include disclosure of investment allocation decisions  major categories of plan assets  inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of certain fair value measurements  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the expanded disclosure requirements were effective for our fiscal year ended september  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone under topic and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones that should be evaluated individually 
we adopted this asu on october  we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will affect the timing of revenue recognition on certain existing and future research and development contracts for our fine chemicals segment 
however  because the term of these contracts are typically less than six months and the amount of revenues generated from such contracts are not material to our consolidated revenues  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
