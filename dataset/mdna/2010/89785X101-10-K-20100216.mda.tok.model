this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide the reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results 
our md a is presented in six sections overview results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments summary of critical accounting policies and estimates new accounting standards overview trueblue  inc trueblue  we  us  our is a provider of temporary blue collar staffing 
the temporary staffing industry includes a number of markets focusing on business needs that vary widely in duration of assignment and level of technical specialization 
we operate within the blue collar staffing market of the temporary staffing industry 
in  we connected approximately  people to work through the following blue collar staffing brands labor ready for general labor  spartan staffing for light industrial services  clp resources for skilled trades  planetechs for aviation and diesel mechanics and technicians  and centerline  formerly transportation logistics company  for dedicated and temporary drivers 
headquartered in tacoma  washington  we serve approximately  businesses primarily in the services  construction  transportation  manufacturing  retail  and wholesale industries 
we continue to face a challenging economic climate with customer spending being negatively impacted by the global recession as well as an increasingly competitive landscape 
we experienced a significant decrease in demand for blue collar staffing during the recession began in and continued throughout excluding the impact of acquisitions  we experienced revenue declines of in and in we began in to scale our cost structure to meet the declining demand for our services 
those efforts continued throughout and helped to ensure our continued profitability 
we believe the following actions have put us in a strong position to face the on going challenges of the current economic climate and increase profitability when the economic conditions improve 
during  we closed branches 
during  we closed branches and sold the remaining branches in the united kingdom for a total reduction of branches 
primary factors influencing which branches we closed included financial performance  ability to consolidate with another branch  tenure and quality of branch management  and long term potential of the location 
we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses in by million in comparison with this resulted from a reduction in branch locations  field management personnel  corporate support services and various program expenses 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc and bank of america  na for a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million 
the revolving credit facility  which expires june  replaces our previous million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na and bank of america  na  which was set to expire in april of borrowing availability is principally based on accounts receivable and the value of the company s corporate building whereas borrowing availability under the previous facility was based on ebitda 
we believe the new credit facility provides more borrowing availability during challenging economic conditions in comparison with the previous credit facility 
on july   we filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to sell various securities in amounts and prices determined at the time of sale 
the filing enables us to access capital efficiently and quickly if needed  however  we have no current plans to make an offering 
page 
table of contents on july   we negotiated the return of million of collateral from our primary workers compensation insurance carrier 
the collateral return came in the form of a million reduction in letters of credit issued to the carrier that was completed in september  and an million credit to be applied against future restricted cash deposits for the new policy year 
as of december   million of credits had been applied against restricted cash deposits 
the actions above enabled us to generate positive cash flows  maintain a strong balance sheet  improve our liquidity  and overall financial flexibility 
we also made significant investments in technology  which we believe will improve our branch operations 
the us economy remains weak and as a result we continue to experience pressure on the demand for blue collar staffing  which continues to negatively impact our performance 
we experienced some improvements towards the end of however  we believe the markets we serve will continue to experience pressure and that customers will continue to be sensitive to bill rate increases until the overall economy has returned to sustained growth 
we have no current plans to open any new branches and will continue to analyze branch performance and scale operations as needed in response to the recovering economy 
we will continue to focus on providing exceptional service to our customers while balancing the need for aggressive cost management and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
results of operations the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percent of revenue except effective income tax rate and per share amounts revenue from services cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense interest and other income interest and other income  net income before tax expenses income tax expense net income loss effective income tax rate net income loss per diluted share revenue from services revenue from services for each of the past three years is as follows in millions revenue from services revenue for decreased compared to this decline was largely related to lower usage of our services as customers reduced their workforces in response to the economic challenges of the revenue decline was also partially influenced by our decision to close certain branches 
during  we closed branches 
the primary factors in determining which branches to close have been financial performance  ability to consolidate with another branch  tenure and quality of branch management  and long term potential of the location 
revenue for decreased compared to the revenue decline for the year consisted of a decrease in organic revenue offset by growth from acquisitions completed within the last months ended fiscal like  the decline in page 
table of contents organic revenue for was related to our customers reducing their workforces in response to a slowing economy 
we experienced additional momentum in the rate of revenue decline as we entered the third quarter of due to additional uncertainty in the credit and capital markets 
in response to the drop in our organic revenue  we closed branches and sold the remaining branches in the united kingdom for a total reduction of branches 
the change in revenue for compared to and compared to is made up of the following components major revenue trends organic revenue growth decline acquisitions within last months total revenue growth decline organic revenue trends same branch new branches closed branches currency and other percentages for organic revenue components do not sum to total organic revenue growth as same branch growth is determined off a revenue base of branches open for or more months  whereas other organic revenue growth components are measured off a total revenue base 
same branch revenue is defined as those branches opened months or longer 
new branches are defined as those branches opened less than months 
revenue from our international operations for was approximately of our total revenue compared to and  respectively  for and the decline in resulted from a decline in organic revenue in canada and the sale of the remaining branches in the united kingdom in december our quarterly same branch revenue trends in comparison with the same period in prior years are as follows same branch growth decline first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter october november december the improvement in the rate of decline of our year over year quarterly same branch revenue trends for was due primarily to revenue stabilizing during the year and additional work associated with the boeing company and affiliates 
excluding the growth impact associated with the boeing company and affiliates  the same branch revenue decline for each quarter during would have been   and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit for each of the past three fiscal years is as follows in millions gross profit gross profit as a of revenue the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for as compared to is primarily due to pricing pressures  increased statutory minimum wages  and revenue mix 
the pricing pressure is due to increased competition 
our customers are requesting bill rate decreases and new customers are also requesting lower bill rates  in comparison with historical bill rates 
statutory minimum wages paid to our temporary workers has increased in states as well as in canada 
while we have increased the bill rates to our customers for pay increases  we have not fully passed through the amount of our standard markup due to our customers increased level of price sensitivity related to slower economic conditions 
page 
table of contents the impact on gross profit from revenue mix is related to several factors 
first  certain brands with a lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue have become a larger portion of our business during the recession 
second  our mix of blue collar staffing business has adapted to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace by pursuing business with larger customers that typically carries lower gross margins 
in our opinion  larger customers have fared better during the recession in comparison with smaller customers and have presented more overall revenue opportunities 
third  our construction related revenue mix  which has generally been more profitable  has become a smaller percentage of our total revenue in comparison with the prior year 
pricing pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the improvement in workers compensation 
workers compensation costs for were approximately of revenue compared to of revenue for the improvement in workers compensation expense is due to the acquisition of businesses that have lower workers compensation costs than our core business and the continued success of our accident prevention and risk management programs that have been implemented over several years 
we continued to experience positive trends in our accident rates and management of prior year claims 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for as compared to is primarily due to increases in wages paid to temporary workers 
there were state minimum wage increases during as well as minimum wage increases in our international operations 
while we increased the bill rates to our customers for these pay increases  we did not fully pass through our standard markup due to an increased level of price sensitivity with our customers associated with slower economic conditions 
also  our construction related revenue mix  which has generally been more profitable  has become a smaller percentage of our total revenue in comparison with the prior year  which reduced our overall gross margin 
workers compensation costs as a percentage of revenue for were approximately compared to for  which helped offset the negative impact from minimum wage increases and the drop in construction related revenue 
the improvement in workers compensation expense was due primarily to the continued success of our accident prevention and risk management programs that have been implemented over several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses in by million in comparison with commencing in  we have taken aggressive cost management actions across the organization 
we closed branches in and branches in further  we have consolidated branch management  field management  substantially all back office support activities  and reduced various program expenses 
sg a expense dollars declined by compared to but increased as a percent of revenue  due to the fixed cost nature of certain sg a costs 
our cost management actions position us well to harness the strong operating leverage of our business model as the economy recovers 
the decrease in sg a expense as a percent of revenue during compared to was largely attributed to the impact of acquisitions and cost control measures offset by a decline in organic revenue 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue for acquired companies was lower than that of our existing business  creating a decrease in the overall blended sg a expense as a percentage of revenue 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may exist such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
our assessment indicated that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying values and  therefore goodwill was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
as a result of this decline  our market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets 
the reduced market capitalization reflected  in part  the economic climate at the time  as well as expected continued weakness in pricing and demand for our temporary staffing services 
as a result of our assessment  we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for the clp which includes ssc  spartan staffing which includes pmi and centerline reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and we recorded non cash impairment losses of million  which was page 
table of contents reflected on our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december  our assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment indicated that as of december   the fair value of each of the labor ready and planetechs reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
depreciation  interest and income taxes depreciation  interest and other income  and income tax expenses for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions depreciation and amortization interest and other income  net effective income tax rate depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation increased for fiscal as compared to by million resulting primarily from investments in technology to improve branch and branch support efficiencies 
the increase was largely offset by million of decreased amortization of intangible assets as a result of their impairment in fiscal the increased depreciation and amortization for as compared to is primarily due to amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions over the past years 
amortization of acquired intangibles is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
interest and other income  net 
net interest income has declined over the past three years due to a continued decline in investment yields on our restricted and unrestricted cash 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in  as compared to in and in excluding the non deductibility of our million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in  our effective income tax rate in would have been 
the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state and foreign income taxes  federal tax credits  and certain non deductible expenses 
the increase in the effective income tax rate in compared to  excluding the non deductible impairment charge  was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters during the decrease in the effective income tax rate in compared to  excluding the non deductible impairment charge  was primarily due to the same favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters during results of operations future outlook we have faced significant economic challenges during the past two years  which have negatively impacted our operating results 
we have made many adjustments to adapt to these challenges and believe that we enter at a new baseline for the ongoing execution of our operating strategies 
since the economy does remain weak  our intent is to proceed cautiously as the economic recovery unfolds 
the following highlights represent our expectations in regard to operating trends for the coming year 
these expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy we do not expect significant fluctuations to our top line revenue compared to however we do believe that the significant revenue declines of the recession are abating and that the staffing industry has the potential to return to growth in we expect our gross profit as a percentage of revenue to be pressured by cost control efforts of our customers and increases in state unemployment taxes 
sg a expenses are not expected to fluctuate significantly from the level 
a large portion of our sg a expense represents fixed costs  which is now properly sized to match our company s needs coming out of the recent economic challenges 
however  we remain committed to seeking additional efficiencies in how we run our business and believe our business is well positioned to produce strong incremental profit associated with an increase in same branch revenue due to the operating leverage in our business 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
over the past three fiscal years  cash from operations provided approximately million 
page 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions net income loss goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts stock based compensation deferred income taxes other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities  exclusive of businesses acquired accounts receivable income taxes workers compensation accounts payable and accrued expenses other net cash provided by operating activities net income for was million as compared to a net loss for of million 
results for include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million related to the company s acquisitions over the past five years 
excluding this impairment charge  net income would have been million 
the charge is largely a result of the adverse impact on expected future cash flows related to the global recession 
the charge did not impact the company s cash  liquidity  or compliance with banking covenants 
the decline in net income in and is due to the recession 
depreciation increased for as compared to by million resulting primarily from investments in technology to improve branch and branch support efficiencies 
the increase was largely offset by million of decreased amortization of intangible assets as a result of their impairment in fiscal the increased depreciation and amortization for as compared to is primarily due to amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions over the past five years 
amortization of acquired intangibles is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
changes in accounts receivable when combined with the provision for doubtful accounts for compared to remained relatively unchanged 
accounts receivable decreased in as compared to primarily due to the economic recession and the resulting declines in sales and accounts receivable 
changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses during are primarily due to cost control measures and our response to the economic recession 
generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as we increase temporary labor services provided 
such was the case for fiscal and as compared to their respective prior years 
during  the estimated claims decreased as we decreased temporary services provided due to the recession 
the change in income taxes during is primarily due to tax refunds claimed in and received in the change in income tax receivable during is primarily due to current tax deductions for internally developed software and a corresponding claim for a refund of estimated tax payments  as well as overpayment of taxes in cash flows from investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions capital expenditures purchases of marketable securities maturities of marketable securities acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired change in restricted cash other net cash used in investing activities page 
table of contents capital expenditures in  and were primarily due to significant investments made to upgrade our proprietary information systems 
these upgrades are substantially complete and we anticipate that total capital expenditures will decline to approximately million in we held no marketable securities as of year end december  and made no investments in marketable securities for the fifty two weeks ended december  we had net maturities of marketable securities in and net maturities of marketable securities were higher in than as funds that would have been used to purchase additional marketable securities were used to fund share purchases and the acquisitions of ssc  planetechs  tlc  and pmi 
acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  included the purchase of several entities 
in march  we purchased substantially all of the assets of tlc  a skilled truck driver staffing provider  for million 
in april  we purchased pmi  an industrial staffing provider  for million 
in april  we purchased ssc  a skilled construction trades staffing provider  for million 
in december  we purchased substantially all of the assets of planetechs  a leading provider of aircraft maintenance staffing  for million 
we are required by our insurance carriers to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation with cash and cash backed instruments  letters of credit  or surety bonds 
total collateral decreased for however  the mix of restricted cash and letters of credit changed resulting in an increase to restricted cash and a decrease to letters of credit 
the change in restricted cash during and is primarily due to a decrease in the collateral requirements for our workers compensation program over the prior year 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows used in financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions purchases and retirement of common stock net proceeds from sale of stock through options and employee benefit plans shares withheld for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock payments on debt other net cash used in financing activities we purchased and retired million and million shares of our common stock in and  respectively 
future outlook we have been successful in maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving access to capital 
while we acknowledge that the past and potential future challenges of the economic downturn are not yet behind us  we believe we are well positioned to mitigate potential future pressure on operating cash flows 
listed below are our current means to mitigate negative operating cash flow in the event it occurs we have a cash and cash equivalents balance of million as of december  on june   we replaced our credit facility with a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million 
our borrowing availability is principally based on accounts receivable and the value of the company s corporate building whereas borrowing availability under the previous facility was based on ebitda 
we believe the new credit facility provides more borrowing availability during challenging economic conditions in comparison with the previous credit facility 
we have million of borrowing available under our existing credit facility as of december  the majority of our workers compensation payments are made from restricted cash versus cash from operations 
at december   approximately two thirds of our workers compensation reserve is covered by restricted cash 
on july   we filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which allows us to sell various securities in amounts and prices determined at the time of sale 
the filing enables us to access capital efficiently and quickly if needed pending current market conditions 
until we see sustained improvement in year over year trends  we will continue to aggressively control costs  limit new branch openings and tightly control capital expenditures 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  should economic conditions further deteriorate  our financial results would be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
page 
table of contents capital resources on june   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc and bank of america  na  for a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility  which expires in june  replaced our previous million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na and bank of america  na  which was set to expire in april of the old revolving facility 
as of december   the maximum million was available under the revolving credit facility and million of letters of credit have been issued against the facility  leaving an unused portion of million 
the maximum amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility of million  is subject to certain borrowing limits 
we are limited to of the amount of our eligible accounts receivable 
eligible accounts receivable include all accounts receivable less items such as invoices aged over ninety days  cross aged receivables  and other items  plus of the liquidation value of our tacoma headquarters office building not to exceed million  less a reserve in an amount equal to the payroll and payroll taxes for our temporary employees for one payroll cycle  and less other reserves if deemed applicable 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we pay interest and fees on loans set  at our option  at either libor or prime rate  each subject to a minimum  plus a margin of  outstanding letters of credit priced at the margin in effect for libor loans plus a fronting fee of  and the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an annual rate of 
the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain liquidity in excess of million 
we are required to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio in the event that liquidity falls below million 
the liquidity level is defined as the amount we are entitled to borrow as advances under the revolving credit facility plus the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts subject to a control agreement benefiting the lenders 
the amount we were entitled to borrow at december  was million and the amount of cash and cash equivalents under control agreements was million for a total of million  which was well in excess of our million liquidity requirement 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility limits the amount of our common stock we can purchase to million during any twelve month period and the aggregate of cash dividends we pay can not exceed million at any time  unless we obtain consent from our lenders to increase these amounts 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property and our headquarters located in tacoma  washington 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments to our insurance carriers to satisfy workers compensation collateral needs 
these instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash backed bonds  cash held in trusts  as well as cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
at december   we had restricted cash held primarily by our insurance carriers totaling million 
the majority of our collateral is held by chartis  formerly known as aiu holdings  inc  a subsidiary of american international group  inc 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  is cash held within branch cash dispensing machines cdms for payment of temporary payrolls in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  should economic conditions further deteriorate  our financial results would be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
workers compensation collateral and claims reserves we provide workers compensation insurance for our temporary and permanent employees 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses  which are discounted to their estimated net present value 
the discounted workers compensation claims reserve was million at december  page

reserves are estimated for both claims incurred in the current year  as well as claims incurred during prior years 
management evaluates the adequacy of the workers compensation reserves in conjunction with an independent quarterly actuarial assessment 
factors we consider in establishing and adjusting these reserves include the estimates provided by our independent actuary and appropriate discount rates 
factors considered by our independent actuary include  among other things changes in medical and time loss indemnity costs  mix changes between medical only and indemnity claims  regulatory and legislative developments that have increased benefits and settlement requirements  mix changes among brands or types of work within a brand  the impact of safety initiatives implemented  and positive or adverse development of claim reserves 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
however  we have full liability for all remaining payments on claims that originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december prior to  we were insured by various carriers who are insolvent and for which we are substantially reserved against any claims above the self insurance limit

when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized from insurance companies that are insolvent 
increases to the estimated valuation allowance resulted in increases in our reserves of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and respectively 
these increases are recorded in the income statement in the period in which the changes are made 
liabilities assumed from acquired businesses  net of discount 
we assumed the workers compensation reserve related to our acquisitions of skilled services corporation and planetechs  llc in and personnel management  inc in workers compensation insurance policies while we have primary responsibility for all claims  our insurance coverage provides reimbursement for certain losses and expenses beyond our deductible limits 
our workers compensation insurance policies are renewed annually 
we had coverage with chartis for occurrences during the period from july to july and renewed our coverage with chartis effective july to july we are also self insured with certain state workers compensation programs  which are typically renewed on an annual basis 
workers compensation collateral our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation  for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
the collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash backed instruments  letters of credit  and or surety bonds 
on a regular basis these entities assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
we generally anticipate that our collateral obligations will continue to grow 
we pay our premiums and deposit our collateral in installments 
should our financial results deteriorate  these entities may require additional collateral  or we may see a shortening of the amount of time that we are allowed to pay our premiums and deposit collateral 
in addition  our surety bonds issuers could require more cash to back the outstanding surety bonds 
chartis holds the majority of the restricted cash collateralizing our self insured workers compensation policies 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our collateral commitments to our workers compensation reserve as of the period end dates presented in millions december  december  ending workers compensation reserve add back discount on reserves less portion of workers compensation not requiring collateral less discounted reserves for claims above our deductible total collateral commitments our claims reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value while our collateral commitments are based on the gross  undiscounted reserve 
collateral posted with the current insurance carrier and various state entities in comparison to the estimated balance of unpaid claims 
our workers compensation reserves include not only estimated expenses for claims within our self insured limit but also estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits 
at december  and december  our total collateral commitments were made up of the following components in millions december  december  cash collateral held by insurance carriers letters of credit surety bonds total collateral commitments we had million of restricted cash collateralizing our letters of credit at both december  and december  we had million of restricted cash collateralizing our surety bonds at both december  and december  we typically earn interest income on the cash collateral held by insurance carriers 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions to issue letters of credit on our behalf under the revolving credit facility 
our surety bonds are issued by independent page

the terms of these bonds are subject to review and renewal every one to four years and most bonds can be canceled by the sureties with as little as days notice 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of the end of fiscal payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total through through and later capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other obligations total contractual cash obligations primarily payments on communication equipment

summary of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation reserves we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates are impacted by claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our self insured limits excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have page 
table of contents with insurance companies 
we discount the liability and its corresponding receivable to their respective estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
there are two main factors that impact workers compensation expense the number of claims and the cost per claim 
the number of claims is driven by the volume of hours worked  the business mix which reflects the type of work performed  and the safety of the environment where the work is performed 
the cost per claim is driven primarily by the severity of the injury  the state in which the injury occurs  related medical costs and lost time wage costs 
a change in the number of claims or cost per claim would impact workers compensation expense by approximately million 
we have not had significant changes in our assumptions used in calculating our reserve balance 
however  our reserve balances have been positively impacted primarily by the success of our accident prevention programs 
in the event that we are not able to further reduce our accident rates  the positive impacts to our reserve balance will diminish 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements 
changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however  based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
our annual impairment test is performed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of our tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining our reporting units  the fair value of a reporting unit  the fair value of assets and liabilities within a reporting unit  and when to test for impairment requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  judgments and assumptions are required to allocate assets and liabilities to reporting units 
we test our intangible assets with a finite life for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values  which are based on projected undiscounted future net cash flows 
estimating fair values involves significant assumptions  especially regarding future sales prices  sales volumes  and costs 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal  state  and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws  taxes  workers compensation  immigration  and safety 
from time to time we are also subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory page 
table of contents liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that an insurance company is contractually obligated to reimburse us for a liability  we record a receivable for the amount of the probable reimbursement 
we evaluate our reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as changes to federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
as of december   our purchased investments included in cash and cash equivalents had maturities of less than days 
therefore  an increase or decrease in interest rates immediately and uniformly by from our year end levels would not have a material effect upon our cash and cash equivalent balances  operating results or cash flows 
we have a certain amount of assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to our international operations 
we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk and we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results or cash flows
