item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
item a 
risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward looking information 
however  our actual results may differ materially from our expectations  statements or projections 
the following risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from our expectations  statements or projections 
general factors the ongoing crisis in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing global financial crisis may limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions 
accordingly  if the global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments 
we have a history of operating losses  and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years 
in and  we had operating losses of million and million  respectively 
cash used in operations in and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  we continue to pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities and may need to support the financing needs of our subsidiaries 
following our recent capital raise see recent developments  we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may need additional funds to finance future investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake 
we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may have to limit or adjust our investment acquisition strategy or sell some of our assets in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals 
we depend on key management for the success of our business 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of john a 
moore  our ceo  william j 
mcmahon  ceo of coalogix scr tech  benny sela  ceo of dsit  ray simonson  ceo of coreworx and other key management level employees 
the loss of the services of any of these key employees could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees other than for our ceo  john a 
moore 
although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them  members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods 
we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations 
we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel 
the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers 
the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules 
the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers 
most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non competition agreements 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  our business could be disrupted 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common shares or the common stock of our subsidiaries 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
on march   coreworx and acorn energy entered into a definitive agreement for coreworx to acquire decision dynamics technology ltd 
see recent developments  and we plan to close on our acquisition of gridsense in the second quarter of any failure to effectively integrate decision dynamics or gridsense s management into our controls  systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our strategy is to continue to expand in the future  including through acquisitions 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business  including failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies  dilution of existing stockholders  potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies  sales and marketing  and research and development efforts  and the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including accounting controls and procedures 
if any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the same could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
moreover  any significant acquisition could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements 
both the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities 
we expect these rules and regulations to further increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make compliance and other activities more time consuming and costly 
we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
we are currently involved in litigation and may in the future may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us we are currently parties to two litigation matters which are described under item legal proceedings 
also  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting principles  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more frequently  if certain conditions exist 
any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
the financial soundness of our customers could affect our business and operating results 
as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers may experience cash flow concerns 
as a result  if customers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for services may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful  others may duplicate our technology 
our operating companies rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  systems designs and manufacturing processes 
the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will issue or  in the case of patents issued  that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes 
further  a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas 
even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad  they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours 
we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products  systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends 
we rely  to a significant degree  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these trade secrets cannot be protected by patent protection 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful 
we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology related industries and we believe that the industries that certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity 
third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop  manufacture or provide our current and future products  systems or services infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights 
we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products  systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others 
the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology  products  systems and services 
in addition  the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty 
litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights 
we are currently pursuing one such claim as described under item legal proceedings and may find it necessary to commence such litigation in the future to protect our rights and future business opportunities 
we can offer no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a majority of our cash equivalent deposits is a money market of a major financial institution which invests only in us treasury bills 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from four customers that pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
risks related to coalogix scr tech has incurred significant net losses since inception and may never achieve sustained profitability 
scr tech has incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that scr tech will improve its operating results in  however  we can provide no assurance that scr tech will generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
the size of the market for scr tech s business is uncertain 
scr tech offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services 
the size and growth rate for this market will ultimately be determined by a number of factors  including environmental regulations  the growth in the use of scr systems to reduce nox and other pollutants  the length of operation of scr systems  the adoption of regeneration versus replacement  the expansion of warranty coverage from scr catalyst oems  the cost of new scr catalyst  and other factors  most of which are beyond the control of scr tech 
there is limited historical evidence in the united states as to the cycle of replacement  cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst so as to accurately estimate the potential growth of the business 
in addition  the number of times a catalyst can be regenerated is unknown  which also may affect the demand for regeneration in lieu of purchasing new catalyst 
any delay in the development of the market could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
scr tech may be subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
we are aware of one company  evonik energy services  llc  formerly known as steag evonik llc  which entered the us catalyst regeneration market in evonik llc has currently built a regeneration facility in north carolina 
evonik llc  based in kings mountain  north carolina  is a subsidiary of a german power producer  evonik steag gmbh evonik gmbh 
evonik gmbh is very large and has substantially greater resources than scr tech or us 
competition from evonik may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
we are also aware of at least one other company  enerfab  inc that provides scr catalyst management  rejuvenation and cleaning services 
we are aware of certain companies  including cormetech and babcock hitachi  who have indicated an interest in offering catalyst cleaning and regeneration  and it is possible that manufacturers of new catalyst and other companies may enter the business of scr catalyst regeneration 
there also are a number of scr catalyst manufacturers with substantial parent companies that may seek to maintain market share by significantly reducing prices of new scr catalyst which will put pressure on our operating margins 
these companies include cormetech inc owned by mitsubishi heavy industries and corning  inc  argillon group owned by johnson matthey  ceram  haldor topsoe  inc and babcock hitachi 
further  if the scr catalyst regeneration market expands as we expect  additional competitors could emerge 
in addition  if our intellectual property protection is weakened  competition could more easily develop 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services llc  et al 
may not be successful  and the counterclaims of evonik energy services llc against scr tech may be successful 
we will incur significant expenses in pursuing our lawsuit against evonik and in defending against evonik s counterclaims 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services  llc and other defendants as described in item  legal proceedings  is associated with certain significant risks 
the lawsuit will require the time and attention of senior management of scr tech  and could divert attention from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit may cause a diversion of significant funds needed by scr tech to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
we anticipate that the evonik llc defendants will vigorously defend themselves  and that evonik llc will vigorously pursue its counterclaims against scr tech 
in the event scr tech is unsuccessful in the lawsuit and evonik llc prevails in its counterclaims  evonik llc may be awarded substantial damages against scr tech 
scr tech has not reserved funds for any loss contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
in addition  if scr tech is unsuccessful  evonik llc will remain a competitor of scr tech 
coalogix may not prevail in the lawsuit filed against it by environmental energy systems  inc the lawsuit brought by environmental energy services  inc ees against coalogix is associated with certain significant risks 
the lawsuit will require the time and attention of senior management of coalogix  and could divert attention from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit have and may continue to cause a diversion of significant funds needed by coalogix to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
in the event coalogix is unsuccessful in defending the lawsuit and ees prevails in its claims  ees may be awarded substantial damages against coalogix including costs  interest and attorneys fees 
coalogix has not reserved funds for any loss contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
scr tech s business is subject to customer concentration 
scr tech offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services to coal fired power plants 
some of the utilities operating these plants are exceptionally large and operate a number of such power plants 
thus  one or more large utilities could provide a very large order or orders to scr tech which likely would result in one or two such utilities providing most of the orders and revenues for scr tech for a particular quarterly or annual period 
during  two customers represented about of coalogix revenue 
during  three customers represented about of coalogix revenue 
although large orders are beneficial to scr tech by providing a large and consistent source of orders and revenues without the additional cost associated with marketing to a larger number of smaller customers  scr tech is dependent on a relatively small number of large utilities for its business 
the loss of one of these customers would have a much greater adverse effect on scr tech than the loss of a smaller customer 
this may also result in significant swings in orders and revenues on a quarterly basis as well as impacting on our cash flows 
scr tech s business may be impacted by changes in government regulation and environmental legislation 
our business is significantly dependent on the nature and level of government regulation of emissions 
for instance  the environmental protection agency s epa clean air interstate rule cair was vacated by the district of columbia court of appeals in july  and was subsequently re instated in december by the same court just days before the vacature became effective 
we expect the epa to revise cair or replace it with other clean air regulations  but we cannot at this time to predict the nature of such revisions or replacement regulations 
without government regulation of coal fired power generation  scr catalyst would not be used by utilities  there would be no need for utilities to acquire  clean or regenerate scr catalyst  and scr tech would have no business purpose 
further  changes in or adverse interpretations of governmental accounting or rate based emissions regulations also could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although government regulation of emissions has become increasingly stringent in recent years  the growing costs associated with such regulations and the economic downturn in the us may limit the level of increase and scope of emissions requirements  which could limit the potential growth of our target markets 
any easing  delay or deferral of governmental emissions requirements or the growth rate of such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the coal industry is subject to regular enactment of new or amended federal  state and local environmental and health and safety statutes  regulations and ballot initiatives  as well as judicial decisions interpreting these requirements 
these requirements may impose substantial capital and operating costs and operational limitations on us and may adversely affect our business 
the requirements may also affect our customers decisions to utilize our services which may materially adversely affect our business 
scr tech s business is subject to potential seasonality 
prior to the january  effective date of phase i of cair  some utilities and ipps operated their scr units only during the ozone season may september 
because of this  scr tech s business was more limited than if scr units were required to operate on a continual basis 
during non ozone season periods  most operators had limited if any requirements to run their scr systems 
given that phase i of cair effectively requires operators run their scr systems on a continual basis beginning january   we expect less concentration of scr tech s business during the ozone season each year 
however  utilities and ipps may continue to schedule outages and down time for maintenance during periods beyond our control  resulting in seasonality of scr tech s business 
these potential fluctuations in revenues and cash flow during a year may be significant and could materially impact our quarterly earnings and cash flow 
this may have a material adverse effect on the perception of our business and the market price for acorn s common stock 
scr tech does not own its regeneration facilities and it is subject to risks inherent in leasing the site of its operations 
scr tech does not own its regeneration site  instead it leases it from clariant corporation  the us subsidiary of a switzerland based public company clariant 
although we believe the lease terms are favorable  the dependence on clariant and the site could subject scr tech to increased risk in the event clariant experiences financial setbacks or loses its right to operate the site 
this risk is heightened because the site is a federal superfund site under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  which increases the risks that the site ultimately could be shut down or that clariant will be financially unable to continue its ownership of the site 
it may be difficult to relocate to another site on a timely or cost effective basis  and scr tech s business could be negatively impacted by any problems with continuing to conduct its operations at its current site 
furthermore  scr tech does not own its second regeneration site which is under construction  instead it leases it from fat boy trading company fat boy  an independent owner of the site 
the dependence of scr tech on fat boy at the second site could subject scr tech to increased risk in the event fat boy experiences financial setbacks or is unable to operate the site under the terms of the lease 
scr tech could be subject to environmental risks as a result of the operation of its business and the location of its facilities 
the operation of scr tech s business and the nature of its assets create various environmental risks 
scr tech leases its site for operations at a property listed on the national priority list as a federal superfund site the clariant site 
five cercla areas those areas of concern identified under the cercla program are identified on the property  and while scr tech does not lease any property identified as a cercla area  one such cercla area has resulted in contamination of groundwater flowing underneath one of the buildings leased by scr tech 
although scr tech has indemnification from clariant for any environmental liability arising prior to the operation of scr tech s business at the site  we can provide no assurance that such indemnification will be sufficient or that scr tech would be protected from an environmental claim from the nature of the site 
in addition  the operation of scr tech s business involves removal of hazardous wastes from catalyst and the use of significant chemical materials 
as a result  scr tech could be subject to potential liability resulting from such operations 
to date  neither acorn nor scr tech has been identified as a potential responsible party to such environmental risks  nor have any amounts been recorded to accrue for these potential exposures 
we will be required to make significant capital expenditures to expand scr tech s production facilities or for other purposes  we may require additional capital for such purposes 
in order to meet anticipated demand for increased orders for scr regeneration services in and beyond  we expect to incur substantial capital expenditure costs over the next year to construct a second scr regeneration plant at the fat boy site 
because of necessary permitting  site search  time for construction and equipment purchases  we can provide no assurance that scr tech could meet the demands from a rapid increase in orders in a timely manner 
any failure to timely fulfill such orders could have an adverse impact on scr tech s business 
if we incur the expected capital expenditures to expand the capacity of scr tech  but the market does not develop as we expect or increased competition results in loss of significant business  we may not generate enough additional revenue from such expenses 
this could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
moreover  other unanticipated expenses for scr tech  such as litigation or other costs for protecting intellectual property rights or as a result of a significant corporate transaction could result in the need for additional capital 
these additional funding requirements may be significant  and funds may not be available when required or may be available only on terms unsatisfactory to us 
our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the market acceptance of our product and service offerings  the ability of scr tech to generate significant cash flow  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our production capacity  our ability to manage selling  general and administrative expenditures and the timing and extent of scr tech related research and development projects 
in addition  we continue to actively pursue possible business opportunities  including but not limited to  mergers  acquisitions or other strategic arrangements 
such strategic opportunities could require the use of additional cash  or could require additional equity or debt financing 
the nature and amount of any such financing or the use of any capital in any such transaction cannot be predicted and will depend on the terms and conditions of the particular transaction 
certain of scr tech s capital equipment are unique to our business and would be difficult and expensive to repair or replace 
certain of the capital equipment used in the services performed by scr tech has been developed and made specifically for us and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
in addition  certain of our equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors 
consequently  any damage to or breakdown of our equipment at a time when we are regenerating large amounts of scr catalyst at scr tech may have a material adverse impact on our business 
scr tech is dependent on third parties to perform certain testing required to confirm successful regeneration 
in connection with the regeneration of scr catalyst  scr tech generally must have an independent company provide testing services to determine the level of success of regeneration 
currently there are a limited number of companies providing this service 
if scr tech is unable to obtain this service on a cost effective basis  scr tech may not be able to perform its regeneration services 
in addition  if the testing cannot be completed in a timely manner  there may be a slowdown of operations which can negatively impact the profitability and financial condition of the company 
significant price increases in key materials may reduce scr tech s gross margins and profitability of regeneration of scr catalyst 
the prices of various chemicals used to regenerate scr catalyst can be volatile 
if the long term costs of these materials were to increase significantly  we would attempt to reduce material usage or find substitute materials 
if these efforts were not successful or if these cost increases could not be reflected in our price to customers  then our gross margins and profitability of regenerating scr catalyst would be reduced and our ability to operate scr tech profitably could be compromised 
there are risks associated with our purchase of used scr catalyst 
scr tech s primary business involves the cleaning and regenerating of customer owned scr catalyst 
in certain instances  however  scr tech may purchase used or spent catalyst from utilities for regeneration  as when  for example  a utility wishes to avoid the costs and potential hazardous waste issues associated with the disposal of used or spent catalyst 
scr tech may purchase scr catalyst for a nominal sum and then regenerate such catalyst for immediate sale  or may purchase spent scr catalyst on an opportunistic basis for future regeneration and sale 
the purchase of spent scr catalyst involves potential risks to scr tech 
for example  spent scr catalyst includes significant hazardous waste  and unlike the regeneration of customer owned scr catalyst  the purchase of spent scr catalyst requires scr tech to take ownership or title to the scr catalyst  which may potentially increase scr tech s environmental risk exposure 
furthermore  if scr tech cannot find a customer to purchase the regenerated catalyst  then scr tech must either store the spent catalyst  subject to the inherent risk of holding catalyst which has not been regenerated and contains hazardous waste  or incur significant costs to dispose of the spent catalyst in a manner which complies with the strict requirements of applicable environmental laws 
in addition  the sale of scr catalyst may expose scr tech to risks not inherent in the cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst  including product liability claims 
it is unclear as to the amount of scr catalyst which scr tech may purchase  but it is possible such purchases ultimately may be substantial  and may significantly increase the risk profile of scr tech s business 
many of the risks of our business have only limited insurance coverage and many of our business risks are uninsurable 
our business operations are subject to potential environmental  product liability  employee and other risks 
although we have insurance to cover some of these risks  the amount of this insurance is limited and includes numerous exceptions and limitations to coverage 
further  no insurance is available to cover certain types of risks  such as acts of god  war  terrorism  major economic and business disruptions and similar events 
in the event we were to suffer a significant environmental  product liability  employee or other claim in excess of our insurance or a loss or damages relating to an uninsurable risk  our financial condition could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the cost of our insurance has increased substantially in recent years and may prove to be prohibitively expensive  thus making it impractical to obtain insurance 
this may result in the need to abandon certain business activities or subject ourselves to the risks of uninsured operations 
new technologies could be developed which make scr catalyst obsolete 
scr tech s business is dependent upon the needs of coal fired power plants to replace or regenerate scr catalyst 
it is possible that at some point in the future new technology may be developed which replaces scr catalyst as the preferred solution for removing nox from the power plant exhaust 
in such event  scr tech s business would be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to dsit solutions failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce our margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  we undertake to deliver software or integrated hardware software solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by our success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  our costs are substantially higher than expected  we may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli hi tech market and may harm our israeli operations  our israeli operations may be negatively affected by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service 
our software consulting and development services segment is currently conducted in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit 
any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi tech market  which may result in a significant deterioration of the results of our israeli operations 
in addition  an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to our israeli operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to our offices or those of our customers or harm to our personnel 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of our israeli operations 
a majority of dsit s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u 
s dollars or are in new israeli shekels nis linked to the us dollar 
at the same time  most of dsit s expenses are denominated in nis primarily labor costs and are not linked to any foreign currency 
while the dollar value of the revenues of our operations in israel will increase if the dollar is devalued in relation to the nis  the net effect of such devaluation is that dsit s costs in dollar terms increase more than our revenues 
the translation of the balance sheets of our israeli operations from nis into us dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded either as cumulative translation adjustments cta within stockholders equity  or foreign exchange gains or losses in the statement of operations 
in the nis strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
as of december   a weakening of the us dollar against the nis would have increased stockholders equity by approximately million arising from a cta adjustment of approximately million and net exchange gains of approximately million 
these hypothetical changes are based on adjusting the december  exchange rates by 
dsit currently enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations  however  we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully 
we are substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline 
in  of dsit s revenues were concentrated in two customers 
both of these customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit s revenues and cash flow for a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit 
we are dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for operations 
our present operations  as we are currently structured  place a great reliance on our meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance our operations 
should we encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones  resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological change  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
some of our solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence 
our competitiveness and future success depends on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
our failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in technological obsolescence  decreased revenues  and or a loss of market share to competitors 
to the extent that we fail to keep pace with technological change  our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects 
some of the projects we perform require significant performance and or bank guarantees 
in dsit s current financial condition  it may not always be able to supply such guarantees without financial assistance from acorn 
if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit  acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to us in a timely manner 
we are dependent on a number of suppliers who provide us with components for some of our products 
a number of our suppliers provide us with major components for some of our products for our naval rt solutions 
some of these components are long lead items 
if for some reason  the suppliers cannot provide us with the component when we need it and we cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms  we may have increased costs and or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence 
in addition  project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while we are constantly attempting to develop secondary and tertiary suppliers for these components  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us 
we are dependent on one bank for most of our financing needs and we may not be able to obtain necessary financing to continue growing the company 
while dsit has recently received a term loan of nis million approximately  and has lines of credit of nis million  dsit needs additional financing from time to time due to the timing of large milestone payments and the need to set aside cash deposits as security for some of its projects 
due to historical losses  dsit has found it difficult to find a suitable secondary bank to support its financing needs 
if we cannot increase our sources of financing  we may not be able to sustain our recent growth and invest in expanding our portfolio of products 
we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  which may hinder our ability to compete effectively 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
risks related to coreworx coreworx has incurred significant net losses since inception and may never achieve sustained profitability 
coreworx has incurred net losses of c and c million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that coreworx will reduce its losses in  however  we can provide no assurance that coreworx will generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
coreworx may need additional financing cash used in operations in and was c million and c million  respectively 
coreworx will continue to require additional working capital support in order to finance its operations in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
since january   we have lent coreworx million 
we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
current and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits the market for project management collaboration software is highly competitive 
coreworx competes with products from major software companies 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter into each of our markets 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace 
we could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors introduce new competitive products  add new functionality to existing products  acquire competitive products  reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies 
if other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our products and services  we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products we offer 
this could result in lower revenues or reduced margins  either of which may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of coreworx 
the primary market for our software and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain 
if the markets for our products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition  our business will suffer 
as a result  we may be unable to i successfully market our current products and services  ii develop new software products  services and enhancements to current products and services  iii complete customer installations on a timely basis  or iv complete products and services currently under development 
if our products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace  our business and operating results will be materially affected 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that coreworx will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives 
our investment in our current research and development efforts may not be effective 
the development of software products is a costly  complex and time consuming process  and the investment in software product development often involves a long gestation period until a return is achieved on such an investment 
we make and will continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development 
these expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by revenue increases 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position 
however  significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
moreover  new products and services may not be profitable  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical products and services 
the demand for our products depends in large part on continued growth in the industries into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries could have a material negative impact on our results of operations 
our growth is dependent  in part  on capital projects initiated by our customers and potential customers 
any industry downturns that adversely affect our customers or their customers  including increases in bankruptcies in relevant industries  could adversely affect end user demand for our customers products  which would adversely affect demand for our products 
growth in demand in the markets we serve has in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels of our current and potential customers  consumer spending  energy and commodity prices and general economic conditions 
the rate  or extent to which  the industries we serve will grow  if at all  is uncertain 
the industries we serve are currently experiencing a decline in general economic conditions  which could result in slower growth or a decline in demand for our products  which could have a material negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the canadian dollar significantly strengthens relative to the us dollar  future operating results will be negatively affected 
coreworx currently derives over of its revenue in us dollars 
at the same time  most of coreworx expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
a decline in the value of the us dollar will have a major impact on coreworx profitability as it increases coreworx costs in us dollars 
the translation of the balance sheets of coreworx operations from c into us dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded either as cta within stockholders equity  or foreign exchange gains or losses in the statement of operations 
in the canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
as of december   a weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would have increased stockholders equity by approximately million arising from a cta adjustment of approximately million 
these hypothetical changes are based on adjusting the december  exchange rates by 
while coreworx has in the past been successful in reducing the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate through currency management  there is no assurance that coreworx will be able to successfully manage these exposures in the future 
any significant change in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue  earnings and other financial measures 
revenue from the renewal of maintenance contracts on our older software sales may decline 
coreworx has historically enjoyed a high retention rate across its various product lines 
as coreworx products age  these retention rates may not be sustained unless coreworx is successful in providing its customers with more advanced functionality and the levels of support that they require 
the loss of licenses to use or sell third party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect coreworx business 
coreworx depends on the sale and support of third party software for a significant component of its primary software product 
there can be no assurance that these third party products will be available on commercially reasonable terms or that they will be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
while coreworx would make its best efforts to mitigate the impact of the loss of the ability to use  sell and support third party software  there is no assurance that coreworx would be successful or that the terms for their use will remain economically feasible 
the inability to use the third party software could have a material adverse affect on our business 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could have a material negative impact on net sales 
in  of coreworx revenue was the result of sales to five customers 
in addition  in any given quarter  license sales from individual transactions can be material and in some cases the related sales cycles can be long 
as a result  coreworx revenue  cash flows and earnings can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter due to the timing of significant license agreements 
the loss or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could have a material negative impact on coreworx results of operations and revenues  cash flows and earnings 
our future revenues depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products 
coreworx needs to continue to upgrade the coreworx suite to add features demanded by the market 
coreworx is in the process of completing and enhancing its coreworx suite with functionality in the areas of interface management  contract management and developing a nuclear industry solution that addresses project execution and information control requirements for major refurbishment  power uprate and new build projects and expects to complete the integration by the end of the second quarter of a failure to complete updates of these offerings on a timely basis could have a negative impact on coreworx sales  particularly to potential new customers 
coreworx future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products  to keep pace with technological developments and respond to end user requirements 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in developing or marketing new products or product enhancements  or that we can avoid significant delays in development in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to continue to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry  including providing for the continued compatibility of our software products with evolving computer hardware and software platforms and operating environments 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose us to warranty claims and litigation 
our products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of shipments to our customers 
if these defects are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner 
in addition  despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our products  we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products will operate and  as a result  we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software errors which may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in our products could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products  alleviating such errors and failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources 
the harm to our reputation resulting from product errors and failures may be materially damaging 
since we regularly provide a warranty with our products  the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
our agreements with our strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims 
these agreements usually contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims 
although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect our financial condition 
the sales cycle for our products is long which may result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter 
the decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across our customers network or networks 
as a result  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software  our sales cycle may be longer compared to companies in other industries 
it may in some cases take several months  or even several quarters  for marketing opportunities to materialize into sales 
if a customer s decision to license our software is delayed or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which we may recognize revenue from these licenses would be delayed 
such delays could cause volatility in our reported revenues from period to period 
risks related to our securities our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since january  our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  changes in accounting rules  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options 
almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are  or could upon exercise of options or warrants would become  eligible for sale in the public market as described below 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility of these sales  may adversely affect our stock price 
as of march    shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding 
as of that date we had  warrants outstanding and exercisable with an exercise price of and  options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of per share  which if exercised would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock 
in addition to the options noted above  at march    options are outstanding  but have not yet vested and are not yet exercisable 
in addition  we expect to issue approximately million additional shares in connection with our pending acquisitions of gridsense and decision dynamics   of which will be freely tradable upon issuance   within six months of issuance and the balance one year after issuance

overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we operate in three reportable segments coalogix  naval and rt solutions and eis 
we acquired our interest in coreworx which comprises our eis segment on august   our results for include coreworx results only for the period following the acquisition date 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
coalogix in december  coalogix completed its expansion to its scr tech regeneration facility 
the expansion increased the overall efficiency of the facility and approximately doubled its throughput capacity 
this expansion will enable scr tech to meet the growing demands of the catalyst and catalyst regeneration markets 
coalogix revenues in were million compared to revenues of million 
the increase in coalogix s revenues in compared to is due to increased penetration in the growing regeneration market 
coalogix revenues in the fourth quarter of of million represent a increase over fourth quarter revenues of million and an increase in third quarter revenues of million 
the year on year increase in revenues was attributable largely to increased production volume facilitated by the plant expansion 
the increase from third quarter revenues was due primarily to seasonal factors since power plants typically do not schedule service of the catalyst systems during the spring and summer ozone months 
during that time  coalogix increased its inventory of scr modules available for sale by processing them during these periods of excess production capacity 
coalogix gross profit in was million compared to gross profit of million 
the increase in coalogix gross profit in was attributable to both the increase in revenues combined with increased efficiencies in production 
gross margins increased from in to in gross margins in were negatively impacted due to certain projects being performed with negative margins caused by longer than expected times to complete these projects and by higher costs of the raw materials due to the product mix 
coalogix gross profit in the fourth quarter of was million representing a million increase over the gross profit of million recorded by coalogix in the fourth quarter of coalogix gross profit in the fourth quarter of also represented a million increase in gross profit compared to the third quarter of the increase in coalogix fourth quarter gross profit for over was attributable to increased sales combined with improved efficiencies 
the increase in coalogix fourth quarter gross profit compared to the third quarter of was attributable to the increase in sales million combined with third quarter gross profit being negatively impacted due to seasonal factors since power plants typically do not schedule service of the catalyst systems during the spring and summer ozone months 
in april  we entered into the purchase agreement with coalogix  enertech capital partners iii lp enertech and certain members of coalogix s senior management pursuant to which acorn and enertech each agreed to purchase from coalogix  shares of common stock for a purchase price of million  and certain members of coalogix s senior management agreed to purchase  shares of common stock of coalogix for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  proceeds of the sale of the common stock will be used by coalogix for plant expansion  technology development  legal expenses and computer software 
to date  coalogix has received approximately million of the total million commitment by acorn  enertech and management 
a majority of the expenditures to date has been for technology development and legal costs associated with pending legal actions to which coalogix is a party item legal proceedings  with a portion also being used as a security deposit for guarantees provided the coalogix 
in the coming year  coalogix expects to invest significant portions of the remaining funds million in developing its new facilities and legal fees with respect to the abovementioned legal actions 
during  coalogix engaged an outside firm to assist coalogix with the determination of the economic viability of metallifix 
on december   the outside firm issued its assessment that metallifix is not economically viable and not competitive with other commercial products for mercury control that are currently available 
on december   the management of coalogix determined that a material impairment of metallifix had occurred 
accordingly  coalogix recorded an impairment charge of the remaining unamortized balance of the solucorp license million as well as associated assets chemicals million and prepaid chemicals million 
in  we expect coalogix to improve on its results based upon on its year end backlog for scr services of million and anticipated new orders combined with the expected increased capacity from its second facility expected to begin operations in the end of the second quarter of dsit solutions in  dsit continued to focus on marketing and developing its naval solutions products  particularly its products related to underwater security for energy and other strategic sites 
revenue of our dsit subsidiary increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was due to increased revenue in the naval and rt solutions segment while other revenue remained stable 
fourth quarter revenue for dsit was million reflecting a million increase over fourth quarter revenue of million 
gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects an increase of million or from million in dsit s gross profit of million during the fourth quarter of represented a million increase over dsit s gross profit in the fourth quarter of the increase in gross profit was attributable to both increased revenue and increased gross margins 
dsit s improved its gross margin to in as compared to in dsit s increased gross margins were due to a shifting of focus to higher margin naval projects in naval rt solutions during and  revenues from our naval rt solutions in our dsit subsidiary were million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately and of dsit s revenues for and  respectively 
the balance of dsit s revenues of million for each of the years ending december  and  were derived from dsit s other it and consulting activities 
segment revenues increased by million or in as compared to the increase in sales was the result of revenue recorded from the sale of dsit s aquashield dds systems to an undisclosed emea customer which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues recorded in other real time and embedded hardware and software projects 
segment gross profit also increased from million in to million in as a result of the increased sales and change in revenue mix which was concentrated in higher margin naval projects 
the change in revenue mix to higher margin naval projects increased our segment gross margin from in to in we anticipate continued growth in sales in  particularly from our acoustic and sonar solutions projects with our embedded hardware and software development projects expected to remain relatively stable 
at end of  we have received million of new orders for our aquashield dds 
dsit recorded net income of million in million in and expects to be profitable as well 
coreworx coreworx  which we acquired on august   had sales in of c million compared to full year sales of c million 
the increase in coreworx sales in compared to was principally due to new license sales 
coreworx gross profit in was c million compared to gross profit of c million 
coreworx gross margin was relatively stable in compared to coreworx generally sells its software on a per seat license basis 
coreworx profit margin depends upon the customer s requirements for a particular project and the resources coreworx has to devote to such project 
in june  acorn lent million to coreworx to support its development of a new project information software for the nuclear power plant industry 
during the second half of  coreworx continued its increased focus on providing its software solutions to the nuclear power industry 
coreworx is planning to deliver a nuclear industry solution that addresses project execution and information control requirements for major refurbishment  modifications to the original plant design to increase the maximum capacity output at which the plant can operate and new build projects 
the nuclear industry solution will address regulatory compliance  document traceability  and work processes that utilize best practices in managing major capital projects 
market conditions that coreworx believes will drive nuclear solutions as a growing source of revenue include an increasing world wide energy demand  an aging north american nuclear infrastructure  and public pressure to provide clean air electricity sources that reduce dependency on overseas supplies of fossil fuel 
in december  coreworx received its first order for its nuclear industry solution from babcock wilcox nuclear power generation  inc b w 
b w will employ coreworx support software in the development  licensing and delivery of the innovative new b w mpower nuclear reactor 
in the period from january  to march   acorn lent an additional million to coreworx for its product development and for working capital 
coreworx will require additional working capital support to accelerate its nuclear and contract management product offerings in order to achieve market readiness in mid this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional loans or investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional funding to coreworx from us may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
in  we expect coreworx to improve on its results based upon several factors which include the launching of an aggressive marketing program  hiring of additional sales staff  realization of its latin american development program  offering more products and cross selling opportunities attributable to the planned decision dynamics technology ltd 
ddy acquisition see recent developments 
in  coreworx plans to significantly invest in its marketing activities including trade show and industry association participation  integrated web and email marketing  additional lead generation activities and analyst relations 
by february  coreworx had more than doubled its sales force from including sales coverage specifically for the nuclear industry in north america and australian based sales coverage 
for the second half of  coreworx plans to develop a channel of business partners in the latin american region and expects to begin generating revenue from this channel in the latter half of in addition  beginning in the first quarter of  coreworx plans to introduce a net new product line each quarter effectively tripling its overall target market 
corporate at the end of  we began an effort to streamline our corporate costs 
towards that end  we have took several steps in order to conserve our corporate cash including hiring in house counsel  reducing personnel  consulting and marketing costs 
the result of those steps can be seen in the decrease in our corporate administrative expenses excluding non cash stock compensation expense which were reduced from million in to million in we believe our corporate administrative expenses in will increase as we have recently hired a cto to build relations with major energy companies and academic institutions as well as to strengthen and expand our technology portfolio 
we expect to continue to have significant corporate expenses and will continue to expend in the future  significant amounts of funds on professional fees and other costs in connection with our strategy to seek out and invest in companies that fit our target business model 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies  which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  business combinations  impairments in goodwill and intangible assets  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions and stock based compensation 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in other entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and or our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investee s net income or losses after the date of investment 
when net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount  the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not recorded 
we resume accounting for the investment under the equity method when the entity subsequently reports net income and our share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
during  we took equity losses of  in our investment in gridsense  which reduced our investment in gridsense down to zero 
we also recorded an impairment of  in our investment in enertech which is accounted for under the cost method 
our investment in ussi is also accounted for under the cost method 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as an amortizable intangible asset  a non amortizable intangible asset or goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of our amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from seven to sixteen years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill and intangibles as a result of our various acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and various amortizable intangible assets 
we also sometimes acquire specific intangibles such as our acquisition in of a license agreement with solucorp industries ltd 
our goodwill at december  was approximately million 
our goodwill is allocated to our segments as follows coalogix approximately million  naval rt solutions approximately million and eis approximately million 
we determine whether the carrying value of recorded goodwill is impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the first step of the impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
the second step measures the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
fair values are determined either by using a discounted cash flow methodology or by using a combination of a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows  assumed discount rates and other assumptions as deemed appropriate 
we consider factors such as historical performance  anticipated market conditions  operating expense trends and capital expenditure requirements 
additionally  the discounted cash flows analysis takes into consideration cash expenditures for further product development 
with respect to the goodwill in our eis segment coreworx  it was assumed the most of the existing debt by coreworx to acorn would not be repaid and would be converted to equity 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter 
we determined that none of our reporting units were impaired as a result of our annual tests in our intangible assets that have finite useful lives recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition  and are carried at such value less accumulated amortization 
our intangible assets at december  consisted of scr technologies in our coalogix segment million  net of accumulated amortization  naval technologies in our naval rt solutions segment million  net of accumulated amortization and software and customer relationships in our eis segment million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we amortize these intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
during  coalogix engaged an outside firm to assist coalogix with the determination of the economic viability of the technology associated with the license acquired from solucorp 
in december  the outside firm issued its assessment that the technology was not economically viable and not competitive with other commercial products for mercury control that are currently available 
on december   the management of coalogix determined that a material impairment of the license had occurred 
accordingly  coalogix recorded an impairment charge of the remaining unamortized balance of the solucorp license million as well as associated assets chemicals million and prepaid chemicals million 
revenue recognition in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our coalogix subsidiary 
revenues related to scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are recognized when the service is completed for each catalyst module 
customer acceptance is not required for regeneration and cleaning services in that coalogix s contracts currently provide that services are completed upon receipt of testing by independent third parties confirming compliance with contract requirements 
from time to time  coalogix purchases spent catalyst modules for its inventory 
in the event that a customer purchases spent catalyst modules and enters a service contract for regeneration with coalogix  revenues are recognized when the service is completed for each catalyst module 
costs associated with performing scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are expensed as incurred because of the close correlation between the costs incurred  the extent of performance achieved and the revenue recognized 
in the situation where revenue is deferred due to collectability uncertainties  coalogix does not defer costs due to the uncertainties related to payment for such services 
in the situation where revenue is deferred due to the non completion of regeneration services  the company defers the related costs as deferred costs 
revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services is recognized as services are provided 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our dsit subsidiary 
in  dsit derived approximately million or of its revenues from fixed price type contracts 
fixed price type contracts require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized for a particular period  using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected and losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
at coreworx  we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable revenue recognition guidance relating to software 
coreworx revenues of approximately million represents approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 
our application of applicable accounting principles requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
revenues derived from multiple element software sale arrangements are recognized in earnings based on the relative fair values of the individual elements 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our pcs renewal experience 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
if the revenue recognition criteria above are not satisfied  amounts received from customers are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar 
accordingly  the company and all of its us subsidiaries use the dollar as their functional currency 
coreworx s  functional currency is the canadian dollar c and dsit s functional currency is the new israeli shekel nis 
in the year ended december   of our consolidated revenues in the year ended december  came from our dsit subsidiary while and of our consolidated revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively  came from our coreworx subsidiary 
their financial statements have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statements of operations amounts have been translated using the exchange rate at date of transaction 
all exchange gains and losses denominated in non functional currencies are reflected in finance expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise 
stock based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of applicable accounting principles  using the black scholes option valuation method 
accordingly  we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the black scholes method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
the expected volatility factor used to value stock options in was based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock over a period equal to the estimated weighted average life of the options 
for the expected term of the option  we used an estimate of the expected option life based on historical experience 
the risk free interest rate used is based upon us treasury yields for a period consistent with the expected term of the options 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the prescribed methodology  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our selling  general and administrative and other items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
we are also required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for each of the years ended december  and  we incurred stock compensation expense of approximately million 
the and expense includes million of stock compensation expense recorded in each year with respect to stock option grants in our coalogix and coreworx subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation

revenues increased by million or to million in as compared to sales of million in the increase in revenue was partially attributable to the inclusion of coreworx revenue of million in compared to the million of coreworx revenue from the date of our acquisition on august  through december  included in our results 
the balance of the increase in revenue was due to the increase in coalogix revenue of million to million compared to revenue of million 
dsit s naval rt solutions consolidated segment revenue increased from million to million 
the increase in coalogix revenue was due to continued penetration in the regeneration market combined with the ability to process more scr modules facilitated by the completion of a plant expansion in the fourth quarter the increase in dsit s naval rt solutions revenues was due to increased revenues from dsit s aquashieldtm projects 
gross profit 
gross profit in increased by million or  to million from million in the increase in gross profit was attributable to the inclusion of coreworx gross profit in of million compared to the gross profit of million recorded for coreworx following our acquisition in august in addition  both coalogix and dsit recorded increased gross profits of million an increase of and million an increase of  respectively 
the increase in both coalogix and dsit gross profits were attributable to both the increase in sales as well as increased margins 
gross margin for coalogix increased from in to in reflecting greater operational efficiency since the plant expansion at the end of consolidated gross margin in dsit s naval and rt solutions segment increased from in to in due to an increase in the higher margin aquashieldtm projects worked on in acquired in process research and development expenses ipr d

dsit s sg a costs increased by million in compared to corporate general and administrative costs decreased by million reflecting the effects of our efforts to reduce corporate costs 
impairments 
during  we recorded impairments totaling million 
the impairments were primarily comprised of million with respect to coalogix s determination that its acquired metallifix technology was not economically viable 
as a result  coalogix recorded an impairment charge on the unamortized balance of the acquired technology and all associated assets 
during  we recorded impairments totaling million 
the impairments related to a loss provision on our loans to paketeria of million due to paketeria s increasing operating difficulties and our doubts as to its ability to repay its debt to us and its ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition  we recorded a loss provision on the note payable from gridsense of million due to doubts of gridsense s ability to repay the note 
we also recorded a loss of million resulting from the impairment of our investment in and loans to local power 
gain on early redemption of debenture 
in  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we recorded a non cash gain of approximately million in connection with the january redemption of our convertible debentures 
finance expense  net 
the decrease in finance expense in compared with is primarily due to the interest expense of million recorded with respect to the write off of the remaining balances of debt origination costs  warrants value and beneficial conversion features in the early redemption of our convertible debentures 
gain on sale of shares in comverge 
in  we sold all of the  shares of comverge shares that we held at the beginning of and recorded a pre tax gain of million on proceeds of million 
in  we sold  of our comverge shares of and recorded a pre tax gain of million on proceeds of million 
taxes on income 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of million  primarily as the result of recording an income tax receivable million due to our expected utilization of current year net losses to carry back to recover previous years tax payments and recognizing deferred tax assets million in our profitable dsit subsidiary 
in  we recorded a non cash expense of million with respect to the elimination of deferred tax assets from our balance sheet due to the reduction in the value of comverge shares 
this was partially offset by a tax benefit of million for overpayment of previous year s taxes and million resulting from our receipt of an exemption of income taxes from the state of delaware thus reducing our effective income tax rate on domestic earnings to 
share of income losses in paketeria 
in the third quarter of  liquidation proceedings began with respect to paketeria 
previously  in  our investment in paketeria was reduced to zero and we ceased recording losses in paketeria 
as a result of the liquidation proceedings  we eliminated the previously recorded cumulative translation adjustment of million associated with the investment in paketeria and recognized that amount as share of income in paketeria 
in  we recorded a loss of million of which approximately million represents our approximate share of paketeria s losses for and approximately million representing amortization expense associated with acquired intangibles and approximately million representing the impairment of the balance of our investment 
share of losses in gridsense 
in  we recorded a loss of  representing our share of gridsense s losses for we have ceased recording our share of losses in gridsense as our investment balance has been reduced to zero 
in  we recorded losses of  representing our share of gridsense s losses and amortization of intangibles for the first nine months of as we recorded our share of losses in gridsense on a three month lag due to our inability to receive financial information on a timely basis 
in addition  in  as a result of the steep  continuous decline in the share price of gridsense  we determined that the decline in value was other than temporary  and  accordingly recorded an impairment of  in the value of gridsense to bring the value of our investment in gridsense to its market value on the toronto stock exchange on that date 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million in compared with net loss of million in our loss in was due to impairments million  primarily with respect to the impairment of our metallifix technology  coreworx losses of million and corporate expenses of million  partially offset by the gain recognized on our sale of comverge shares of million and net income from our dsit subsidiary of million 
net loss attributable to non controlling interests 
of our losses in and   and  was attributable to non controlling interests in our coalogix and dsit subsidiaries 
all of our  of losses in were attributable to non controlling interests in coalogix 
in   of our losses were attributable to non controlling interests in coalogix 
this was offset by  of income that was attributable to non controlling interests in dsit 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents not including current and non current restricted deposits of million of which we expect approximately million to be released in the first half of 
net cash used in the year ending december   was million  of which million was used in operating activities 
the primary use of cash in operating activities during was the cash used in operations by our coreworx and coalogix subsidiaries of million and the million  respectively as well as the million of cash used in our corporate operations 
dsit generated approximately million of cash from its operating activities during cash provided by investing activities of million was primarily due to the million of proceeds from the sale of our comverge shares and covered calls during the period and million from the release of restricted deposits associated with one of dsit s projects 
those proceeds amounts were offset by new restricted deposits of approximately million as security for new dsit and coalogix projects  million for the acquisition of property and equipment  million for investment in enertech arising from capital calls  a million loan to gridsense and an investment of million in ussi 
net cash of million was provided for in financing activities  primarily from the million investment made by enertech and coalogix management in coalogix  the million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options and the proceeds from a term loan of million for our dsit subsidiary 
these proceeds were partially offset by the redemption of our debentures million  the purchase of treasury shares million and the payment for additional shares of dsit million 
at december   dsit had approximately  in israeli credit lines available to dsit from an israeli bank   of which was then being used  net of secured deposits 
dsit s credit lines are available to it until february  are denominated in nis and bear interest at a weighted average rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
the line of credit is subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
at december   dsit was in compliance with its financial covenants 
the company has a floating lien and provided guarantees with respect to dsit s outstanding lines of credit 
in addition  acorn has agreed to be supportive of dsit s liquidity requirements over the next months 
on december   dsit took a term loan from an israeli bank in the amount of  the loan is denominated in nis and bears interest at the rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the loan is to be repaid over a period of months of equal payments of approximately  per month principal and interest 
as collateral for the term loan  dsit has deposited with an israeli bank  as a non current restricted deposit 
in addition to this restricted deposit  dsit has also deposited with an israeli bank  as collateral for various performance and bank guarantees for various projects 
dsit expects that a majority of these deposits will be released in the first half of  but expects to deposit these funds again as collateral for guarantees for new projects 
on march   dsit was utilizing approximately  of its  line of credit 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flows from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and expected continued improvement of operating results from anticipated growth in sales 
dsit is continuing to search for additional sources of financing to support its growth 
in october  coalogix signed an agreement with square bank for a million formula based line of credit 
on march   coalogix was utilizing  of its line of credit 
the line of credit expires on april  and bears interest at prime plus 
the us prime rate at december  was 
coalogix is negotiating more favorable terms and expects to renew the line of credit before the extension period expires 
the line of credit is for financing coalogix s working capital and to finance its growth and is subject to certain financial covenants 
we believe that coalogix will have sufficient liquidity to finance its operating activities from cash flow from its own operations and its bank financing over the next months 
we expect that coreworx will require additional working capital support in order to finance its working capital needs in since january   we have lent coreworx million 
we expect coreworx need for additional working capital to lessen as it releases its new products during  however  we have no assurance that coreworx will be able to generate sufficient sales to generate positive cash flows 
thus  coreworx may continue to require additional working capital support in the coming months 
additional support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us in coreworx may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
we expect that gridsense will require additional working capital support in order to finance its working capital needs in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
acorn  in its planned acquisition of the ownership interest of gridsense not previously owned by acorn  committed to provide gridsense with additional working capital of up to million in debt or equity or a combination of both 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn in gridsense may be limited by the working capital needs of acorn s corporate activities and other operating companies 
prior to the company s recent capital raise  the company s corporate operations not including cash at any of our subsidiaries had a total of approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents reflecting a million decrease from the balance as of december  the decrease in unrestricted corporate cash is due primarily to a loan of approximately million given to our coreworx subsidiary  an additional  investment in ussi and a loan of  to gridsense 
those expenditures were partially offset by our receipt of  loan repayment from our dsit subsidiary 
following the capital raise  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  we had a total of million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our current cash plus the cash generated from operations will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance the activities of acorn and its operating companies for the foreseeable future and for the next months in particular

under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment under certain other circumstances

certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
our dsit subsidiary provides various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and were due to expire through as security for a portion of these guarantees  acorn has deposited with an israeli bank approximately million and dsit has deposited approximately million which is shown as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects a majority of the restricted cash to be released in early  however  dsit expects to provide additional security deposits for new guarantees for new projects throughout the calendar year 
our coalogix subsidiary provides various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and were due to expire through as a security for a portion of these guarantees  the company has deposited with a us bank approximately million which is shown as a restricted deposit on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects million of the restricted deposit to be released in impact of inflation and currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our lines of credit  available and long term debt incurred  balance at december  to finance our operations in israel 
our non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities net assets of approximately million at december  in israel are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
furthermore  million and million of our backlog of projects are contracts and orders that are denominated in nis and linked to an israeli ministry of defense index  and denominated in nis  respectively 
historically  a majority of dsit s sales have been denominated in dollars or denominated in nis linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are often settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
as dsit increases its sales to customers to customers outside of israel  a greater portion of its receipts from customers will be settled in dollars 
in  we expect a significant portion of dsit s sales to be settled in dollars 
a significant majority of dsit s expenses in israel are in nis primarily labor costs  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the appreciation of the nis against the dollar was while in it was 
inflation in israel was in and during during the first two months of  the dollar appreciated by against the nis and inflation in israel during this period was negative 
as of december   virtually all of dsit s monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
dsit purchases forward contracts to attempt to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition  our non us dollar assets and liabilities net liability of approximately million at december  in canada at our coreworx subsidiary are also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the dollar cost of our operations in canada may also be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
in the appreciation of the us dollar against the canadian dollar was 
during the first two months of  the us dollar appreciated by against the canadian dollar 
as of december   virtually all of coreworx s assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars were denominated in canadian dollars 
in the event that in the future we have material net assets or liabilities that are not denominated in us dollars  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations
